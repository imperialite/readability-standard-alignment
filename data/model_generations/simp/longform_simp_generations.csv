"A beautiful day for a perfect swap. As Amanda writes: I spent the afternoon at home with my two little daughters. It was my first day of work since I was a waitress! I loved being in the sun with my friends and enjoying the company of my work colleagues! It was one of the best days I’ve had in my life. I love the fact that I get to give my daughters a chance to learn about another culture while also working part time. I really enjoyed my day at work and I hope I do it again. I was really amazed at the amount of different cultures that are all over the world. I feel completely different to everyone I knew, and there's lots of new things to learn and see. I really enjoyed my day with Cindy! Cindy's story I've never been inside anything remotely like it before. I couldn’t believe how dark and noisy it was. There were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was amazing to be working alongside people and helping them get on with their lives and just do the things you normally do but you've probably never thought about doing. It was great working with so many different people. I met lots of people from all over the world, and really got to know them. The staff are great to work alongside too. I really enjoyed my day! A. Amanda's story I never thought I'd get to use my phone while in the restaurant, but","Cindy’s story I’d never been in anything remotely like it before. There were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was great for the kids to be able to play outside at last! It also made me think about the pressures of working life. Sometimes you just need a break. I have two daughters, but that took their time. I was just happy to have them and their dad around so I could relax and have some fun with my daughter and my husband. My family thought it was a bit strange, but it was fun to do something different. They were happy they got to spend some time with their dad. Cindy’s story I’d never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. There were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was great for the kids to be able to play outside at last! It was great to take them out and just enjoy the outdoors again. I love when the children get to play in the park. They are always so amazed to see their dad. It has given my girls more excitement to go and visit the park with their dad. The children love going - they absolutely love it! It made me think of all the other things I would like to do. For example, we could go on holiday somewhere new, learn about a new language or just try out a new hobby. I would love to go to a farm. For a change I would like","Cindy's story Cindy’s life was incredibly different to mine. I’d never had kids and I’d never worked in a restaurant and entertainment complex before. It was amazing. The food was fantastic and so were the people, it was amazing. Everything about my day was brilliant. We had a nice lunch at a local Indian restaurant. Then we took a cab to an old British pub for dinner. We had a great evening at a nice restaurant and it was such a great experience. Cindy’s story Cindy was a waitress at an upscale restaurant in the city centre. I had never seen anything like it before. It was really dark and glitzy. It was very busy with a lot of people around and lots of noise. It was awesome. I met a really nice man, who took us to dinner at the restaurant. I liked the food, it was really good. Cindy’s story Cindy loved the food, it was very tasty. It was very noisy inside - it was so busy. We had an ice cream and the pub was very noisy. We had an ice cream. Then we went to the pub for a drink. Cindy loved it. It was a great night. I think it was really fun for us. We can talk to the waitress if we want. It was a great day. It was very fun. It was","Cindy (33) was a waitress for four years at a large London restaurant and entertainment complex. She'd never been inside anything remotely like it before. She enjoyed the busy atmosphere of the restaurant but thought it might be difficult to fit in the kids' activities on offer. Cindy was also concerned that it might become hard for her to work around Amanda's two daughters because she is busy trying to find more work. He thinks that having a baby will make her even busier, so she has put a special deal up online that they can all have a baby swap. The girls also got in on the act - Cindy worked with her little girls - and both enjoyed watching them on the play room. Bob (44) worked at a large supermarket chain. He felt that it would be hard to fit in the shopping with the other customers at the supermarket, so he decided to swap with his wife for the day. He was worried that the girls would be unhappy with their new mother, as he is tired of seeing her all day everyday. His wife, Joanne, and the children had to go to school to ensure that he had time to work.","A: Yes, we all had a good time and we all had some very interesting experiences, as you can see from their photos. A. Cindy’s story I was very happy that I got to swap my life with Amanda. She was very interesting and she was very nice to have around for a day. She also had a lot of fun and enjoyed looking at different people’s lives. A. Kate’s story My husband and I were very different people, and it was amazing that we could swap our lives and have such different experiences. Neither of us were used to having a family and it was fun to experience life with another person. A. Caroline’s story This was the first time I'd ever had coffee with a woman who worked at a hotel. It was very interesting, and I could see why it is one of her favourite things to do. It was amazing to see her living the life that she had, and her family, so I was looking forward to it. I have a brother-in-law who works in a hotel so I was looking forward to seeing him again. It was great to see him again! A. I wasn’t even sure if I'd like him at first, but he was incredibly interesting. We both felt that he was very interesting and different to us. Caroline's story This was the first time I had coffee with a woman who worked","I have just started work in the restaurant. It is very loud and busy. I like my job, I like my colleagues and the atmosphere is brilliant. It was such a change to be living with Cindy for the day. I could really see how she thinks.","They were all young mothers with two daughters. Cindy was the host mother, Amanda was the waitress. We arranged that both women would work at the same restaurant and entertainment complex in London for an entire day. Cindy was a waitress at a popular restaurant in London, while Amanda was a busy mother with two daughters. They both got to experience life in the opposite direction and swapped lives on the day. We asked them to enact a story they would tell of the day and they did it. 1. They took their daughters to a lovely day out and then drove back to their normal home in England. 2. They got to spend a whole day with their partner or partner's family, then they returned to their normal lives. 4. They were all treated to a delicious dinner, and then they had a bath."
"Amongst so many notable women in Britain, little is known about the life of Dorothy Hodgkin. We learn only that she is the only British woman scientist ever to win a Nobel Prize, awarded in Physiology or Medicine for her work on skin cancer, a disease that often results in malignant lymph nodes on the face. But despite her remarkable achievement, Hodgkin is little known in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, the author of an upcoming biography of the pioneering surgeon. As she puts it, ""the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel prize ought to be a household name in her own country."" Her story goes far beyond the Nobel Prize, however. Her work on skin cancer changed medicine. It revealed the mechanisms by which our immune system kills cancer cells. Scientists have long suspected the possibility that the skin is just an extension of our body and that the cancer cells are an extension of our body. But this work, which led to the first clinical trials of the treatment, was conducted in 1950, and she and her colleagues made a discovery that would be the basis of chemotherapy. It is called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and is used to prevent cancer recurrence. Her success led to the development of new and effective drug treatments for skin cancers. However, Hodgkin and her collaborators were often accused",The only British woman scientist to win a Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country but she is little known. The only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country but she is little known.,"Dorothy Hodgkin was the first woman to win a Nobel prize in chemistry. Her work proved so brilliant that she was awarded it twice - first for the discovery of DNA in 1951 and again in 1960 - but for the unresolved questions about how DNA works – a subject on which she became known as Dr Dodgkin. In 'Dorothy Hodgkin's Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country', Georgina Ferry writes.","The only British woman scientist to win a Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is little known.","Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel prize. She is also one of only five living Nobel laureates. Yet little of her story is known. The one thing that is known is that in 1960s Britain was in a time of scientific transformation. A young British scientist, Dorothy Hodgkin, founded the British Institute of Cancer Research (BRIC), and set about developing the first successful therapy for the cancerous tumour of the skin. Her work on developing this was described by The Times as 'the most important piece of medical research done in the twentieth century'. However, Hodgkin was hardly the only one to study the skin in a lab. When the first radiotherapy treatment for cancer was developed in the 1920s, the work was largely carried out in the laboratory of Professor Harry Schild, who was a well-known radiologist at the time. The Nobel Prize, however, changed the course of Hodgkin's career. Instead of receiving it for a paper on cancerous skin cells, Hodgkin was awarded an honourary degree. However, this meant that she could not be awarded a prize in recognition of her work. Since 1967 she has been under an embargo. In 1994, when a number of other British researchers were awarded the same prize, a report argued that the British public had lost interest in this woman scientist,","Dorothy Hodgkin (1931–2001) was one of the most outstanding scientists of the 20th century. She showed that light is absorbed by water. She is widely considered to be one of the most important scientists in the UK. In 2003 the University of Birmingham published a book called Dorothy Hodgkin, with the help of two colleagues. As the book shows, she was not only one of the most important scientists of the 20th century, she also helped bring the light of science to the rest of the world. The book was a bestseller in Britain.","Dorothy Hodgkin was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Medicine. She died aged 87 in 1967. Georgina Ferry is the author of a biography of the British chemist who won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1972, whose work led to a better understanding of cancer and led to the discovery of the cancer drug cisplatin."
"Sarah Janson (born 1946) is a painter of the trompe-l'oeil technique. Her paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt. There are a few artists who will not sign their work, unless they are asked to, like Sarah Janson. She is not remotely interested in the concept of the artist as creator, let alone that of the artist as genius. She believes that 'it's not the artist who is important, but the work'. 'It's not the artist who is important, but the work', she states. The title of this interview came from a book about trompe-l'oeil, called Sarah's Spell. In it, Janson writes: 'There can be no artists who are remotely interested in the concept of the artist as creator, let alone that of the artist as genius: It's not the artist who is important, but the work'.

He was only six months old when his father rescued him from a bullfight, where the son had been fighting at full sprint. “He’s a little guy,” he said. But at that moment, Hakan saw the world as an enormous playground. His parents had never performed, not even a song, and were still arguing. “Hakan Hardenberger is a very gifted young man with an impressive pedigree, with the kind of talent that will have him toiling in music halls for the rest of his life,” his mother, Hanna Hardenberger, told the BBC. “He is very gifted,” Hakan’s father said. “He’s very clever,” he said. “So he’s definitely got that talent, which comes through.” Hakan grew up playing the trumpet with his dad. He’s also learned to play a piano, which has proved helpful. He’s learned to play guitar and violin. A few years ago, he discovered the trumpet and became a prodigy.","Hakan Hardenberger had been playing the trumpet for only four years when he decided to study with a coach. He also needed money, so he went to London for a year. He became a member of the Swedish National Orchestra in 1976 and has never looked back since.","A trumpet isn’t just for Christmas...

"A stay at Henlow Grange, Gloucestershire, is like going on holiday in itself. Set in the picturesque countryside, its vast grounds are a haven for nature lovers and exercise enthusiasts. I was introduced to yoga at the time and went to every class available. I am still very sore but feel totally fit and ready for the world back home.

Then she went to her bedroom and wrote 'Lionel, this evening I will not be home again - I shall be off to Rouen.' Charles smiled and said 'Honest!' Emma replied, 'I hope the iced drink was for you.' He said 'Yes. I would be happy to see you again if you wish.' He looked at her. She said 'Yes, of course!' 'Charles,' he said, 'it is hard for me to stay home, as you know.'

"A watch with a radio alarm clock can keep you awake and give you a reason to get out of bed (or sleep in). Stuart Harris of The Daily Telegraph looks at five of the most popular, with the most positive comments coming from the inventor Tom Granger (the first ever alarm clock and an inventor whose company also designed the first computerised acoustic alarm clock). The radio wakes you up with a preset station from a local station. We then tried a snooze function, which allows you to use the radio as the alarm. This works very well as the alarm only goes off after a certain time of the day, rather than at the start of the day. But the snooze works very poorly, so unless you want to get up at the same time every morning, this probably won't work for you. It's also very expensive, which explains why it's not a top seller. The radio can also be turned up very loud for very early morning wake-ups, although this isn't very helpful if you're going to be in bed in the morning. The radio has a very simple layout, and the two main channels are clearly labelled. I've got the Radio 1 set with an extra station, but it really doesn't matter much which one I have as long as I can hear it. (And it also plays music","The 'dual alarm function' that is advertised with this model does not allow you, as I first supposed, to be woken by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed.","Stuart Harris reports Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed.

"I thoroughly enjoyed Hide and Seek by Yvonne Coppard. This young adult novel is beautifully drawn. Emma is a confident young girl, who, in addition to her innate curiosity, is a sensitive and intelligent, but also a very good friend. There is a sense that a lot of that friendship comes from her caring, loyal father, who loves her but doesn't understand why Emma is always a bit naughty. Often times, he takes advantage of the lack of trust that Emma has in her father, but it's clear from the outset that Emma is not just naughty but is trying to escape his love. When she finds her life in danger, it's a dark and compelling read. Coppard does a good job revealing the minutiae of family life, the bonds of childhood friendship and warnings that adults aren't always the protectors they ought to be. A fun and interesting read for kids of all ages, and an example of how well Coppard understands what it is like to be a kid.","Yvonne Coppard is a British author who wrote the book ""Hide and Seek"".

The initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy.,Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination. Best-selling crime writer P. D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase as the headmistress of a girls' school. But it is soon apparent from what she says that the authoritative mien is in fact a cloak for shyness. She reluctantly admits that Adam Dalgliesh the detective in her novels ‘is I suppose modelled on myself - or rather the way I would have turned out if I had been a man’.,"Phyllis Dorothy James was born in 1875 in Liverpool, England. Her early days were spent in boarding schools, teaching English and Greek at Bishopstone School. As her career grew more demanding, her school closed, but she soon found herself teaching history, and became a prolific and successful author. At 19, she wrote her first novel – A Murder at the Hoggarts in 1919 – before moving to Cambridge in 1933 to teach the history department. She has always been a keen amateur detective, and her later novels feature the same kind of devious killers as the detective novels, notably Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

"This month, we will be looking at some of the great British sportswomen currently breaking records and proving they can do it all. As a skiing instructor, Jill has trained hundreds of students at her ski club, and also has her own ski school. In fact, she has four ski school sites. She also uses her skills to train for the slopestyle season and has helped to train young male skiers. Her other sport is cross-country skiing, where she is the national champion. Jill is also the father of a five-year-old boy. Her career started skiing at the age of nine. She went on to compete at the 2012 Olympics. She won the 5000m and 10,000m sprints, and the superathlon in 2014. She says the sport has taught her to put her body and mind to work – and to be patient when it’s hard. Her main focus now is the Winter Olympics in Sochi, where she will compete in biathlon next week.","Great sports Women on a winning streak To excel in any sport is hard enough even for men, but women have to be twice as tough.

"Bringing up badger cubs. I remember my first thought when Derek took me into the shed to hold a very small cub. He was just two weeks old and the rest were tiny. He explained he had taken the cubs into his shed with the intention of bringing them to the vet for treatment. He had taken them in from the fields where they’d been run over by a car and then let them back out into the fields. They’d been left at that but a few months later they had found their way onto the farm and were being fed as part of a programme. The vet said the badger cubs were around three months old. “Each has their own character,” he said. The badgers were soon growing bigger than their little bodies so we introduced them to other large wildlife species such as a fox and an owl. We’d have to put them in big enclosures as we couldn’t bring them into the house with us. We had to put them in an electric fence. When one of the badgers stepped into the electric fence and ran towards us it immediately jerked the fencing down and so we set up a barrier on the ground. Soon a fox had chased it away and it was the badger’s turn to ruffle the fence. We called the vet to pick the cubs up and ","I was delighted when Derek called me to pick them up. With a sigh, he said he would take them off to the farm vet for examination. The vet told me it was an unusually large badger cub and it had been injured in a car accident but it wouldn’t have been fatal. I knew this was the case because it was the only badger cub on the farm that I’d seen in recent years. The vet, Tom, told me all I needed to know. First, his partner, Colin, was the one to have injured the cubs. Colin said that the tyres he had used on the back of the car — before he took them to hospital — could’ve been very dangerous. But they were all fine and the vet said he was surprised at the size and condition of the badgers. That is when he told me the cubs were born in the shed at their mother’s home, just yards away from his dairy farm. This time the badgers were not in the shed, but in their mum’s garden, on her lawn. Unlike the first three cubs, the others were wriggling from the shock of a car accident and had no tails or ears. In the next few days, it became apparent that these young badgers had been living in the shed all day long and as",My husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago so we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box — a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads.,"It had been a busy day for us at the farm and my head was spinning with the thought that it was going to be long before I could get them up, fed and watered, and away from the big cats. But as I climbed onto the farmhouse steps, a feeling of joy and relief filled me. They were badger cubs and we wouldn’t have them for long. We put them out to be fed and watered and then – as quickly as we could get them on to the hayloft — sheltered them from the bad weather. I could see how quickly they’d adjust to the heat and the heat lamp, which had been set in the sunroom. Within an hour they’d joined their mothers in the hayloft. The noise they were making had been coming from the small enclosure and they had to be moved. Soon they had settled, and in two hours they’d been named “Ozzy”, “Peter” and “Nick”. Clearly they had been used to humans, but it was a bit odd when they started doing their own thing. When they first got out, Pete was quieter, but soon started to give us lots of cuddles. Peggy had not been able to get up to them by herself and had only a few minutes to nurse them. After a while she had climbed in and was holding them up","We’d just rescued three cubs from the back of a van in the far reaches of Somerset — a rarity in this part of the country which gets heavy rainfall, heat and snow at an unusually rapid rate. We had brought them up from their mother’s den, and although they threw up a few times they were not going to be eaten by predators for a while, so they’d presumably died in the journey. We knew their mother was safe as it was spring and we hadn’t heard a sound for seven days. When I got back from church I rushed over to the badgers’ den to see how they were doing and noticed the mothers were clearly struggling. I was relieved that they weren’t horsing around with a huge herd and decided to let them stay in the farmyard for a few days. They settled in easily as well, but the older two wanted to stay with their mother. When they grew up, we will hopefully be able to separate them from their mother.","I immediately thought about whether I should try to care for them as I'm not experienced with badgers. In my experience, as long as they are cared for in their enclosure, they will stay with us. But bringing up badgers? Who do you trust with them? What do you want to do with them? This involves deciding whether to put them in a new enclosure or keep them with us. For some animals it may be better to be with them in the new enclosure, with their mother, and for others it may be better to keep them outside with their dad. Derek and I have a rule that no badger will ever leave the area where we culled them. It’s too dangerous. When I put the cubs back into their new enclosure, they would stay with us for three days as a precaution against attacks. Now that they’ve done so much to survive, I’d also like to think that the two of them will eventually bond with one another, to become a whole badger family.","‘So you have three cubs?’ Derek said as I took hold of his arms and pulled the sack out of the box. ‘That is great. Let’s move them to a safer place.’ I held the cubs up in my arms to feel their thin bodies. When I looked at them closer, they each had small dark circles under their eyes – probably fleas. I rushed to give them one more cuddle. ‘You will stay with us until they are strong enough to go out to be alone. It might take a few days for you to get over that,’ I said as I held the cubs in my arms."
"Publisher A: Reviews can or should sell a book. For a broad range of books and on most levels, yes. However, authors may be more oblivious about this. They are more likely to respond to reviews that are good than negative. Book marketing is therefore really much about selling a book in the right way. In that sense it is much less about the reviewer's opinion about a book as such and more about having people buy a book. We haven't yet published a study, so we'll wait to see what happens but you do get the sense of the size of the potential audience of reviewers at the start of every review - with those that are good tending to focus more on a book in their opinion. The impact of negative reviews is less strong. Some readers may have decided they liked a book based on one negative review while others may have remained undecided. Some reviews may be really good and some simply bad. We are happy to see reviewers' experiences as they can be interesting to see. There's something about a really bad review that catches people's attention.",Publisher B I think that reviewers play a very important role in determining the success of a book. The book review in the Daily Mail and the Guardian is often the first part of a newspaper that people turn to. The authors' responses to review are slightly different from publishers. Both are devastated by no reviews but publishers are usually more equable about the had reviews judging that column inches are what matter and that a combination of denunciation and ecstatic praise can actually create sales as readers decide to judge for themselves.,"Publisher B A book is often purchased by the buyer because of a review. As an author, I do not find reviews to be helpful in getting a book published. I have no idea if publishers think reviews make a big difference to a book's sales, but I'm generally satisfied if a book is recommended on a blog by a friend or colleague, and is reviewed by another reviewer. A good review will help to sell a book when it is difficult to attract a review from a book critic, or when I have not marketed a book well enough. The best reviews are those written by people whom I have not published with, who have a good knowledge of the book and its characters, and are genuinely enthusiastic about it. These are rare but the authors who write books whose characters are not well known also tend to receive positive reviews.","Publisher B The quality of a book's reviews is one of the most important factors when it comes to the decision to buy a book, but it is difficult to tell whether a review is helpful or destructive. However, I have come across books that have been influenced positively by negative reviews. Certainly a good deal of the public's knowledge of a book comes from online reviews. Some people read reviews before they read the book and can then make their own mind up about whether it is something they would read. In some books, this leads to a decision being made, but it is more difficult to know whether the book is worth re-reading. Other books have been influenced negatively by reviews and have been re-read. Publisher C A review is crucial to our commercial success. It's something we do to maximise our sales and to make sure the books we publish are as good as possible for our readers. Some book-lovers might be put off a book if the reviews are critical, but others might just think the book is good. Publisher D The author, like the publisher, is affected by reviews more than anyone else. The more positive or critical the review is, the more the sales will increase. The reviews we are most worried about are those that say that the book is not good or not up to standard. However, most book-lovers are a little bit wary of those kind of reviews,","IMHO, reviews don't sell books. You can't get people to buy a book from one review. You need to sell the book yourself.","Do reviews sell books? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said: Publisher A Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. The Book Marketing Council found some years ago that when questioned on why they had bought a particular book, more people cited reviews than any other prompting influence (advertisements, word of mouth bookshop display etc.). Authors' responses to reviews are slightly different from publishers. Both are devastated by no reviews, but publishers are usually more equable about the had reviews, judging that column inches are what matter and that a combination of denunciation and ecstatic praise can actually create sales as readers decide to judge for themselves.","Author B I think reviews are extremely important. Books are reviewed almost daily in the newspapers - for example, in the Guardian, Daily Mail, Telegraph, etc. This is where people see the book's cover (often the first one they see) which can have a dramatic influence on purchase decision making, especially for children's books. I think reviews don't always mean as much for children's books as they do for adult books (for example, 'A boy's life in the wartime trenches' and so on), but it is an important part of my job to get a fair, professional, unbiased review published and, ultimately, the book sold. I think that the reviews are very important for children's books too, however. I think they are equally important for adults and a good review can get sales for both. We have a review for every book that we publish, we have a review for every author we publish. For all books we do review a copy of all our books for bookshops so that they are seen by many readers in a wide range of bookshops and so increase our sales."

"The hull of Tom Cunliffe's yacht, ""The Westerman"", looks like it has aged - but she's not. The hull, launched last June, is a modern evolution of an old design of motoryacht - a small, powerful boat built to explore the Channel. ""I had a couple of prototypes of boats that had been built for the last few years and had proved well,"" says Cunliffe, the co-founder of London-based Boatbuilding Company, Tom Cunliffe. ""For me, design is about being able to meld the old and new of boatbuilding, and that is what is best for a boat. ""I knew the design of a modern, highly-powered powerboat, such as a Volvo Penta, would work well in fresh water and I would think that would work for a big boat that had been built in shallow water."" The idea that the hull of The Westerman would look old but not look ""out of place"" proved difficult, says Cunliffe. ""I had to have a broader view, think about the whole picture of the vessel and what it would look like in the water."" ""That meant I needed to use every available form of technology - from hydrodynamics to navigation systems, from radar to navigation lights - to make this boat as functional as","A designer has created a boat that is a mixture of old and new.

"Hedgehogs Hedgehogs are small mammals characterised by the sharp spines which cover their body. The hedgehog is found in many different parts of the world. None of the hedgehogs are native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. The effectiveness of this as a defence mechanism depends of course on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry extra weight, and consequently they have fewer spines and are thus more likely to attempt to run into their attacker using their ball rolling ability as a last resort.","Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body.

"""We got in there in January and they were still trying to find a name for the building,"" one person told me of the museum, which opened today. And a number of people were less complimentary in their reviews. I went to a preview party for the new Tartan Museum last month and saw the museum from the outside and then went inside. It is not the most attractive building and the layout of the collection is a lot less intuitive than it might seem. It is located opposite a centuries-old building and there is no obvious way that an unfamiliar visitor is going to know where it is. There is an enormous stack of artefacts to see, but the best of them is a small, circular wooden structure. It is a hulking, dark and very different piece of architecture. The only one that I would call impressive. I like the idea of a modern art museum but this was much different. It was very dark, very dark, very dark. It felt like a hospital. It felt like a hospital with a big, cloistered, dark and gloomy room, like you were on the second floor, not the ground floor, as I had feared. The smell in the room was overpowering. In comparison the new museum is pretty tame. ""When I walked into it there was a lot of confusion,"" says one person, ""I don","The new Museum of Scotland is open, and it is beautiful. Despite the stark contrast in design, the Tartan Museum in Edinburgh - designed to coincide with Scotland's national day - is packed with history. Sally Varlow went to see it just before it opened to find out what it was like.","Tartan is Scotland's national symbol and one of the most popular things to see in Scotland. The national museum is set on a corner of Edinburgh's Chambers Street with its huge yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings topped by a hulk of a hanging garden. This unassuming new museum contrasts sharply with its historic location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the Museum of Scotland just before it opened. She was there early in the day, so the exhibits were under wraps, so that it was impossible to appreciate how much the interior had changed. ""It was quite a surprise when I walked in,"" she says.","The new Museum of Scotland has a surprising amount of space, yet it still looks like a giant spaceship. It has been compared to the likes of Burj Khalifa and Buckingham Palace. The building, which was designed by architect Zaha Hadid, was controversial from the start. It was built on the site of an old courthouse, right on the corner of Chambers Street, a street full of historic buildings and an area known as the 'Irish Quarter' which is home to the Royal Scottish Academy. It is a big building, but the most striking thing about it are the whitewashed walls, which contrast sharply with the yellow sandstone tower on which it sits. At first, it was only the outside of the new Museum of Scotland that was unmissable, stuck on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh with its huge yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings topped by a hulk of a hanging garden. Last winter, the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece''stunning') cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. A sculptor and historian, David Hume, took umbrage, telling The Evening Standard: 'This has to be the best building you have ever seen.' That","The new National Museum of Scotland in Scotland's capital is destined to elicit a variety of opinions. And some, such as David Adler of the National Trust for Scotland, are unconvinced. Adler, who has criticised the building's design in numerous publications, has argued that the building's appearance makes it hard to get into, but he says it is a fitting home for the nation's history. Others find it obnoxious and jarring. A few say the museum's buildings can feel a little unnaturally out of place, adding that it lacked a home on its historic site. But a number of critics see its contents as compelling and suggest it may outperform other similar museums in other places, as well as the rest of the country. ""The design is outstanding and the building is stunning,"" said architect Philip Jones. ""There's also an element of surprise and delight here. The museum tells the story of the nation through objects, film, art, archival material, and new technologies."" Some critics, however, find the museum's interior design ""as striking as the building's exterior."" The museum's temporary exhibitions include an installation called the Tartan Garden. The installation was designed by artist John Bell, who is also a senior adviser to Glasgow-based Yarrow McLean Architect","Modernism in Scotland The Modernism in Scotland The Scottish Government has just opened the Museum of Scotland, its new state-of-the-art headquarters in Edinburgh, a modern cheese-wedge building that is in stark contrast to its historic and picturesque setting.","The Scottish government's new national museum faces criticism of its strange appearance and its controversial use of modern materials.

"The British Geological Survey has embarked on a journey to trace the steps astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1706-1742) took to determine magnetic north, while charting his voyages on the warship Paramore. The journey is titled 'Retracing Halley's Voyage' and has been funded by the Royal Society. The project will include a survey of the British Isles, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands East Indies. The British Geological Survey's researcher, Toby Clark, says it was Halley's attempt in his lifetime to use calculations made by an astronomer to chart the 'variations of the compass'. This is now known as 'declination'. Halley claimed to have realised it was caused by the earth's magnetic field, and therefore magnetic north would not always be the same north. It is possible to calculate the declination using a few mathematical techniques. Calculations are relatively straightforward: a number is written on the side of the compass rod and the angle is dependant on the strength of the magnetic field in a particular region. For instance, in the Netherlands, declination is calculated based on the speed of the magnetic pole, so that a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour can produce a declination of 2.5 degrees. By measuring the force of an earth magnetic field, Clark and his team","When the seagoing astrologer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) came on his first schooner in 1607, the ship became known as Paramore. But it was Halley's 1711 voyage of the Paramore that made it one of the most important navigational landmarks in history. Halley mapped the declination of the earth's compass. The degree between magnetic north and true geographical north was known as declination. Halley used his sea voyages to establish the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. For every compass bearing of the seagoing vessel, Halley measured the declination. His records are now kept in a museum in Great Britain and, more recently, at the National Archives in Washington DC. For the project, Toby Clark has been working with colleagues at the British Geological Survey. ""In the early days, ships like Paramore had little guidance,"" Clark said. ""So we use what we have, and use a technique called ""declination drift"". This translates into a drift of magnetic north around the globe. The drift is caused by a change in the magnetic field of the Earth, or, in scientific terms, magnetic dipole. While the exact distance between the pole and declination drift is hard to say, Clark said, there are three main factors to take into account: the distance from the centre of the Earth'","Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is retracing the steps of a 17th century mariner who charted the compass variations.","Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742), astronomer and mathematician, was not the first to discover the difference between true north and magnetic north. His father, Sir Edwin Halley, was an astronomer and the first British king to be astounded by Halley's findings. But in the era before GPS and satellites, he was left completely alone. To find out what he had observed, researchers at the British Geological Survey are working on a project to help solve the mystery. The British government are supporting Clark's quest to find what he has discovered, which is ""suggesting"" that Halley himself might have been on to something if his calculations were correct. For his work, Clark is using data that's 2,000 years old. The British Geological Survey has collected data on compass variations since 1707, when Halley was an officer on the warship Paramore, named after Halley's astrological wife. Clark will find out whether Halley's calculations had any impact on our understanding of true north, and what effects a change in the earth's magnetic field might have on it. ""It turns out that the only thing that makes it different is that the earth's magnetosphere has grown. The Earth's magnetosphere grew more massive when it was struck by the comet, so when it had run away",Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Yet one of his greatest accomplishments in the eyes of his contemporaries was to chart using calculations made on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore the 'variations of the compass'. These variations are now known as 'declination' that is the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north.,Dr Toby Clark is the senior scientist at the British Geological Survey who will go through the sands of the British Isles to find how astronomer Sir Edmund Halley knew.,"The British Geological Survey has been following a track supposedly tracing the voyages of Sir Edmund Halley on his warship Paramore. This is in what researchers are claiming is the first real attempt to trace the trajectory of one of the world's greatest navigators. Sir Edmund Halley, a 16th century astronomer, is best known for his comet, which now flies past Earth every five years. But what makes him a truly remarkable astronomer was that in 1678 he made his first attempt to chart declination, the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north, using calculations made on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. The angle between magnetic north and true geographical north has been measured from the coast of the Continent, and the angle in this way between magnetic north and true geographical north is known as declination. Dr Toby Clark, of the British Geological Survey, is carrying out research at a number of places around the world to try and make the measurements he made on the warship and find out the exact locations that Halley visited, and also the degree of declination that they had. ""Toby has a fantastic amount of experience and his interest in Halley is not limited to the scientific aspects,"" explains Ahuja. He says that to get a better understanding of what Sir Edmund Halley actually did, he has to take"

"My journey to achieve the Seven Summits began late in life. I was 32 when I did them. I knew it was a big goal, but I knew at the time that it took more determination than I thought possible. I made it to Mt. Everest Asia (8848m) in 1998 on a solo climbing expedition with Dougal Haston. The trek began in Lukla, the capital of Kazakhstan. It took us about four weeks to reach the mountain’s summit. The journey was long and not too hard on the body. I remember being totally surrounded by ice and snow, but I got plenty of exercise by ice climbing on my knees. The descent through the frozen mountains was very cold and snowy. The following day, the route to the summit was a much easier one, but the ice was still thick in places and I did not really feel that I was going to make it. At the summit, we all agreed that that was a big achievement, as we’d reached the world’s highest point on each continent. A. Everest Asia (8848m) On the final summit summit day, I found myself standing in the summit meadow. It was magical to me. My head was filled with ideas, and it seemed like a dream came true. I had been dreaming about getting to the top since I was 16, a dream I still enjoy today. B. Mount Everest","Foreword To Seven Up is an interview with Doug Scott, who climbs the Seven Summits. He tells the reader about his journeys to the top of each of the seven peaks, his relationships with the other climbers, his experiences at the summit and the spiritual mystical feelings that he has experienced in doing this.","As we reached the top of Mt. Everest we began a meditative ritual. Dave Clark had been with us since base camp and had told us that he was going to give Dave the bag that we slept in in order to save it being filled with oxygen. When we saw Dave with Daves bag we all fell silent as we felt that something was not right with the way he was sleeping. In the end we agreed that Dave should give the bag to Dave with the idea that it may save it being filled with oxygen. The meditative ritual was carried out in a number of ways. The first was that Dave and I were sitting on the rock and then a large boulder on top of us was pushed over. This rock has a crack and Dave had slipped when the rock broke. After this we decided that we would sit on the boulder. We walked up on the rock and waited for an ice axe to strike us over the ice. The axe made a crack on the rock, and since the ice axe was in contact with the rock we moved the ice axe so that it was pointing in the right direction. We moved the ice axe over the crack and we stood in front of Dave and he leaned into it. After this he took the ice axe, and after a little bit he pulled the ice axe","This is a summary of Doug Scott's story of climbing the seven highest peaks on each continent. He begins with his first attempt on Mt. Everest, his second attempt on Lhotse, and finally his seventh summit, Mt. Kilimanjaro. He was 69 years old at the time.","A. Mt. Everest Asia (8848m) We were in a snow cave 91m below the summit when my climbing partner Dougal Haston began a conversation with Dave Clark our Equipment Officer about the relative merits of various sleeping bags. I thought this was strange as only Dougal and I were present. Putting this down to oxygen deprivation, I then found myself talking to my feet. B. Denali Australasia (9178m) Dougal and I were on the edge of the ice wall in Nepal for two weeks in June. I was climbing the North Ridge and when I saw Dougal climbing, I just shook my head. I looked at him in the eye and said something like a “I think this is nonsense”. He looked up at me and said “Oh! a sleight of hand? Don’t touch my face?” I thought this was bizarre, and we started heading down. On the return trip, we were rescued by Sherpas at about 9,000m. As we began to descend, I asked Dougal how he could feel his feet at such a high altitude. He replied that he was “shivering and shaking so badly” that his feet were numb. He said he felt his feet in his pocket, but when we had recovered he said that they were just resting. C. Denali Austral","One day I am climbing to the summit of Mount Everest. Then I see this enigmatic, white figure and my mind gets fuzzy and my feet say ""Hey! :)"" ; I ask if I should climb any of these peaks because :) ; I find out that these peaks are named after the continents that are found in the Himalaya. They are: America (8963m), Asia (8848m), Europe (9346m), Africa (8944m), South America (8942m) and South America (8943m). ; On the way to Mount Everest I felt like I wanted to climb all the peaks, but my mind got hazy and my body did too. ; I wonder if I could do it as an adventure or maybe as a way to meet the best man in my life. ; I was amazed and speechless when I reached the top of Mount Everest and felt the air rush through my nose, and my body was screaming with so much oxygen. I heard that the mountain was giving out a radio signal and that the next message from the summit would be from a Russian climber who had climbed Mt. Everest. In a way it felt like the message had been delivered, but somehow, I was not expecting it, as I had no idea where I was going. ; ; I decided that","A. Mt.

"When photographing people it is important to understand their perspective and get something interesting out of the shot. This may sound obvious, but people may not be aware that you are watching them. Be aware of their eyes, mouth, and body language. People's expressions can change quickly and for different reasons, depending on the situation and the people involved. Getting an eye-level shot with the right camera can be easier said than done. A good vantage point may be to try to look into the frame and then photograph from behind. The closer your subject is to the camera, the more likely your eye level shot will be. If people are not looking at the camera, the face may be in focus, but not in the right angle. If the subject is very distracting, try to hide them with a distracting object. For example, if you are taking a portrait of someone close up, try to make sure the background is in the foreground. A camera that sits behind the subject may not be able to see the subject's face, and may look even worse than the one in the foreground. 1. Know that they are not posed. 2. Do not pose people who are not engaged in a conversation or activities. 3. Look for small actions. 4. Remind them to smile, laugh, or be pleasant. 5. Be prepared to shoot in low light (around f/8 or less) 6. Avoid pointing the camera","Photographing People People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations, the photographer has to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these. A. GROUPING PEOPLE Avoid straight lines in group shots. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances and if possible on different levels. Otherwise have some of the group sitting or kneeling at the front so that you can see all the faces or raise your own viewpoint.","A. GROUPING PEOPLE Avoid straight lines in group shots. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances and if possible on different levels.

TAKEN AS AN INDIVIDUAL If possible, ask people to stand at different angles and distances so that you can see all the faces or raise your own viewpoint. D. EVENING PEOPLE If possible ask people to stand at different angles and distances so that you can see all the faces or raise your own viewpoint. A person in a sunset or sunset light will appear out of focus in a photograph. You can reduce this effect by having people stand at different angles and distances and if possible on different levels. You can even take photos of people standing with their backs to you instead of facing away from you. E. ACTING IN ACTION People tend to be more expressive when they are in movement. If you photograph people standing still you are likely to make them seem still or pose them","People are the most interesting of all subjects.

LOCKING PEOPLE In portrait shots try to position the subject in the frame so that his or her eyes are level with your own camera so that the face is at the centre of the photograph. To do this position the subject so that the top or bottom of his or her face is not visible and the eye, cheek, forehead and mouth are at eye level with yours, either as a face-on, portrait, or in portraiture. Try to shoot from low-angles or have the subject look at the camera so that the eye is above or below the subject. If this seems difficult, try using a smaller aperture in combination with another lens such as the 28mm or 35mm. The lens should allow for a much wider view of the subject. 2. PERSONALITY IN PEOPLE The facial expressions of people are largely determined by their personality. For example, if a person is a joker you want the viewer to see a sense of humour in the photograph and a sense of enjoyment in the situation being captured. For this reason facial expressions are the subject of most photographs. To create the best portrait of a subject try to show his or her real character. If possible try to photograph people while they are interacting and talking with each other. By observing these interactions you can get a feel of the person and how they are feeling and reacting to you and your","Photographing People People are the most interesting of all subjects.

"As we approach another round of job interviews and personal vetting, handwriting has come a long way. Graphology is a legitimate science, a sliver of the ancient art of finger painting. But it doesn’t seem to be picking up much steam in the United States, where its use seems to be growing. Researching handwriting patterns has been around for centuries and can be used to help doctors with heart problems, diagnose cancer, and predict behavior. The technique can also help predict a person’s personality. In the past couple of years it has become more common for employers to ask for a sample of someone’s handwriting in addition to their resume. It’s not yet clear whether Americans are ready to embrace the era of pen-and-paper assessments, but when it is, it can be a valuable tool. Researchers are looking into how handwriting, or Graphology, can be used for personal guidance, occupational guidance, and even in the context of job interviews. The Journal of Handwriting Analysis, for example, is using handwriting samples to look at job candidates with a range of personality issues and to see what they think of them. Even the National Institute of Health has joined in. In May, a US federal court allowed the use of Graphology in personal counseling and job assessment. However, the US Supreme Court quashed the practice.","The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support.

"The plane's crew made sure they were at the right altitude as the 13 students prepared to enter into a state of weightlessness. Each took a spot at the back of the white tunnel and looked at the ceiling. Then they put their hands in their pockets and rubbed their necks and hands. Each thought briefly about their next move. After about a minute the group split into two groups, some for weightlessness and some to carry out experiments under normal gravity. One group arranged a balloon with a length of thread through it that was tied to a support beam while the other had its end wrapped around its feet. Then the balloon bobbed up and down on a spring and dropped to the floor. The scientists watched them, their eyes getting more and more crinkled as they struggled to keep their balance. They realised that if they tried to lift off from their standing positions, they would immediately fall to the ground. This is something the team had known for years, and was sure they had discovered long before the experiment. They had been trained to tether themselves to each other. The rest of the students were held in a capsule where they would feel nothing. The first group carried out experiments on how a mass can become heavier in the absence of gravity and how gravity could affect the brain when it moves. A colleague helped one of the groups to build a balloon and they were able","The young scientists took a deep breath, held it for a moment, then sat with the tense, limbs stiffened. The pilot said he was sorry for the delay. He had just finished a flight from a nearby airfield. The aircraft had been converted into a weightless experiment where they would use lasers to study the waves of energy the universe is made up of. “We ain’t gonna die,” said the young physicist who was testing the effects of the new technology, using a hammer to knock against the walls of the tunnel. “And you get smacked in the face,” said the chubby American who had been holding the glass of cold water. The scientists were aiming to find out what happens to a body after it has been in the air for a couple of seconds and to what degree the body absorbs the energy. The first wave of energy — known as Newtonian — strikes at just the right moment, and by the end of the experiment they would have collected a wealth of data. “It’s an excellent exercise for teaching people that the force of gravity causes things, but that it doesn’t cause them,” said one scientist. “It’s just one more way of doing things.” “It’s just great to have all that data out there,” said one. “","The 13 students were in the capsule, in their own space, and when the ship reached an altitude of 15,000 feet – the lowest point in the world – they were thrown into a room with no gravity. They had three hours to prove that their theory about the law of gravity was correct or explain why the universe was full of holes. Their experiments had turned out brilliantly. The students had become light years ahead of their fellow researchers. By the end, their scientists would know whether the laws of gravity had been proven correct or wrong, proving that the universe is full of holes.","The scientists had been given a few hours to experiment. They had hoped to use the atmosphere of weightlessness to test their theories. They had been taught that their bodies remained in the gravity of Earth but in weightlessness their bodies became a vacuum. Despite this, a few managed to talk. He said he had learned that weightlessness increases the speed of thought and increases IQ. He said the most surprising thing about the flight was the fact that they had to stay still for up to two hours. Tom Mumford had been travelling with science journalism students for three years to the American University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania, USA, in an effort to help young people take an interest in science. The students would be in weightlessness for up to eight hours, with a half-hour break before returning to Earth. The students are studying how gravity affects our brains. They were in weightlessness for eight hours and will have to stay in the vacuum for eight hours. A computer explains what will happen if they stay in a vacuum for longer than that. As a normal human would, they will fall back into Earth’s gravity and when they rise again, they will feel like they are flying. During this time, gravity acts like a constant refuelling tank. It keeps us from losing energy. It keeps us from wasting calories. The computer explains how gravity affects our nervous system and muscles. It explains","The students’ experiments sounded like a blast from the past.

"The plight of advertising in the doldrums can be traced to the way media and marketing has resisted the whirlwind of accelerated economic change. The fact is that advertisers have failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising’s problems are more fundamental. Instead of seeing consumers as indivisible chunks of the human population, marketers have interpreted them as homogeneous audiences to be targeted and marketed to. The result has been an increase in the number of targeted audiences and, at the same time, a fall in the share of total revenues going to advertising and related media spend. The decline is worldwide and is reflected in the percentage of media-sales dollars in print ads, which are now up 13 percent from 1989 when a recession began to bite. According to a recent report by The Association of National Advertisers, the number of advertising dollars being spent by media in 1990 was 92 percent of total media-sales dollars. At the same time, the percentage of media ads spent on TV ads declined 20 percent. It is no accident that TV ads tend to be more expensive than print ads, but in the interest of conservatism, advertisers seem to have taken the view that mass markets and mass media are the key to success. Yet if you look at the numbers, mass markets are more efficient than individual markets, and individual markets are more focused. As a result, advertising","This story was originally published in ""The New Yorker,"" February 7, 1990. In 1988, the ""global recession"" hit advertising hard and nearly killed it, said Robert Connelly, a managing director of the advertising agency A&E Networks. Yet even though ""advertising was in the doldrums,"" Mr. Connelly believed that ""the problem had less to do with the recession and more to do with advertising's inability to match the pace of economic change."" ""Mass marketing, at least as we understand it, is a way to reach the vast majority of the market,"" he said. But by the 1990s, it was hardly universal. For example, most Americans buy homes with a lot less mortgage money. They don't go on vacations very often. They don't spend any time out in nature. They're not very engaged in sports; they aren't as interested in politics; they don't spend a lot of money on entertainment and other recreational pursuits. They are more likely to shop with credit cards than debit cards."" Eventually, the advertising industry became overwhelmed by the variety of media. It's no longer easy for firms to evaluate the relative effectiveness of all the media that serve their target markets. And then, as the recession hit, it was the media that were hardest hit. The cyclical nature of advertising meant that advertisers used the same budget for","With all the talk of mass marketing, it remains a very popular idea. But in the new world of personalisation, mass marketing hasn't worked so well.","On the other hand, as a result of the explosion of television, radio, and cellular phones, people are more dispersed and people don't buy products from companies they don't know well. In the course of their tumultuous interactions, people prefer to receive advertising from people they feel know their business. People are more selective in their choice of companies, and those companies tend to market in more specific ways, to particular niches. ""It has been a hit and miss for mass marketing,"" says Tom Greenfield, director of the Global Media Institute at the Harvard Business School. ""Because, as the business world has gotten more complicated, it has become difficult for mass markets to satisfy consumers' wants and needs."" And it's true for advertising. If the goal of advertising is to create mass appeal, it's an expensive proposition. Some firms have spent upwards of $200 million on TV ads per year, per market. That's $1.25 per consumer. But when a consumer watches only a few seconds of commercials, the ad probably makes him or her want to buy a product that only a select few will actually buy, says Greenfield. ""There has to be something special about the commercial that would persuade them to buy.""","An advertising campaign featuring a song from the Beatles featuring the words ""If you want to be successful...you've got to be in the pop world"" could hardly fail to appeal to the young, hip, urban youth culture of the 1980s, according to David E. Keen, an advertising critic and author of the book, The New Mass Market: The New Face of the Masses (Penguin, 1991). But the campaign failed to hit an audience who, for many reasons, didn't respond to it. And the age-old problem is being highlighted: the lack of diversity in the mass audience, which includes both young consumers and older, more mature, tech-savvy audiences. ""There is no excuse for not making any effort to reach out to these audiences and [the recession] has only made this worse,"" writes Keen. The failure of advertisers to reach out to these audiences has resulted in their feigned interest in the ""culture"" and thus in losing some market share to non-consumers. The mass market has grown too big, too complex, and the advertising industry is overcomplicated. Its ad agencies, publishers, media buyers, and marketing specialists are constantly searching for new targets. But the mass audience has been so broad that it's difficult to identify even a small number of target markets. The key is the hegemony of the mass market and the lack of","Hit and miss of mass marketing The advertising industry has been struggling to keep up with economic changes for a long time now. That means that it has often marketed to a large number of people, but these campaigns have rarely targeted minority audiences.","The Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. As brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences but they rarely are."
"The Christmas before last I turned 37 and realised that time was running out if I wanted to resurrect a career in journalism - which I believed had been washed down the plug-hole... the technological plug-hole. A quick glance at my curriculum vitae showed that I was shamefully stuck in the 1980s when a piece of carbon wedged in between several sheets of paper in a typewriter was the state of the art. I started on Google Chrome, installed a virtual desktop and set to work. There was no sign of the traditional laptop – I was in the middle of a two-person interview with a colleague, and it didn’t help that we lived in a rural area.

She recounts here how she transformed the family home into an efficient workplace.,"We used to plug in the phone and type up our articles by hand, but technology has radically changed and it is now possible to write and edit articles by the click of a mouse, with a plethora of electronic gadgets at our fingertips. I'd had a long career break since 2000 and after returning from South America I was feeling that I was out of touch with technological developments. I found myself in a bit of a quandary. Having had to leave journalism for a while, I was concerned that I was going to get stranded by the fast pace of technology. I also felt out of touch with how changes in the workplace had affected my working life. My husband works in a construction business and I was able to work from home and the only distraction was my children. I decided to transform our living room into an office, which will now be transformed into a freelance writing room. To do this I had to sell everything I didn't need or use any more and replace it with lots of modern gadgets, as well as cutting down on my electricity bill. In addition to that, I had to install a broadband connection, which will enable me to access the Internet whenever and wherever I need to from anywhere in the world.

But I had to find a way to plug in the home. I had a desk at home, which I made into a desk with computer facilities. I set about organising my space in the best way possible. I bought some comfortable chair to sit in, gave the kitchen an air of sophistication, then built an office desk in the lounge. I also fitted shelves on either side of the room for office equipment and a shelf over the kitchen sink for supplies. I took my books and desk furniture to the carpentry workshops to get them up to scratch. The building works took about five days. We fitted the cupboards with drawers and filing cabinets. It is still a work in progress, but I have been able to turn the desk into a home office. As a result, I can get all my writing done on my laptop in the same time as I can write my email.

"POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER, the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature, as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? How do they get away with it?","When there are peacocks walking their way through the park’s woods, they are not tempted by the food laying eggs from the hens. But there are male peacocks that strut their stuff in a different, more imposing fashion: the strutting peacocks aspire to become kings, and the male peacocks at Whipsnade have, for centuries, sought to become more than a few pecks from a few hens. It was then that Charles Darwin wondered whether there might be something in nature’s evolutionary strategy to help the female peacock become a queen, if she needed a little extra help to achieve this.","Peacocks in the wild are not usually so large. They have a thin, wiry frame and are fairly large birds by the standards of the domestic peacock.",Marion Petrie and her colleagues of the Open University are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try a century after Darwin’s death to settle the matter.,"One would be hard pressed to find a bird in the animal kingdom that would dress as magnificently as the peacock. The story begins, however, with a peacock squawking his displeasure at the hens. A peacock’s squawking is often thought to be related to his sexual aggression - his urge to show off to attract a mate. The bird’s tail feathers are so long that some peacocks have even shown off their sexual dimorphism - which allows both male and female to display their plumage in different colors. Marion Petrie is studying how birds behave in this situation to try to answer Darwin’s famous question, but is unable to find evidence. “We don’t know why it happens or how it varies between individuals. The hens are probably more important to the peacock than he is. They have the ability to judge who is a male and who is a female and if the female peacock shows signs of aggression, she could be forced to choose another male or lose out on breeding opportunity,” Marion Petrie, a zoologist at the Open University, told BBC News. The peacocks were kept in captivity for 15 years while Marion Petrie bred and studied them. Her findings are not conclusive. “The hens","In Darwin’s world a peacock was the ultimate jerk. He thought his little friends might just be being playful when he turned around in his grave. But while peacocks are social butterflies in the pecking order and are found in some of the oldest nature reserves in the world – like Whipsnade – their social organization has long remained a mystery, with some arguing that peacocks spend too much time mowing their grass, others arguing that they should be left to their own devices. What he found to be the best way to test this was to observe peacocks in the semi-wild conditions of Whipsnade. There, the peacocks can’t run up and down trees. The hens just peck away the grass under the peacocks’ noses and head. Peacocks don’t have to hide their plumage. They can walk around the peacock park at their leisure, and the birds there get plenty of sunlight and water. Peacocks, Petrie and her colleagues have found, have adapted to the conditions. They can fly at low speeds, even with wings full of feathers, without losing any height. The hens can keep their tails feathered, and peacocks keep their heads down. The peacocks’ elong","Peacocks do not usually carry long and furious tails, but there are certain conditions when peacocks are in flight that favour the presence of a crest. In the late Spring and early Summer peacocks take up residence at Whipsnade, where they are given food such as chicks and insects in boxes or buckets of water. Then they spread their wings in the mid-summer, and display their magnificent and often disdainful crests as they strut their stuff. It is not only the peacocks’ crests that attract attention in the skies: all birds have a single distinctive feather on the top of their head. The peacock crest has now been voted as one of the 100 Most Beautiful Birds in the World."
"There’s an eerie thing about art—as it is so much a part of our DNA—that it’s just as strange that so few scientists have devoted time to explaining what makes our brains work the way they do. At one time, brain researchers said their work would only answer questions about how the brain works. But today, a group of researchers led by Mark Levitan of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says they might have found a clue. Levitan, who studied the brains of five groups of scientists studying different parts of the brain, says he found two key clues. One was the fact that the brains of those subjects differed in the same way each person’s brain works. That’s because their brains are built differently: each person’s is built for its job. Scientists were working on the idea of a “brain hierarchy” in which the brains of a person at the top, and a person at the bottom, are organized according to the importance of specific tasks. The researchers then sequenced their brains and found a “brain hierarchy” in which both brains made similar decisions about what tasks needed to be done, depending on the priorities of the situation. They found a similar hierarchy with a brain hierarchy for reasoning about which tasks were important and which weren’t, but they couldn’t determine why. In most cases, they","An excellent story with very interesting ideas!

"Nicholas Evans wrote The Horse Whisperer in 2004 to escape the financial ruin of his late-2009 blockbuster, Life and Limb, in which he had worked as a screenwriter and as an aspiring director and director. It was not an easy sell--there were over a hundred thousand copies sold and the final price was $90,000--but it was a bestseller that changed Evans's life. Its sales grew by threefold over the summer, and The Horse Whisperer is one of the biggest-selling books of all time, selling 1.2 million copies in the US alone, and has been translated into over 30 languages. Despite its fame and popularity, The Horse Whisperer does not really follow a traditional story, which is how most films follow the adolescent Jonah Hill, the son of an Italian who wants to join the US Army. In fact, Hill's story doesn't even involve horses at all. The Horse Whisperer isn't so much a film as an homage to the book, and it borrows several things from its storyline: The author is a veteran screenwriter who has produced and directed a number of major Hollywood films, including The Departed and The Good Girl, and it draws on his life experience as a screenwriter and producer. In particular, it's the story of a man who goes about","Nicholas Evans was looking for a reason to write The Horse Whisperer after the film project he had been working on, Life and Limb, collapsed. He felt an urgent sense of emptiness. Nicholas Evans had been unemployed for years, and this was the only way he could earn a living. And then it happened — the opportunity came to write the book. After the first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director, the year began badly when Life and Limb, a film project he had been working on for months, fell through 'almost overnight'. Nicholas Evans' disappointment mixed with stomach-churning worry: it had been two years since he had earned any money and the promise of that film had been the only buffer between him and an increasingly irate bank manager. And now suddenly, out of nowhere, the film project he was working on was a success. The Horse Whisperer became his first book, and the first of many to come, breaking records for books about horses: it sold more than one million copies and racked up £80 million, including the profits from the film. As a first novel it became the hottest book of the year, and before it was published The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, the book became the ","Nicholas Evans was not the first young screenwriter to break into Hollywood with his bestselling novel The Horse Whisperer. However, it was only after years of searching for a job that he began to understand how to use his own strengths as a writer and produce his own films.","This is an excerpt from The Horse Whisperer by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans. A successful first novel that has since been adapted into a motion picture the book has won seven Oscars and has now been sold over 20 million copies in 35 countries. Nicholas is the screenwriter, producer and aspiring director of Life and Limb, the 2003 British biopic about the exploits of John Wayne.","Nicholas Evans has created an extraordinary story in his first book, The Horse Whisperer. In the pages of this first novel Nicholas Evans has recreated a friendship between a wretched saddleman, his nemesis, and an enigmatic oxer, a horse. He has entrusted a new pupil to his care, a young, brightly coloured, and very handsome horse that, along with some remarkable human traits, allows him to befriend this horse, which is more difficult than it sounds. At a distance, this book captures all the machinations and drama of a horse-show, showing the many ways that man can be misunderstood. The Book Description: Beginner Takes All is a novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans. It was first published by Faber and Faber in the United Kingdom in May 2012, and it has been turned into an Academy Award-winning film, with Academy Award-winning director George Clooney as its star. The Horse Whisperer became the best-selling book of the year and is now being sold for over £50m worldwide. What are the reasons behind your success? It was a very difficult book to write, because this was my first book and, as a first time novelist, I had never written a book before.

After a long, hard struggle to make a living as a screenwriter, he now finds himself in need of a new source of income. In May, he receives a job as a writing coach at a state school in Texas. When he first arrived, he was not sure what he wanted to do with his life, but he became instantly enamored with the idea of helping children to become proficient at writing.","Nicholas Evans, screenwriter, producer and aspiring director, had to fight back tears when a film project that he had been working on for months fell through 'almost overnight.' His disappointment, mingled with stomach-churning worry, had been the only buffer between him and an increasingly irate bank manager. So when he read an article in The Horse Whisperer by a British book store employee, Nicholas decided to give it a go. In doing so he found himself in a similar position. The writer was having a hard time coming to terms with the loss of a film project he had been working on for months and, more importantly, he didn't know the name of the film. It had been called Life and Limb, which he had been working on for months. He had not been able to get any financing for it, and there were no guarantees that it would ever happen. At the same time, though, he was still feeling resentful towards the film industry: it had left him with a feeling that there was something wrong with Hollywood. He couldn't give it up. But in his desperate efforts to find the money to pay back the bank, Nicholas learned a surprising bit of truth about the industry. When he contacted the company who had produced Life and Limb, he was told that the director of the film was"

"The ominously named The Thin Red Line is perhaps the most overlooked war film of the last 70 years, but one that still deserves a place in the annals of cinematic history, not least because of the cult following it enjoys on DVD. As a result, much of the critical focus has been on the way the film has been remade on video by a number of directors, including this version of James Jones novel by Andrew Marton. The result is a gripping story of a unit waging a relentless but futile struggle for control of a Japanese-occupied island where nearly 2 000 American and Japanese men were killed. The original, which stars Tom Hanks, John Malkovich and Tom Wilkinson, is at times harrowingly accurate, but also painfully superficial. Thankfully, it contains two stunning sequences showing the bravery of an American soldier and of a Japanese woman on the run from the Japanese. As it turns out, these scenes are the real reason to watch the film - as the two moments in which soldiers are confronted by the Japanese narrator are all that matter. Although The Thin Red Line suffers from a slightly slow pace, the powerful visuals and excellent performances make up for it. A fascinating and well-made war movie, A Abyss is the sort of film you can watch over and",The story is so-so. The actors are so-so. It is a tragic slog. It could have been better.

The soundtrack and special features are excellent, but the film itself isn't very good. C Against All Odds: A thriller set in the 1950s, this is a classic war film. The action is superb and the cast is great, but the direction could be better. It was originally produced as a stage play but never got the theatrical release. Now it's on video in a good-quality transfer that captures the epic battle and the intensity of the era, and the actors are all top notch.

"The era of the newspaper in print may not be over in the next five years, writes Peter Preston. At the moment, all of this is happening in the UK, although the trend towards the demise of the British press seems to be moving in the opposite direction from the rest of the world. According to statistics from the British Newspaper Association, the UK now has the smallest circulation of any other country in the world. The proportion of adult readers aged 18-49 who still read newspapers had not increased since 2007, while that for all of Asia-Pacific dropped from a high of 31% to 22% in the same period. This is a striking contrast with previous figures. In the UK, over half (54%) of those aged under 18 read a newspaper every month, compared with nearly half (41%) among those aged 50 and over.","This is a short story about a journalist who is making the case that the end of print may take some time. Clearly, the digital age is here. But what does this mean for newspapers? Is it a good thing?","The end of print may take some time, according to Peter Preston, the deputy editor at The Observer, a national English language newspaper in London. “It’s one of those things which if you wait long enough the right thing gets done,” he explains, referring to newspaper circulation figures. “It’s probably going to take at least another four years before digital media will be the dominant force in the newspaper industry. And it’s probably going to take another four years before the internet is widely available to all. “The truth is that when you’re talking about media and technology these days, nobody is making a big deal about it,” Preston says, adding that ‘all newspapers are already planning for the end of print’. There is a fear, however, that the end may come too soon. He explains that newspapers’ decision to move to online media was not driven by the advent of digital technology, but by other factors, such as a general distaste for newspaper adverts. “I think that is part of a fear of technology,” he says. “There’s a certain level of reluctance to embrace the online world in certain quarters of the world, but there is a real acceptance among the public that they need the newspaper in print. But it’s not just the press and media that are moving to online platforms – people are switching because they want","The end of print may take some time Peter Preston (Economic Times) Print circulations have dipped, and it looks as though the industry may indeed be heading for the bottom. As a nation, we still buy the newspaper, and it has a special place in our hearts. But print is fading away. It’s not only in the UK, where newspapers are showing signs of becoming obsolete. Around the world, the industry is facing difficulties. On Wednesday the UK’s two largest publishers of newspapers – the Guardian and the New York Times – announced that their print circulations dropped by around a quarter in the past year. This is a shock. A recent survey by ICM Research found that 57 per cent of UK adults believe that print is dying. But according to the research, 58 per cent of them believe that it is unlikely to reach a tipping point in the next decade or so. Newspaper readers have moved online in droves in recent years – and it appears that the trend has been continuing. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail have seen visits to their websites double in the past three years. So it seems that print is losing its grip. But is it all just a matter of time? The Guardian reports that the Telegraph newspaper’s sales were up by 15 per cent last year. At the same time, the Guardian’s online subscribers were up 58 per cent. This is, of course",The end of print may take some time. But surely (you say) it is bound to happen eventually. Everyone knows that print newspaper sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers’ websites keep on soaring. Just look at the latest print circulation figures.,"The end of print may take some time Peter Preston As print newspapers become increasingly inactive or relegated to the digital age, they will be the first to disappear. But publishers will have to restructure to cope with the potential loss of readership.","The end of print may take some time Peter Preston The end of print may take some time Peter Preston The end of print may take some time It seems to many that print newspapers can't afford to lose subscribers, as a growing proportion of print customers prefer the convenience of electronic readers, but newspaper publisher News International says that's an unwise strategy. It points to a slow, but inevitable decline, as print advertisers gradually move to other media, including the internet. News International said its print circulation figures rose by 0.1% in the three months to May (from 1.9% in the previous three months), but its digital circulation grew by 8.4% to 31.16 million, with its website gaining 15.2 million visits in the last three months. It has more than doubled its print subscriber base since last year (to 65.5 million). It is also increasing its online share (from just 1.1% in March 2014 to 12% in March 2016). As the decline in print advertising continues to accelerate, so has the number of newspaper publishers laying off journalists. There is now some fear that the shift will cause job losses across the industry. Newspaper staff are also being forced out or transferred to other media, including TV, radio and the internet. What is worrying is that the shift is not uniformly being made. So even with newspapers losing their majority share of print, there is little sign that readers’ appetite for print will change. Print subscriptions for the latest quarter fell"

The cabinets he has made for friends and family for the past five years are absolutely superb. But as his reputation grows, so does his workload. In fact, one recent order came so well-received, that he had to extend his workshop: 'I've added an office to house my workshop, with access to a phone, computer, laptop and a sewing machine.' Despite his busy lifestyle, he said he feels his income is rising at least as fast as the rate of housebuilding in the capital. 'I get about £22,000 for my cabinets a year, and then I have to build them again.' It's a slow, meticulous process and his biggest challenge is being able to be creative and make something out of every bit of wood he gets. Even the smallest thing he makes is a masterpiece, no matter how small. This week I meet Hurst again and see how he's making a sofa for a man with a disability to use with his cane.

"The Vales’ house is an oasis in the country's rural south, a place where human waste can be turned into green energy and where an eccentric pair live a ‘free’ life. Robert Vale, founder of the Autonomous House, uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles his sewage into garden compost, heats his house with their own body heat, and gets much of his electricity from their car. Robert also says that the most unusual feature of his eco-friendly home is that it's an actual cathedral, not a man-made building. In the chapter house, which sits astride the road that leads to the village shop, a monk kneels in prayer, as the chapter book of the fifteenth-century bible reads. During his two-year project with the Vales, Robert designed and built what they call the ‘autonomous house’.

"Isabel is an art student of 31, a devotee of historical romances and a devotee of comic books. Her wacky and witty personality belies her seriousness of purpose. She is an avid lover of historical fiction and a devotee of Tom Hooper. She is also a little too keen on the late 18th-century romances in particular. Her concern for her knees, which are rather rudimentary by her standards, might ruin her chances. Isabel’s parents, on the other hand, are proud of her and don’t mind her prickly knees; but for some reason, they haven’t been encouraged by her mother’s choice of men. Her desire for a suitor is not met but rather rebuffed by her parents. She then runs into a series of other people and starts to see them as “The Enemy”. However, she quickly realises that the Enemy are also in love with someone else. In particular, one of Isabel’s new friends, a younger man who has just become a teacher at her school and is convinced that Isabel has inherited his son’s love of art and who can make her a more convincing female character.

"When I was a young man, I had a bad childhood, filled with petty problems and my mother putting me through hell every day. My older brother on the other hand, was the one that had the time of his life. He was a musician and a brilliant businessman. He was a little bit of a scamp, and would make a great husband. During my teenage years, he married me. I am very grateful to my father for that. He introduced me to a lot of interesting things. I could not imagine my life without music, even though I was an artist at that time. It has always been my passion. In fact, I could not imagine not being able to sing in front of thousands of people. I have always thought that I might be a musician and not a theatre director. I am immensely proud of my children and I cannot imagine life without them. I could never imagine my life without my work. As a journalist, I used to do everything and I am very proud of that. I feel that I am the most successful person in my family. I would never make a living as a journalist. But I am also very proud that my children have always been brilliant and that I have taught them a lot of things. I am very pleased with myself for this.

The theatre director Because of my bizarre personal life which I cannot be proud of I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute.

"I LOOK AWAY from the cigarettes now and wonder: did I have one to give up and if so, why? Was it so easy? I know it’s hard to be objective about everything, but I suppose I didn’t have to because I’ve never been a smoker. I will try to answer some of your questions in future columns but for now I am happy to take you on an imaginary journey in which you will learn all the things you have to know in order to quit. And you’ll be surprised what you will discover. There are six steps, each with a step-by-step explanation and suggestions for how to implement each one. They are not all presented here to ensure you understand the steps in the right order. But I have tried to provide an overview so you can follow along. 1. You will remember smoking once.: You won’t smoke again when you stop the session. This is how you identify cigarettes as a physical object that you will have to stop smoking. 2. You will want to quit.: You will want to stop. When you stop the session you will feel a bit strange and your mind will go blank. This is the first part where you will imagine that you are not going to smoke again. You will think of what you want to eat and drink and you will remember how cigarettes make you feel. Then you will picture yourself as a non-smoker. You","THINGS CAN CHANGE IN A WEEK There are two basic problems that lead to someone giving up smoking: habit and will power. In an addictive habit such as smoking, the relapse rate is very high. The ability to stop smoking is a very short-term ability to change an undesirable habit and so it is difficult to build habits that last longer than three or four weeks. The relapse rate, by contrast, is very small. So the first thing that smokers do when they want to stop smoking is to cut back on the amount of cigarettes they smoke. As soon as a smoker stops smoking, the urge to smoke may start to reappear, which is why it is so easy for people to start again.","THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be pleased but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. ‘What do you mean?’ she raged. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day lifelong smoker and four hours later I was not was faintly irritating. I find it curious myself. The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. I started to feel ill but the other smokers tried to talk me into staying and that just did not work. My lungs felt a little more relaxed and I felt better in general. I thought everyone would be pleased, and I hoped they would share my excitement. One of my colleagues remarked afterwards that she did not seem to realise how great it felt to stop, so I think my inability to explain it to her might have offended her. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ she queried. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day lifelong smoker and",The Day I Gone Quit Smoking.

"The article’s thesis is that what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure — and this has been the prevailing tenet since the advent of the telegraph and the typing machine, as well as for some of the most successful and influential literary and artistic ventures that come from the humanities. It appears that the writers of great texts are those who work hard at their craft and persevere until the end. The argument that this work is ‘good writing’, i.e. comes hard, is not a new one. Some of the most iconic works of fiction have been created by a handful of writers, notably Emily Dickinson (1844–1914), William Faulkner (1885–1971), and H.G. Wells (1918–2001), many of whose contributions have been included in an anthology, The Letters of Emily Dickinson. Dickinson wrote a short story a week (in the style of the short stories by Hermann Hesse) in which every word was written by hand. He used to read Dickinson and to edit it in his office, where he wrote for hours. When Dickinson’s death in 1849 was announced, he was forced to take to the streets of London. At one point he wrote a poem titled, ‘And I came to New York in the hope and expectation of getting married","Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’.

"I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness; our neighbours the Matzes and the Pritchards and Han Kieffer’s grocery store and the Kring’s and the Pottses’ houses where my first playmates all girls lived. These houses down the street, though not every inhabitant was known by name to me, had each been as distinct in my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street and which punctuated my progress on roller skates or on my scooter.

It said to me, “Are you the one? Are you the one who attacked Jim?” I looked around for my friend the droopy eyed man. He seemed to be nowhere in sight. I crept closer. I saw the back of Jim’s head leaning against the door. I realized that Jim was wearing a long red coat. My brother had only left for school an hour or so earlier so he could not have gone after me. And yet it was hard to think of anything but Jim being the one that came towards me and confronted me. As I drew closer, I realized how long Jim had been lingering behind. As I stepped into the house, the droopy eyed man began to question me. “But you saw his coat hang on the door. Isn’t that why you came out from the house and not over to the mailbox?” “Yes but I wasn’t here.” “So why are you here?” “So you saw me?” He started to point at me. The droopy eyed man looked down at me. I took a step to the side. “What are you doing?” “I’m here, you snuck up behind me!” I looked back at the house. The droopy eyed man said, “You know, you","I saw the little streetlight in front of me and looked up at it with my small finger. I saw in the darkness a shadow with three horns. I smiled as I remembered that evening when I was five years old and was about to give a speech to the neighbourhood children, I told them that I had just bought my first book on children’s writing which would lead me to a new field of study. I paused a moment and looked around. No, I remembered from the beginning. I wanted to know what they were interested in because I’d never seen this side of the street with those houses and this streetlight and I wanted to find out. What is that? I was thinking, I thought to myself, as I peered up at the night sky, the stars were far away from me, but I knew there was a light tumbling through the clouds of rain. As soon as I realized it it fell on the streetlight and it turned to shadow as if someone had flinched. I paused. It was the same dark sky which I had seen all day, but it was a black sky now. I looked back and looked into the darkness. It was a dark, clear night, except for the distant light of a nearby lamppost which had cast a beam which was blazing against the sky. I knew it was that light now, but I didn","I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side.

"Albert Einstein, the great nineteenth-century German physicist and mathematician, was among the first to show that the laws of physics, developed by Albert Newton and Isaac Newton, could be applied to the physical world. After studying the speed of light, he proved Newton and Newton were wrong and made a revolutionary leap forward. After Newton’s work, Einstein had to rework his work so that his theory of gravity could be tested by Newton’s formula for the speed of light, known as the Riemann hypothesis. While Newton’s law was a very successful prediction and led to other successful predictions, Einstein’s theory still has many problems today. One of the problems is that Newton’s laws of motion could only be tested by the experiment of colliding atoms. Since colliding atoms were only made of a solid substance called atoms, they are easily disproven. While Newton’s theory is still being tested, Einstein had a new idea of how collisions would occur. In his work on the Riemann hypothesis, he suggested that if some atoms were not in motion, there would be no collisions or collisions resulting from gravity. Einstein’s new idea could not be tested until he tested a series of objects including two very small, exploding pieces of dynamite, which became known","Einstein Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist and the chances are they’ll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein did except that he developed some mysterious theories under the heading of ‘relativity’ which are famous for being incomprehensible and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience. Einstein was part of a gigantic leap forward in scientific thinking, an intellectual revolution that heralded the birth of twentieth century science. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, more rational description of the universe by studying relationships between matter and the forces of nature.","Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist and the chances are they’ll think of Albert Einstein.

"An astronomer, on his first visit to the Southern Hemisphere, was astonished by what he saw. He shivered at the expanse of the night sky, which included the moon and all the planets, in all their majesty. He took the time to talk to all the strangers about the craters, and in the evenings sipped ale and sipped wine. He sat on the grass at his picnic table and took some notes.","Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results. All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago.","Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century.

"It is difficult to say what sparked the first interest in metals. One possibility is that stone-age people made tools primarily to use stone, perhaps in order to carve stones to make tools or grind stone into grains for the purpose of making other things. Another possibility is that the discovery of metals brought new opportunities for those who were able to work it. Some of the first stone-age toolmakers, especially those who worked axes, hammers, and axe-points, were of mixed ethnicity and migrated across the entire Middle East. Some early toolmakers in the Near East were of the nomadic ethnicity. They were also skilled in hunting and fishing and knew how to work and preserve the meat they killed.",Metals It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals.

"In the meantime, the light on the river was dazzling and I thought that if the light of the setting sun had caught the lilac leaves of the trees to one side in the early morning sunshine, I would have captured the autumnal feeling. But in the early afternoon it was a different story. The light was still strong on the river, but the shadows cast from the trees had been reduced by the shadows of the city above and below. I realised the light was too strong on the river, too much for my liking. I wanted to capture the quiet beauty of the river and the reflection of the city behind it, but I could not. Instead, the shadows of the old buildings, a glimmer in the wind, had shifted around them, and it wasn’t looking promising. The river is a lily pond after all, not a fountain. No one was going to come down to swim here after all, after all.","The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then.

One day one second I might close the shutter on the perfect photograph. There was always the chance, so long as there was film in my camera.

"Irrespective of whether you are a City worker or a City resident, chances are you are in need of air-conditioning at some point during the day.

"I said, ‘Sir, I don’t think we will find the stars’. You looked at me in horror and said, ‘I have no idea’. I laughed, and said, ‘This is what I was telling you about.’ And then I stared at you and said, ‘How is it’. You stared at me with your large blue eyes. I said, ‘I believe it’. But what would you do if you thought I had lied? Why would you lie to me?’ You said, ‘Well it would be very strange if we tried to find the stars if we had done so.’ And so I stayed down there for some time letting my thoughts drift, trying to decipher what the stars were saying. You wondered aloud why I waited for so long to climb out. But I did not know what to say; you sat watching as I told you I had climbed out of the well. In the days of cavemen when all that was required to find a cave man was to climb up and down a series of precarious ladders laden with rocks and mud and sand, it was the only way to discover a cave. So I remained there looking through the clear blue sky. But that’s not really what the stars told us. They told us that they had a telescope just as we had ",You were too scared to look at the stars. 'I am a little scared to get in.' I said. 'But you are only going to look up at the stars when you get out.',"I saw the stars. I could see the moon and all the planets, from this height. We sat on the cliff chatting, you still holding the handle of the bucket. Then the water entered the well and we plunged in. I told you to stand still. You knew that I had been snatching the bucket because you looked too frightened to fall down. But I could not bear the thought of letting you fall. I was still holding the handle. The water flowed down into the bucket. The water was so still that there was no abyss, no sand or mud on the bottom.","THE WELL I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day was clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched eyes wide fist to mouth as I winched up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I had not thought to allow for the bucket’s much increased weight, your lack of strength or inclination to just stand back and let what would happen happen. You held the handle, taking some of the strain as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well’s stone surround.","THE WELL I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day was clear.

"The policeman took three steps back towards the police station. The policeman's face was a bit clouded by tears but then he stood up, still smiling, and walked back to the crime scene.","Ralph turned into the dark street towards the hospital and wondered if the ambulance would be able to find him because his ringing mobile had been loudly beeping. He followed the sound, knocking on the door of the hospital, and heard the emergency alarm activate. He followed the ambulance up to the top of the hill before noticing that the telegraph pole which had rung so loudly as he entered had been pushed up against the wall. The telegraph tower was standing just below the tower and as he walked to the ambulance the telegraph pole had moved up. The hospital had been moved onto a small hill above the road where he was standing.","Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day. When he had first bought the flat he used to come home in an eager questioning mood - often as early as he could — wondering what it had been doing during the hours he had been away. It had represented a form of welcome to him, a region in which his focus was undisputed and reliable. He supposed that he should have worried about intruders or burst drains in that moment of reunion, but his flat had always been sitting waiting for him with an expression of independence or of neglect depending on whether he’d left it tidy or not.","Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.

"Othello The London Transfer of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then, I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I still think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona but I eat my words about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. Indeed, the whole cast is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio’s competitive games with the other young officers get dangerously out of hand and the moment when Iago begins to lose control and has to struggle to get a grip on himself.","The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare’s play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring.

"With a certain humour Keith described it as being like being stranded in a blizzard in a cold wet room at the foot of a snow-capped mountain. Dawne was less amused. 'I'm not sure about you', she said, ""It doesn't feel cold at all, it's warm as a fricking furnace."" Keith was quite irritated by the mention of a blizzard but then again she was not the only one. 'Does that make sense? It doesn't seem likely,' she said. 'The only reason I came up with this is because my Dad had a secret wish to take a skiing holiday.' She also had an idea about what they would be doing during the ski season. Keith had brought her the maps but she never had time to look at them. They were a bit sketchy but she did realise that they were in Switzerland and remembered that the Swiss have a fondness for putting themselves in danger. Keith and Dawne were glad to go up the mountain to look for a snowfield, but as they headed in that direction they were very surprised to find a tunnel - it turned out to be a tunnel for the hotel guests who were a long way off! Keith said that they would have to find someone from the hotel staff to come and","When Keith and Dawne woke up in the morning they found themselves in a snow storm. They looked out the window and saw snow covered trees and mountains swaying gently in the wind. Dawne, who had just come back from school, couldn’t wait to show Keith her passport which he had misplaced. They took it to the hotel receptionist and he said: We had an accident. In Room 212, Keith and I are in a room called the Edelweiss. There are eight people in Room 212 and three of them were our relatives. We have booked this room for 12 nights. We want to spend 12 nights here. We will go to the station and get there by bus and return to England by bus. The other room is on the third floor, it is called the Sky room. There are four beds in the room. The person upstairs, who was sleeping next to us, said that they had not heard anything. They are not Italians.

"Lions are incredibly efficient hunters, thanks to their insatiable appetite, but they also have an insatiable desire to make new friends. Now, the latest research from Harvard, Cornell and University of Toronto shows that lions are no more social than dogs, or even humans. The results are striking. In an experiment involving a large group of captive lions, the team of researchers examined the vocal displays of each individual, trying to identify how vocal group members communicated. It was a close call: A male lion roared three times, as one cat would do when he wanted to scare away potential rivals, yet another lion would roar twice, as one would when you want to scare off a rival. All three lions gave different versions of this behavior, with males, not individuals, demonstrating the more vocal communication and sociality. This suggests that not all cats roar at the same time and that members do not always express their desires as they do when they want to. Lion vocalization is not a monosyllabic sound: lions can roar multiple times. If they are interested in the same item, they do it all at once, while if they are not, the leader can stop the group from doing so. ""This discovery suggests that in social animals, the lions are much less social than previously thought,"" explained the researchers. ""","Two lions are seen working together. They have been spotted together in a circle. They look into each others eyes, then look in the direction of their respective circles. They roar, then they stand still, then they move on. The roaring is heard from behind the lions.","Lions roar to scare off rivals, and in lion packs they hunt like a group. Now we know that most of these roars are not roars from rival lions. These are roars from rival males. In addition, the lions rarely communicate with each other by roars. Their roars are actually squeaks. Rather than being roars from rival males, they are squeaks from lions who have found food together and are protecting their territories. Thus it is clear that males can not communicate with the cubs and even with each other. Whenever they are in danger they will stay put, scavenging food for themselves. But because they are in constant danger, they do not act in a coordinated way. The result is that lion packs seldom hunt for food in groups.","In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals, rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case their next meal. But after spending many years observing these creatures in the wild we have acquired a less exalted view. When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt rear cubs and amongst other things scare off rivals with chorused roars. We have now learned that all the chorused roars seem to be mere ploys for predators to get away with something that is more important to them - a tasty meal.","As far as we could tell, lions roar because they have a vocal system which uses a different approach to communication than other animals. When lions roar they use their own voices and if a lion has a rival who shouts a roar at the same time as another lion then that rival will be forced to give up its territory. But the other lions do not use their own voice at all. They use their own vocal system to scare off rivals or to communicate in certain situations with their own vocalizations. By making the other lions' vocalizations inaudible, the lions are able to attract the attention of an unwary prey.","Observing Lions In the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey.

When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt rear cubs and among other things scare off rivals with chorused roars. We found that the only way lions managed to scare off rivals was to use a ""team roar"" composed of individual roars: Lions never use chorusing as a means of warning off each other; even the best choruses are merely a temporary defense in a fight. Instead, lions seem to depend more on their instincts: they prefer to attack when they have to and even when the prey is too weak to attack without assistance.","Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey.

Instead they don't roar at cubs but the male lions can see them and have the cubs disqualified."
"Dennis Tito is hoping to launch the capsule to Mars by 5 January 2018, but he has a problem – it’s not yet fully ready to use and will need to be refined. It will then fly back to Earth via the same ‘Martian gravity’ to return to Earth. The capsule, named Lunar Express, was designed as a four-person capsule to travel to Mars from Earth and then return home using “Mars gravity”. It will be powered by a battery-powered electric motor. It will be up there about 100km above Mars, making for a very long round trip. It will take two people, two crew members and a pilot. There will be a two-person crew for the first round trip to Mars, but it’s understood a crew of two will be necessary for the second round trip, so it’s not clear who will pilot the capsule. As well as being able to read the Martian landscape, the crew members will also be able to listen to the Martian chants in their cabin. “Mars is a big place. I’m sure there’s going to be some stuff we’ll have to learn, but it’s not going to be like what we have on Earth. Those are not so big questions. I think we can do that. We have a very good crew size. We have a good crew size,” said Tito","Mars will soon become home to the first human mission, if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. Space traveler Dennis Tito has launched a private mission to launch a capsule to Mars on January 5, 2018, which the Los Angeles Times describes as a “remarkable endeavor”. A report on the mission says: “At the onset of its maiden voyage, our craft would have reached the Martian atmosphere and be at its greatest speed, approaching Mars at the speed of light”. Afterwards, the capsule would take the astronauts “almost 160 km above Mars” where, using the gravity of Mars, it would return to Earth without burning up any more fuel.","A multi-millionaire has launched his private mission to Mars, with the pair – known as the Mars One couple – undergoing extensive screening and selection procedures.",Mars needs humans to begin a new era of civilisation and space exploration if billionaire Dennis Tito’s plan to launch a capsule in 2018 actually leads to fruition. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel for fuel efficiency is a priority – the 2018 deadline has been fixed since the next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn’t until 2031.,"Tito’s plan is the only one so far with any hope of landing on Mars since he is waiting for Mars and Earth to align themselves again. He has already funded the construction of a new rocket to carry the capsule to Mars as well as the cost of the crew. The first mission is expected to cost around $100 million, a large sum even by space technology standards. The next Mars mission isn’t expected to cost more than $150 million, as it will be a privately owned spaceship in which a group of Europeans and Japanese are expected. The capsule is backed by a group of billionaires and will include a capsule and a crew of eight. The capsule will take the crew to 160 km above Mars and will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel. Fuel efficiency is a priority because the next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn’t until 2031. Tito said the plans are “adventurous” as well as “soon to be mainstream” news.","Dennis Tito is planning a mission to Mars with his partner Roberto Cavanagh and their 3 year old daughter, Luna. They will travel to Mars from Earth with the help of an unmanned capsule that will be launched on the 5 January 2018, with the aim of returning to Earth without any more fuel.","A multi-millionaire, Dennis Tito, is working hard to launch his capsule on 5 January 2018 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel. He said: “The next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn’t until 2031. ” That means his spacecraft will have to be launched and returned to Earth by 2031. That means the two astronauts will need to be physically and emotionally robust. If the mission goes ahead, Dennis Tito plans to go from Cape Canaveral to Mars by 2030 and then back to Earth by 2031. There are currently 73 human spaceflight programmes and over 1,400 unmanned missions to Mars. Tito says there are around 1,500 people who would be ready to go on the first mission to Mars. He is hoping that the number of people willing to go will rise to 1,000 in the next ten years. Dennis Tito says he has had dozens of people call him to ask him about going on the mission, saying: “I haven’t had any negative responses so far. I’m still deciding.” He says it takes him about a month to choose the ten best people he will choose from. He says that if an astronaut wants to sign up he must tell him he’s willing to go.

"“All households pay for the service out of local taxes,” says economist Mark Robinson. That's a fair description, but not all households are equal. Here's why. The average American family produces almost 12 pounds (4.6 kg) of rubbish each week, about 42% of the average family's entire yearly trash output. But with an average family of four generating 20 pounds (4.9 kg) of rubbish each week, only two households will be paying anything. “The other half of households generate only five pounds (0.16 kg) of rubbish,” says Robinson. The reason is that dumping too much rubbish into landfills (which isn't a big deal by itself) creates environmental problems and costs money. As Robinson notes in his new book, ""When to Do It: An In-depth Analysis of the Benefits, Burdens, and Implications of Commercial Refuse Collection,"" putting a levy on each bag of garbage would reduce the amount of trash being dumped. In this way, residents would reduce their garbage production, which means fewer bags are tossed into landfills, which results in fewer problems, for both society and the environment. For the average family, he calculates, that means at least $6.45 of extra money paid for recycling, and at least $29.20 spent on landfill costs. And on the positive side, the average American family will spend $8,250 less","What if we charged people for each bag of rubbish they produced? It would be environmentally sound and economically sensible. But it would also make it more likely that people would just throw more rubbish into the bins, creating more pollution. What if there was a way to sort waste by materials before it entered the refuse stream? We've got a solution that would solve these problems.","Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. But it may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip. To economists this ceremony is peculiar because, in most places, it is free. Yes, households pay for the service out of local taxes but the family that fills four bins with rubbish each week pays no more than the elderly couple that fills one. The problem is that there are many households that would not be able to afford the service. They may only use it at certain times of the year when it is convenient for them. They could not afford it and had to find a way for a second or third income. It may be possible to charge each family for each bag of rubbish they produce, but it would be more expensive for a single family to dump just one sack of rubbish rather than more. There is no obvious incentive to throw rubbish out because it is free. The free service can be turned into a paid service if people wanted to pay more for it. This can be done either by charging a fee for bags or by raising the tax on the sale of waste goods.","This is a very interesting idea for recycling and reducing environmental pollution. However, it can be very unpopular with many householders. So could this not be done differently? The solution is to charge families for each bag of rubbish they produce, or at least each family that produces four bags per week. This would help with recycling and reduce pollution because the rubbish would be split into smaller pieces and put back together again. Another way this could be done is to limit the number of rubbish bags that can be placed into the recycling bin, if it can be recycled.","Garbage in garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible.

"It is easy for us to focus on our children and the technology we use every day when they are young, when they are absorbing information about the world around them. But what are they really learning? Well, this has become a familiar narrative. A lot of children’s and young people’s early learning will be skewed by their screen time. Whether we like it or not, our children are still developing their brains before we are ready to start thinking about what they are learning on a more permanent level. For this reason, we need to stop the endless, mind-numbing repetition of screens for learning. It’s good practice to put learning down into practice. Let’s stop thinking about screens as if they’re the answer to every learning problem. Instead, let’s talk about how to get children interested in learning and teach them on a meaningful and lasting basis. It’s a subject that has been the subject of much controversy. But it isn’t just about learning about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. It’s also about how to teach kids to become aware of other kinds of information, such as weather conditions, plants, animals and so on. We need to be talking about how to find out about things – to ask, “Is there snow in Australia?”, “What are the differences between sand in the desert?” “How do ants look?”, “","Screen learning can be very useful for learning. But there are some risks. It may reduce the depth of understanding in the young child, he may learn less in one session than in a few. There may be a danger of being distracted. Several children have been harmed when they have learned online. Another parent has been accused of inappropriately educating their children.","This article is about screen learning. There is no evidence to suggest that it is a good method, and the writer’s argument that this was the case is largely wrong. Screen learning requires little concentration, a lot of eye-tracking and often little interaction with other people. It also fails to involve the development of new skills, such as concentration.","I am surprised to find that your son didn’t remember much about dinosaurs. So it is best to put them to bed and to return to the familiar. For most children, it is better to talk and re-tell the stories that you read to them. For me it is better to go to the movies with them rather than reading them to them.","Screen learning is a modern phenomenon. The Internet and computer programmes now account for more of children’s learning than all other educational materials combined. The problem is that children learn in different ways. Some prefer to hear or read; others are more interested in seeing pictures. When they do read, they need to comprehend the text because it’s in a language that they can understand. That means that when they are watching TV, they have to learn the language of the programme, with all its visuals. This type of learning is often a bit immature, and children’s minds are not yet fully formed. However, there is still a place for screen learning. It’s part of a wide-ranging attempt to teach children about the world, so it’s better than nothing. In this case, what happened was that the child learned the words to a song, but didn’t understand how to use them. There was no need to be able to read the words. The child was able to make up a story by talking about things he’d seen online. This type of learning is often referred to as rote learning, which has the effect that children often need to re-learn their knowledge. One thing I did like about screen learning with my son was that he was interested in learning as I spoke. By saying the words he’d just learned as he went along, ",Screen Learning A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. ‘I’m a little dinosaur’ he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was not much. There is a modish rush to embrace internet and computer learning but is learning via a screen a good method? One writer tells how he tried out an interactive programme with his son.

"The Bambu Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, buys you a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. “What made you want to run this course was that the design process consists of a computer modelling of how the bike will sit and ride and then a CNC-cut prototype frame that is built up in the workshop. The CNC machine builds the frame out of solid bamboo and is operated by one of the engineers,” Marr says. That process is done in a small room set up in a former paint shop in Hackney Wick, east London. The two engineers – James Marr and Ian McMillan – had done extensive research in the sustainable manufacturing of bamboo frames and decided the best way to ensure they were cost effective was to enlist the help of others in the bicycle industry. So, they contacted a number of industry-leading computer designers and made their designs available for free to anyone interested in making their own frame. This is how the Bambu bikes were born. Marr and McMillan designed the frame with their partners, and took advantage of the opportunities offered by the raw bamboo. Each member of the frame is also able to choose a colour from a range of ten. They can also mix their own colours using the Bambu colours, and add a variety of other options.","The Bamboo Bike Club runs an experimental, computer-designed bike-building course in Hackney Wick, east London. Students start with a pre-designed bike frame using a computer software, then turn it into a hand-made bike after being guided by two engineers who teach the class about bamboo and the engineering that goes into making it. A bike's frame is one of the first things to be made; the bike's parts include a frame fork, handlebars and seatpost. A computer designed frame can be made using any material, a bamboo bicycle frame, for example, would not be the same as a titanium bike frame. James Marr, who started the workshop, runs it together with Ian McMillan, an engineer from the University of Bristol, who makes and sells bespoke bicycle frames. The pair say that there is a growing trend for cyclists who ride bikes to get to work and commute to work or for leisure, for instance, because it is good for the environment, good for health and better for the health of others. As a bike is made from a piece of material based on a template, the final part must be made by hand, which is where it gets its name. The workshop is a mix of workshops and classrooms, with some people working on their own bikes and others being guided. Some students build their own bikes, while others choose to take a course","The ride isn’t pretty, but it’s the only way of seeing Hackney Wick – a sprawling industrial estate in east London that’s home to the most innovative bicycle workshop in the country. The bike-building school is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. The nascent bike-building school was born out of a dream forged by the pair over two decades ago to build high-end bicycle frames made from bamboo, an eco-friendly and largely renewable material. It was conceived after seeing a similar workshop run at Bicycleworks, an engineering firm based in north-west London. “There’s a lot of opportunity for us in Britain,” Mr Marr told a BBC team in December. But the club has had its share of drawbacks. The company struggled to find the right location, and the bikes built by the group aren’t very good. They’re not very good, either. A bicycle should be more like a car, with the frame sitting between the wheels and the road. But even after one year, the bikes are still wobbly. “The bikes squeak and they’re noisy, too,” says the owner of one workshop. This is no ordinary bike building course, however. It takes place over two weekends, and the only thing you get for your money is the frame and a weekend of","A bike with an engine powered by solar cells is just one of the items on the bike-building course at Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan in Hackney Wick.","The bamboo bike is a renewable resource that requires little maintenance. There are more than 40 million bamboo stalks in Asia and the Americas combined, making it one of nature’s most sustainable materials. But there has been little in the way of bamboo bicycles in the UK, where it has previously been unavailable. Engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan have set up the Bamboo Bike Club in Hackney Wick to help bike-enthusiasts – both novices and pros – turn their hands to building a bike from scratch. They spend two weekends in Hackney, creating a computer-designed frame and teaching how to ride. They sell the frames, which are made of carbon-reinforced bamboo, and teach a two-part bike-building course that culminates with a ride to the coast. The final price is £750 for the frame, with the workshop open to members only, and the cost of materials. To pay the fees, members get the frame, as well as a two-day workshop and a two-course dinner.","A computer design of a bike with integrated lights, baskets, saddle, handlebars and mudguards is created using three dimensional CAD software. For £400 you get a computer-designed custom frame, plus a fun weekend of bike-building.","Two engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan say they want to turn their workshop in Hackney Wick into the UK’s first bicycle factory and a fun weekend of bike-building. There’s excitement too because the bikes will be made by hand. James takes me round the workshops, showing me various machines, and you can try out some of their bikes. You’ll be building a custom frame from scratch by hand, and will get to choose the bamboo that goes into it. It’s a nice contrast to the computer models used by a lot of bike-builders, who are mostly made from steel or aluminium. As I watch James he has an idea for a bike I might like. “We’d all like to build a really fast bike,” he says. The bikes are computer-designed, so your bike will be different. The frames are made from a high-quality bamboo that’s cut in to a thin strips by hand. James says it’s as if you’re making your own violin. Each frame costs 900 pounds ($1,600), but the bikes are so much fun to build that the cost of the bike would be low and you can have a blast with the bike. The builders tell me that the frames are lightweight and easy to fold, and the course lasts two and a half days. I’ve been able to watch most of the workshop"
"The strange male realised he had been duped and fled, and as a result the group had to get used to not having a rival.","The vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees.

"Sand Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete, I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me, sand is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it adheres to you like ‘stucco' and cannot be shifted even with a fireman’s hose. But and here’s the strange thing — the moment you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet, it pours off you. Sand tends to stick to our bodies when wet, but there is a different type of sand that is soluble in water and does not adhere when wet. It is water-soluble, and is found naturally in the ocean. When the water evaporates from the sand, the dissolved water is drawn to the surface and evaporated. Unlike sand, this water-soluble sand is less likely to stick to you.","Sand Much as I admire sand’s miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete, I am not a great fan of it in its natural state.

"American Visions is a very disappointing series, but it is not the only one. The other series to make a bad impression is ITV’s British Art. At the moment ITV has taken on the challenge of making art available to those who can only view it through a DVD. The British Art website has an enticing programme called In Search of an Artist. This series is set up to take you through a variety of artists, some well known and some little known. You can watch a selection of episodes in the archive on the ITV website. This programme, commissioned by BBC, also makes an excellent introduction to the idea of viewing art in a virtual way. For me this is a very good idea, it should give people an opportunity to see work in a way that is accessible and not just restricted to the physical world. However, there is also a danger of simply looking at artworks and having a look at them. After watching all eight episodes it is a real treat to see a sculpture, or a painting or an installation in its natural environment. In other words we get a lot of the effect, but what is so great about the real world is that it is a very different world and much to admire. The programme also highlights how the art business has changed from art centres with walls of paintings and sculptures to business centres with large amounts of money invested and people who come along",Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts?

"To all you fans of the actor, the craft is simply a set of rules you play by: When an actor is on stage, he or she has to know how to play by those rules and not the other way around. The rules are like arrows in a bow. They pierce the soul of the character and drive it into the wall of the audience, which in turn drives them into the wall of their head and out of the audience, which is an exercise in futility. The actor who is always trying to break the rules is always trying to get at the soul of the character and not the soul of the character. It is hard to break the rules on the stage, but only the actor with a brain can break them. That’s why we see “Hallelujah!” when an actor smashes the “Bridge of Spies” in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. When people talk about acting and talk about the craft, many of them just want to prove their mettle, so they don’t have to do anything and can focus all of their energy on the craft and the characters. This is exactly what they do. The first part is the hardest: a good actor tries to go beyond what is expected of him or her. If it’s not a good enough performance, the performance isn’t good enough. The second part is the easiest. The first",The Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time.

"As we enter the twenty-first century, there is an urgent need to rethink the nature of work and the way it affects us as people. The problem, says Theodore Zeldin, is that we have lost the ability to question how our jobs shape us and why they change us. We work out of fear, not of what is to come but because we fear the future. It is as if we are ignoring the fundamental questions of human nature by settling for short-term solutions - and then regretting that decision when a better solution emerges. ""Success in a career no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued and understood and even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame,"" he writes. The writer is co-author of a book, ""Warrior's Creed"". As well as writing, he co-directs The Good Life Project and an education program at the National Association of Colleges and Employers in Seattle.","Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued and understood and even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame. Loving your work until recently was enough to make you a member of an envied minority. But now you have to ask yourself what your job is doing to you as a person, to your mind, character and relationships. This question is crucial.","Will we be satisfied with our lives if we do not take a little time out of our day jobs to read books, read novels, watch TV, etc? We are no longer content in our comfortable homes. We need stimulation, freedom of choice and stimulation to keep ourselves active and young. Is the job you are in doing something that will bring you satisfaction and fulfilment? Have you achieved any of these things? If so, then you are not happy. Sadly, the world of work is not the same as it was when Theodore Zeldin was a young man. He is now 60 and looking back at the working life he had at the time. Theodore Zeldin believes that the working life of his generation could easily be radically different. He wonders whether the problem is our increasing reliance on machine technologies and the fact that the working life of most people has become more competitive. He questions whether our working life is really worthwhile and whether we can have more leisure time. Can we actually find time to read books and play sport? How much time do we have to spend with friends and family? Is it possible to have time to write? Does having time to read have a positive impact on our health, wellbeing and mental health? Is the feeling of achievement that comes with doing a good job enough to make us happy? The answer to these questions is not always easy to answer. Most people are satisfied with their","Work Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change. Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough.

"There are about 400,000 words in our language, roughly one word for every letter in the alphabet. As you may or may not know, these words are not actually words. In fact, they are made up of a combination of phonological patterns. In the language that you and I use, when we speak, the sounds of the English language are like a musical symphony: they can make a brain in your brain vibrate like a violin or a violin string, or like a chimpanzee’s heart beat when it hears its name. In the other language we use, when we speak, the words we use can make sounds like a rat’s snarl when it hears its name. In the language that we use, when we hear, the words can make sounds like a dog’s bark or the sounds made by a kitten. A word that has several phonological patterns and many of the sounds of other languages has one single phonological pattern and one single phoneme, which is the same as the phonemes of the German language. The number of different phonemes in the language of language is called morphology. There are 20 major morphologies that make up the language that we use.

"Kinetic Art Rejoice is a brilliantly small and unassuming exhibition at London’s Hayward Gallery. It’s the most interesting, unusual and delightfully eccentric investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. Rather than the huge-budget mega-hyped multi-media spectacle that so many museums are turning their backs on, this one has a clear point, a point you won’t be able to ignore. It’s well-presented, thoughtfully organised and a joy to wander through. It has a strong sense of place and is easily accessible for all. It’s an event I recommend if you’re in the capital, or if you’ve ever wondered what ‘kinetic’ or ‘eclectic’ art is.","""Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder."" A new exhibition at the Hayward Gallery traces the history of kinetic art, that is art which is concerned with movement. In the process, it reveals that making artworks which either move by themselves or investigate the idea of movement in some way has been a consistent but largely unrecognised theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. Almost every exhibition I’ve been to, either as curator or collector, has been concerned with the kinetic arts, i.e. the movement of objects. And I’ve never been so excited to see a room full of interesting and exciting works of kinetic art. The exhibition starts with a long introductory lecture focusing on the history of the movement in art. It includes more than 40 artists including John Bellamy, Ray Bradbury, Willem de Kooning, and Charles Ray. The lecture includes information about their work, including the significance of movement, and how it changed art. One of the highlights of the lecture is a piece which uses a hammer to smash a vase against the wall. The art itself is rather striking, with a bold red abstract work by Paul Gauguin, as well as pieces by Alberto Giacometti, Ernst Ludwig","A new exhibition has taken over a London gallery and turned it into a place full of wonder. Taking visitors on a journey through the history of kinetic art, the new show starts with the invention of the clock and goes on to show how kinetic art is a central theme in the work of many of the leading artists in the field. By tracing the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — the exhibition reveals that making artworks which either move by themselves or investigate the idea of movement in some way has been a consistent, if largely unrecognised, theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. One remark: “It is a little like tinkering with a broken clock - you don’t do it perfectly - but the kinetic movement is interesting.” I love it when I get to see my favourite work, especially one that had me baffled and smiling in front of it. I think the most astonishing of all is 'The Clock Movement', which is basically a giant clock that has been moved by its owner. But then there are a whole host of other pieces — some very clever and quite beautiful. I especially enjoyed 'The Moon Walk' which involves two'snakes' with magnets attached which move one at a time, so that they","Kinetic Art traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century. It starts with the work of Alberto Giacometti in 1931, when he exhibited a sculpture known as the ‘Mother and Child’. Giacometti was an Italian-born artist who worked in oil, the same medium as the other kinetic artists, such as the Russian-born artist László Moholy-Nagy and the German-born artist Anselm Kiefer. They created sculptures such as the ‘Wave’, and the ‘Crystal’, both of which are presented in the exhibition. Other artists who work in kinetic art include the Austrian-born artist Josef Albers, whose ‘Cycles’ is an enormously complex work in which hundreds of wooden discs – mounted on a rotating plinth – generates a dance of sounds in the gallery’s vast room. Some of these kinetic works seem designed to be enjoyed by both the viewer and the viewer’s pet cat: a glass of wine slowly swings upwards, a cat leaps in response, and a tiger is chased by a tiger as it chases it in an open air room. But others are more subtle: works by the German-born artist Karl","Kinetic Art, a new exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London, has uncovered many wonderful and rare works of kinetic art that are now showing to great interest. Rather than focusing on how kinetic art has been made, as some exhibitions do, it instead focuses on why it has been so popular and why it has continued to be so popular, and why it will continue to be popular into the future. This is a great article for any language learner.","After the success of the new exhibition that explores the history of kinetic art, the Hayward Gallery has now reopened after a significant renovation. The museum is now known for its wonderful collections, but one aspect of its new look was the restoration of a small but important kinetic art gallery. Located at 7 King’s Road, near Hyde Park, the gallery’s name was changed to Kinetic Art in a sign of the hope it had for the future of the space it had been housed in for several years. The new kinetic art exhibition is the first time the Hayward Gallery has had its very own kinetic art gallery for many years. It is a rare opportunity to see such an extensive collection of kinetic art all in one place. It also combines an in-depth analysis of the kinetic art movement in a fascinating way. The new space, a former garage and one formerly used for a church, contains many of the best pieces, like the large ‘Castle in the Air’ made in the 1960s. This is the perfect place to watch the moving, intricately designed and incredibly complex piece. It is an exhibition of kinetic art that is not only an exciting display, but one that tells the story of kinetic art itself in a way that is both beautiful and thoughtful.",Kinetic Art Rejoice — the well-nigh impossible has happened: London’s austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder.

"After the success of their breakout album “Stone Cold” in 1956, Paul Simon and Ringo Starr had their first recording session with producer Jack White, who was responsible for both the psychedelic rock of Pink Floyd’s “Under Pressure” and the lilting folky melodies of The Rolling Stones’ “Chain Reaction.” When Simon became more aware of White’s role in producing the album, he turned to Freed, who was promoting the album with a full-band session. After his first session, Simon began recording songs with White, and began playing them on Moondog with White, starting with a cover of Little Richard’s “Seasons of Love.” When Freed asked Simon to sing “Little Girls” to a recording of the Beatles’ “On the Road Again,” Simon agreed to do so. He added a line on the cover that read, “If the Beatles ate every word, then the Beatles ate me.” For White, the song represented a call-back to his earlier hits, a sentiment that resonated with Simon. “It feels like my parents took over the radio station after me,” Simon wrote. But White, who would go on to produce his next two albums, had just left Moondog. Simon was already planning his first recording session, which took place in June of 1956. While he was listening to","Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult, but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged.

For Paul Simon as for other youngsters in the US, the chief opportunity for hearing this new and invigorating type of music that was sweeping the country was courtesy of Alan Freed’s radio show Moondog Rock’n’Roll Party.","For Paul Simon, as for other youngsters in the US, the chief opportunity for hearing this new and invigorating type of music that was sweeping the country was courtesy of Alan Freed’s radio show Moondog Rock’n’Roll Party.","Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged.

"It’s been a fun last couple of weeks. I thought I would share a photo of a couple I’ve been seeing in the blogosphere, as well as a photo that I took at a recent party in Toronto, where I took a lot of photos of my fellow bloggers in the #bloggersphere. I also wanted to share a picture that I took of my friend (that I’m not really sure of the name) from a local restaurant. Not a photo of a restaurant where we’ve had lunch, it’s just a picture of her and me with food – we had a nice lunch together when we were at the same restaurant. That’s not all: my friend is also the co-owner of the restaurant next to where we ate, and we also worked with her to create a logo for the restaurant. You’d never know unless we showed you. On our social media platforms, some things are private, and there are a lot of things I can’t share. On Facebook, for example, my Facebook friend list has only a couple of friends, but I’m still posting there, so we might as well be friends.

"Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting. Not so. Just by throwing a few roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery and a few herbs into water you will get the most delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a tin. Instead of buying an over-sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives emulsifiers and additives, in five minutes you can turn out the most delicious confection that both grown-ups and children will love.","Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food.

"We are presented with a series of hypothetical situations involving two types of chef. You have a kitchen at work. You have a kitchen at home. You have a kitchen at home and a kitchen at work. You also have a kitchen at home and a kitchen at work. You go to work on a busy day and you get your homework done. You have a kitchen at home and your dishes are delicious. However, if you look at each scenario, you would find that in each situation, the kitchen is either far more or far less efficient. We can use the following hypotheticals as a basis for our analysis: (1) If your job is fast-paced and you have a lot of responsibility, your work time is a lot longer. However, if your job is mundane, you are wasting time doing dull work. (2) If you are a busy chef working in a restaurant, you are not doing much cooking. (3) If you are a busy chef working in a restaurant and you can do more cooking than your colleagues, your work will be much faster. (4) As a busy chef, you work well under pressure.

"I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room, an oasis of cultural sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class. Here was the largest collection of records I had ever seen the first stereo record player and tuner I had ever come across and the astonishing evidence that a teenager existed who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses pictures and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. The record player sounded a bit unrefined, although it was a good stereo unit, and his tuner was clearly in need of servicing. The wine glasses appeared too fragile for an 18-year-old’s discerning palate, though there were wine glasses with other designs on the stems. The only other evidence I saw of a teenager spending money on art and antiques was a series of pictures of classical music in oil paintings. And the wine glasses showed that his father was a collector of fine art. TIM RICE As he opened the fridge he began to pour himself a glass. He then poured himself another. Then another. The next glass he poured himself another. Then another. Then another. The next glass was very good but not excellent. Then another","Andrew Lloyd Webber has spent a fortune on clothes, furniture and records. What is the first thing that pops into your head about him? It’s not a lot, unless you consider that the collection consists of albums, LPs, singles, compilations, and compilation albums that have been remastered by others. What I find really astonishing is that he was able to afford such purchases when he was at school. The only other thing is that there are more discs than records. The fact that it has been this way for so long is a sign of something. His parents, at home and in school, were indolent.",TIM RICE The young man shook his head sadly. It was very obvious that he had no intention of getting serious. His room looked nothing like a man who was about to hit the big time. It was quite evident that he did not plan on going through with it. It seemed quite obvious he did not have the money to buy the things he had said that he did. This he had proved at every turn. He had got a job that he liked doing and the money he needed to do it. The only thing he did not do was work for the council. His house seemed to be a mess. He had been on the streets looking for work but had not got anywhere. But he had done an excellent job of saving money – and the credit card was working. He was very proud of this. I thought it was quite an achievement for a teenager to have saved that much money. He could barely afford to buy a drink but could afford to spend hundreds of pounds on Georgian wine glasses and furniture. I thought it would be a good idea to write him a letter and ask him what his plans were for the future. He told me that the children were too young to see much of what was going on and that the house was in terrible shape. But what he told me left me in no doubt. He was making money. He had decided it was time for,"Tim Rice went with the family into the kitchen. It seemed as if they were all on drugs. But before the family got there he looked out his kitchen window, and saw a cigarette end in the air. He guessed what it was, a cigarette dipped in cocaine. He put the cigarette end into the ashtray he had left out for Mr Webber before he left for work. He snorted, but Mr Webber thought he was drunk, so he poured him a glass of water instead.","TIM RICE I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room, an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated.

Today he plays Lord Byron in the musical Les Miserables and is a successful writer and composer of stage musicals. He is the youngest of seven brothers. His father was well known at the theatre and, on that particular afternoon, was credited with giving a start to the musical revival in Britain. My father would certainly have been proud of his son. He told me that when he was younger he had often been influenced by his mother, whose talents he still admired. His uncle was very well known for being a famous astrologer and the family would often go to the observatory together to watch the astronomers. His mother’s first love was opera and she was also an acclaimed actress. Her husband, Sir Thomas, was very much a sportsman and was one of the most successful astrologers and cricketers of all times. However, he suffered from paranoia and this affected his performances. My father was also extremely proud of his son and although he told me the truth it had caused some concern among his friends. He would never have spoken of his son without his mother’s approval.

"Advertising on trial Advertisers argue that the UK government’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has misled consumers into believing that they were protected by copyright by censoring and scrutinising advertisements for the first time in the agency’s history. The ASA claimed that the government was being unfair when it refused to sanction agencies for misleading consumers about the safety of a product and if they did so were responsible for the poor performance of some of their own agencies. The court was told that all such claims were false because the ads did not comply with the code and the agency did not carry out any work which, as it put it, was “too controversial or inflammatory”. The court decided that the government’s claim was without foundation and dismissed it without costs. The case was heard at the High Court in London on 26 January 1992.","If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic, hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. In Britain it meant in 1991 alone that while gross domestic product (GDP) declined, interest rates remained punitive high, consumer spending on almost everything other than staples fell more than half a million people lost their jobs and some 75000 homes were repossessed. Now, a little over two years later, we finally see how the recession has affected advertising in Britain. For years, companies across all industries had suffered from the economic downturn. Nevertheless, the sector continued to work if you look at the way ads were distributed to the public. In the early years of the recession, however, many advertisers had chosen to stop trying to generate revenue through advertising, either by cutting staff or by spending money in other areas. For instance, even in the late 1980s, advertising had often been used to generate revenue for newspapers. In the 1970s, newspapers were not considered to be a viable source of advertising revenue, so, when newspapers began to cut advertising, fewer and fewer newspapers started using this business model as a new source of revenue. The result was that even when the economy was in recovery, newspaper advertising continued","Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life.

By the early 1990s all of the big names in advertising had gone through a major revamp. As the recession eased so too did the size and scope of advertising agencies. There were, though, some exceptions to the pattern. British advertisers still clung to some of their more traditional techniques such as billboards and telemarketing but they have also become more innovative and experiment with new approaches. These changes are often seen as part of a move towards new thinking or a return to the old ways of advertising. And there were, even among the advertising veterans in the late 1990s, some examples of the new thinking.","Advertising on trial It was a bitter time for the advertising industry. At the time some of the industry leaders were making a big fuss about the fact that many companies were cutting costs to make a profit. That was understandable of course since no one could know how long it would last and how much more severe it would get. At the same time the economic situation did not make it any easier to attract the attention of potential clients. There was a tendency for many of them to become tetchy at the thought of advertising their products in such a tough economic climate. Yet even if clients weren't necessarily making the kind of decisions that would lead to a recession it meant that advertising would have to go on. As a consequence many large, established, well-funded agencies in Britain made a concerted effort to keep clients, and themselves, happy by finding ways to attract new clients. They took a number of unusual measures aimed at easing the pressure on clients to stick to rigid budgets, such as restricting spending on staff training and re-orienting their focus to new markets. Rather than trying to do their best to win clients and create a profit, they were putting themselves on the defensive to secure their existing work. They reduced staff levels, reduced overheads, decreased salaries and even cut the salaries of their employees who were already stretched. In effect they had made themselves into ""agencies of survival","A new strategy had been devised to make advertising more competitive in times of economic crisis. That strategy was the use of television commercials to drive footfall into brands such as the British Heart Foundation (BHF). At the time, the BHF had a budget of £150 million (about $150 million today), and their advertising expenditure over three years averaged about £1.25 million a week. This advertising cost, however, was not unusual compared to the cost of other forms of advertising in the early 1990s. In a country as engulfed in a worldwide recession it would have cost £300 million today to run the same television advertising campaign. Until then, BHF was the largest advertising agency in the UK, but it lost half of its business when the recession hit. At that time, BBC Radio 4 was relegated to only 5th place in the UK charts. For example, in 1990, British Airways, the world's largest airline, retreated to its lowest position on the chart at number 10 in 1992. Similarly, the number one spot in London Times Square ad spend dropped by 10% that year. This, combined with the fact that other agencies were launching ads and not only remained competitive with British Airways, but had been on the TV screen at night, and the advertising content in all the commercials, also had to be boosted. The problem was that a lot of the advertising","Advertising on trial It was not easy to stay creative during this very dark period of the British economy.

"It’s true, there are good and bad poetry writers out there. Good poets take some time to develop an eye for poetic meter and imagery, and many fail to keep this in mind. Ignoring this common error on the part of many writers, I present the following chart to show how to determine the size of an unruly poem: How to Write a Poem a Poem a Poem in One or Two Lines The first question to ask yourself is how much space to make, and how long you’ll make the poem. A poem has a meter of around 10 lines. Once you know what your line count is, then you can consider how many lines to make to best fit it in. A good line count is 3 lines: 1 line should be 5 lines; 4 lines should be 4 lines; and 5 lines should be 6 or 8 lines. A good rule of thumb is to write at least 2 lines longer than the minimum of 3 lines, and 2 lines shorter than that. For more guidance and specific suggestions, check out this post on how to figure out what to write. To keep the lines together, make sure the rhyme scheme is balanced with at least 3 consonant (I recommend 8 consonant sounds only). You’ll need to do this step twice to make your line count: once when you have the line count where it is 8 and 4 lines, and then again when the","How to Write Poetry Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face.

Poetry is an art in which the poet uses language and images to create meaning. Poetry should not be treated as a science, it is the product of a living process and must be treated with respect in order to become something valuable. It can be an avocation or it can be a job. Poetry should be developed in its entirety through the process of writing in whatever form seems the most suitable and appropriate to the poem. 2. The first stage in learning how to write poetry is to read a wide variety of poetry, especially English poetry. As soon as you have read a few poems, you should keep on reading them until you find something you enjoy. Keep reading to build up your vocabulary, to become familiar with all kinds of different styles of poetry. Try reading some poetry that you have never heard before. You might find yourself inspired to write a poem. 3. To write a poem, you need to imagine, to write something without thinking about anything. You might have an idea for a poem while you are walking in the woods, or while you are dreaming. You might have an idea for a poem when you feel lonely or when you are scared or in a strange situation. 4. Write a poem from the same point of view or from different points of view. The goal is not to try to make your poem better or more complicated. The focus must be on expressing your thoughts, feelings and opinions.

"Amazon.com offers up a lot more than books and the occasional recommendation or two. It also has a great selection of free and low cost literary criticism books, which in itself is a nice little bonus. For example, I did a Google search for ""daily dose of literary criticism"" and came up with my own personal favourite. On this site, I offer a list of recommended books, selected according to my taste and not by random. I have included links to reviews from The New Yorker, the Washington Post, Time, the Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, Salon.com, and many other respected magazines and publications. The titles on offer are all fairly diverse, and the book reviews on the site are far from exhaustive. However, I feel that the site offers an important contribution to the broader field of literary criticism. I hope that readers, and writers, will be encouraged by the variety of literary criticism offered. As well as the usual fare I try to include anecdotes and tidbits on various readings, movies, music, and food. There are many things on offer which are of interest to anyone interested in contemporary literature. There are also two other main categories of information, one of which is the Amazon Review.

In a fit of true inspiration and self-analysis I asked myself: Do I really have the courage to accept God’s call on my life? A life of faithful and generous service? Or do I simply want to be famous for being one of the biggest talkers of the world and the most influential Christian speaker in history?,"I waited to be told that cowboys only have big boots. Cowboys also have big hearts. They are compassionate and love people. They are honest. That’s why cowboys have big hearts. I’d give anything to give cowboys my heart. In short, cowboys care for others. When I heard that, I cried.","It was a strange morning. I could not believe the way the clouds broke. The sun was so hot. It felt like I was about to get burned, yet I had arrived at the desert. It felt like I had been thrown into the middle of a scene in the western movie ""Cowboy Bebop"". I couldn’t shake the feeling that I would die before getting to the desert. My heart began to race. It took me a moment to calm down. And then I could feel my pulse pick up.

No, they just were not. I have had my fair share of adventures on the road, but it wasn’t until I sat down on the sand, looked out at the desert, and remembered that there was a cowboy who had a solution to what I was feeling.

"If a bird makes you sick, does it mean your bad luck has arrived? Could a bird be telling you that a bad car crash is coming? Could a bird be trying to let you know that you’re not worth spending time with? A recent study published in the journal Conservation Biology found that we’ve inherited a lot of skepticism about birds, and these beliefs are likely to lead us astray, writes the author of the study: Dr Susan M. Bender: Birds are not our personal saviors, but our saviors nonetheless. They make us think we should take care of our families and our homes, but they can also be a drain on the planet. “People are fascinated by birds in various ways but they also have a tendency to judge their actions as positive or negative by what they think other people will think, especially if they can think of positive or negative consequences, such as a house being overrun,” says Bender. Then there’s the myth of the wren, a bird with an enigmatic personality that people consider threatening, frightening or sacred. It’s an ancient belief that birds had a recurring pattern of dropping a piece of worm, the seedpod, onto their prey as a warning. To eschew this danger, wrens were left to die. Another","My girlfriend and I are walking home from my mother's house in rural North Carolina when we hear a loud noise. We rush over and investigate, and see that a little brown shuttlecock has bounced against the glass. It turns out that it is a wren - a bird of portent, augury and divination. Is it spelling out some sort of message from a world at the very edges of my imagination? Or is it just a poor bird stuck in a greenhouse? Depending on your point of view, both could be true. You could say that your bird is a wren, and it is giving you a message about something eerily related to your own life. Or you could say that your bird is a wren, and it is an ominous bird, indicating that something may be about to happen to you. Or you could say that it's a poor bird, and you're just glad that it's not dead. To answer your questions: If your bird is an ominous bird, it's probably sending you a message or warning you about something in your life that you want to change. You'll need to look up some wren myths to find out why they believe in omens, augury and divination.","A bird has been our symbol for the past couple of thousand years. It's a small bird, with a long tailed body and feathers. They were regarded as creatures of darkness and mystery, with an unwavering belief in their power to utter warnings and ill omens, and as messengers of bad things to come. Despite a few rudimentary attempts to understand their language, humans still haven't quite been able to answer the question: are we all just birdwatchers? One theory is that birds are actually much smarter than people give them credit for. A quick survey of a few popular websites suggests a number of people agree that there is a wren and a number of people disagree on which one is the most interesting. Some people believe the wren is a messenger from a strange parallel world that we ourselves created. Others say that birds are messengers from another dimension that is a part of the material world and not the spirit world.","""The myths and rituals around birds are as old as the world itself. For humans, birds have eluded the boundaries of our imaginations, and we have created fantastical ideas about them in fanciful ways.""","Love them fear them worship them, the human race has always been drawn to birds. Birds have been the subject of countless songs and tales of bad luck, misfortune, or just plain old pity. But if they are more than just cute little creatures, they have also played important roles in human history. To the early Greeks, birds were considered harbingers of death. To the Egyptians, they were symbols of regeneration and immortality, and they tamed their ferocious predators by giving them wings. In the 18th century, some early bird watchers began to use ""wrens"" as symbols of fright and fear, with the famous 1931 painting ""Wren frightened and starving"" (Michael Jackson) starring a wren frightened and starving. More recent studies have sounded different, including a 2009 study on an international bird watchers' group in the US claiming wrens are a ""fear of the supernatural"" and that they help to break bad dreams. In one study, wrens were considered to warn of the upcoming of the end of the world in 1337. The findings were backed by further work, including a 2010 study that claims wrens are ""a symbol of mortality and death."" The birds are also part of our collective","The birds in my greenhouse have always been my fascination. A little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass as it hops around from plant to plant, and we're both happy he's hanging around. But what does it say about us? Paul Evans explains how his interest in bird behaviour began as a child when he saw a crow in a tree at school. This piqued his curiosity and he wanted to be like that bird. So he went to college to study psychology. But even as he got better at studying the behaviour of birds, he continued to observe them closely. He discovered that although birds are ominous, they're also just shy, playful creatures. These traits can make it difficult for people to be friends with them. ""It's always going to be this way,"" he told Nature. ""I think there's a lot of mistrust, but also a lot of empathy. I don't want them to be a troublesome bird. But to be a little bit kind to them would be a great beginning."" Paul's fascination with birds continues to this day as he writes a weekly column for the Guardian about life in the countryside.","Paul Evans says we owe a lot to birds: the animals we've worshipped for hundreds of years, the symbols we've tied to our own cultures, the mysteries we've astonished with. But is all this just about bird-watching? It's part of the British Museum's Natural History collections, the largest of its kind in Europe. Over the past 100 years, more than 2,000 different kinds of bird have been culled from museums there, including more than 5,000 different species of wrens, a bird of portent. Evans has visited the collections in London, Berlin, and Rome, and he reflects on the cultural significance of birds in human culture."

"I can't tell you how many chapters of the book I can dispense with. The only place that I haven't abridged is the entire ending of the book. Ultimately, even though the book was written before I was born, I know what I wanted to include. As the script sat on my desk I thought back to what I had already penned in my head and said, ""What would you do if you had this?"" I then decided to make it less confusing for the reader by making that part of the book go away. The ending of the book has a different message, a different point. We no longer need to know what the hell happened to the characters who died at the beginning of the book. It's only our job to imagine what they do next in the course of events.

They understand why they did what they did. It also helps to imagine that the audience will not get a chance to catch the movie at the theatre before it opens.

"AMERICAN executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management, writes Eluned Price for the BBC. As The Telegraph points out, 'the polar explorer was a 'people person'. He would ask the people to do what he needed them to do, and did not ask them to do things they shouldn't have done.' Shackleton is credited with leading the most dangerous expedition of his age – the expedition of the Endurance – to the South Pole, but was eventually forced to quit despite the fact that he feared the cold. After his death in 1914, the American public seemed to get the polar exploration bug. His life was celebrated as an example of good management. A documentary about his life and accomplishments is currently in production. The US icebreaker Pelican, which has never attempted a crossing of the Antarctic ice, will be shown at a public celebration in Washington, D.C., on January 31. 'We're going into the future – we're going to be trying to be successful in the future', says a Pelican spokeswoman. Sir Ernest died in 1922, but his name and voyage are still widely known.","Ernest Shackleton had the reputation as a 'People Person': he didn't worry about himself or the company he ran. He knew when it was time to put the men first and, like any manager, gave the job to the people he wanted to manage.

"Photographs are a means of transferring experience and information. The way you experience something in a photograph can be very different from the way you experience a story or other text. For example, you can easily experience the feeling of being confronted with a threat or danger. You can experience these emotions by looking at photographs of violence. These are the kind of images that help you understand and accept human behaviour. However, when you try to experience a scene with someone you haven’t met you’re less likely to experience the same kinds of emotions. Photographing an object that you haven’t met has a very different effect on your perception of the subject. When you see the image of a woman with an artificially long braid at a carnival you’re probably more likely to interpret the image as a representation of female sexuality. You’re probably more likely to interpret it as a representation of being in love. It’s not clear to me whether people would have this reaction to photographs from a completely different culture than their own. It’s possible that they would feel more cynical when they saw one of these kinds of images in a foreign land. So, it’s up to you. This book is designed to help you explore the images you see in the real world. By studying your favorite photographs you’ll begin to develop an understanding of how the world is presented in pictures -","I think photography has a place in society and is important to all of us. I think you have to consider what a photograph means, how a photographer takes a photograph and what influences the choice of images that you see.","Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience, together with a set of social and cultural norms. And in the course of this book we shall see how these factors not only affect the style content and expression of a photograph, but also how those images are perceived and responded to by the viewer. For example, we might consider that the casual reader of a newspaper will have an implicit understanding of the photographic images reproduced on the page.","Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills personal views and experience together with a set of social and cultural norms.

"‘Don’t worry, Maurice. I know he will enjoy it as much as I am.’ I replied. Maurice, not quite knowing where to begin, said: ‘But what if I change my mind?’ I explained. He said that the money he had given me for a trip to the United States was not the money that Maurice had really given him in the first place. Maurice had said that his father had sent him money from Paris but I did not think Maurice had actually ever made any money in Paris. I also doubted whether Maurice was willing to invest his money if he did not know how much he could get for it in a few months. ‘So why did you give your money to the man who had never even lived there?’ my father asked with a smile. I looked back at my father and asked ‘What do you mean?’ ‘Well, I’m afraid you’ll have to pay for it,’ Maurice replied. ‘I mean the tuition fees,’ I replied. ‘I think he’s going to charge you even more for doing something so stupid.’ Maurice laughed and my father said nothing. I said ‘I understand Maurice’s point of view, and so I’ll just leave you with that’.","My Father told me a story that he had told me about the family business that he ran. When he told this story to his son I was so excited that I blurted it out to him. He said that when he was in his younger days, he was an entrepreneur and used to juggle business and family. Now he was retired and the family business was the usual business that he took care of. Then one day when I was about to tell the story he asked, ‘Well, now, can you tell me a bit about it?’ ‘Yes, Dad.’ I said. ‘It’s quite simple really. When a businessman takes over another family business, they start thinking how they can make money on that business. He has the whole family to manage so he has to have Maurice, the boy, take care of it. He takes Maurice in to bed in the morning, and Dad takes Maurice to a special restaurant and Maurice buys me a bottle of champagne and then he leaves. Then Maurice takes care of Maurice and takes Maurice to dinner and Maurice takes Maurice to my room and Maurice spends the night at my parents’ house. Then Maurice gives all the money from the wine in our cellar to Maurice and Maurice gets a book of travel guides. But if Maurice wants the",The Family Business ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father with my brother Maurice in tow had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls’ school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent’s Day in the course of which I was presented with the Latin prize and the prize for the girl who had done best in her end-of-school exams. He had had a long conversation with my headteacher and now here we were bound for home and holidays. ‘What isn’t?’ I said though I had guessed the trend of his thoughts from his unusual silence.,"You see there are two reasons why I won the Latin prize. The first is that I studied at the school. I am used to doing well in exams and I am used to doing well at the school. It’s all in the preparation. I could not resign early so I had to finish my last exam on Wednesday before going into school. The second reason is that I didn’t win the prize for the girl who did best in her end-of-school exams. The last reason is that when my father collected me from the school, he handed me over to Maurice. Maurice knew what he was doing and I suspected he could not do it. I was wrong. I had made my best in my final exams, though the only grades I got on my last exam were ‘B’ and ‘C’. I should have scored higher than those. The first reason is that Maurice is my brother. When I told him of my triumph over Maurice he paused but said, ‘It’s all right, Maurice.’ I hoped he could understand. Maurice smiled but told my father he was sorry. Maurice did not say anything to him about his feelings. My father said he would rather have Maurice to himself. He did so until my father spoke. Then he told Maurice that he would not be returning to London without me and my brother. He told","‘I’m sure it isn’t,’ I said. ‘How’d you know it wasn’t?’ ‘Dad figured it was because he was looking for another job when I had finished school. He then went into Maurice’s room to retrieve the key, when he realised I had left the door open. He screamed after me and threw Maurice’s keys down the stairs. But I ran across Maurice standing in front of the door. He had the key in the lock, and he had already gone in to get it. ‘Let me get it and get Maurice out of there,’ I said. ‘I didn’t want you doing that!’ ‘You didn’t do it for Maurice!’ Maurice screamed. ‘The house is locked!’ Maurice screamed. ‘It’s not open!’ ‘But I do’ Maurice screamed. ‘You must have knocked on the door and the key is not there!’ ‘Well, you’re going to have to get to the other side of the house anyway because there is a ladder outside!’ ‘You can get to it, Maurice’ my father said. Maurice looked into the room where he had fallen to his death so I helped him out. But Maurice isn’","He looked at me with a curious look and then he said, ‘Look here it’s no good!’ ‘It’s not,’ I said. ‘It could be that my headteacher doesn’t like me, and that they don’t really want to know. But you shouldn’t worry too much. I suppose you will be just fine.’",The Family Business ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London.

So, a good opera is music with drama.","MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more.

"Those are my thoughts on writing a book review. Mostly I like what Frank Kermode writes but I have a few things he says which make me uncomfortable. The book review is more of a critique than a review. You have to be critical and objective and you can’t just give a broad overview. If a book is worth reading, then it must be read. When I write a book review I also go into some very interesting theoretical territory which is quite a lot more advanced than just book reviewing. For instance, I go into literary criticism and philosophy. In my personal view, philosophy, and religion are some of the most important fields in literature today so I am sure it’s interesting to read about how both areas have evolved over the last twenty or thirty years. As I read, I see how my thinking on a certain subject is shaped by my cultural background and how that has shaped my reading. The fact that I have such a large amount of knowledge about a particular field shows that if you have a good grasp of that field then you are in a much better position to give a more coherent and well-informed opinion. Obviously, I don’t think I always do a good job of explaining the reason why I agree with a given stance or argument. But I also realise that there is a lot to learn from other perspectives and that it’s very","Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life.

"The film Citizen Kane was released in 1941. After the flamboyant opening scene, I was shocked, stunned, and even sickened at the scenes in the following two acts. The final scene that left me speechless was the final scene, where he was literally buried alive. Then I was awed once more by what welles had accomplished in such a short period. Kane was an enigma. A living, breathing man on the verge of death. He was not the only man to lose his life but his only son. And, of course, his grandson, William Randolph Hearst, was not only his source of the story but, apparently, it was the only man to have ever actually seen Kane. For one brief but terrifying moment in the final scene, an unidentified man, possibly a security guard, stepped out and jumped off a building. Kane stepped back and looked around. A shadowy figure in the distance made its way toward him, seemingly a person or thing standing before him. It seemed to me he was not the same man who had witnessed him on the day that he had lost his life but perhaps the same man who would see him in the future. But Kane did not merely take his life on that day but rather he took the life of a man that would – in the end – still","Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941, despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of the distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst’s alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success.

"Breakfast came to England about 1600. In the fifteenth century, England had been plagued by disease, particularly for women. People who were overweight or obese would eat a late night snack before supper. This also encouraged the consumption of salt and sugar in an attempt to counteract the effects of alcohol and tobacco.","England’s breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts, but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. Admittedly, there are scattered references to travellers having a meal at dawn before embarking on arduous journeys and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without unless they were monarchs or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century, it gradually became the norm not the exception.
