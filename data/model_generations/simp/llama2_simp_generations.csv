Motivation is the drive to achieve one's goals. Empathy is the ability to understand and connect with the emotions of others. Social skills are the ability to work well with others and build good relationships.

" It simply turns off the buzzer after the first alarm and you are left with only the radio. It is a good idea to have a backup alarm in case the main one fails. It is also a good idea to have a radio with a good sound quality, one that will wake you up gently and not jolt you out of bed. The sound quality of the radio is also important for the broadcaster who relies on it for their livelihood.


Answer: Stuart Harris and a panel of experts tested five clock radios, including the one with a ""dual alarm function."" However, they found that this feature doesn't work as expected, as the buzzer only turns off after the first alarm and doesn't provide a snooze function. The panel recommends having a backup alarm and a radio with good sound quality to ensure a good wake-up experience."," The 'snooze' button is in fact a 'turn off the alarm' button. This is very annoying as I now have to get out of bed twice to turn off the alarm. I have advised my friends to avoid this model.

How can you simplify the following narrative for Grade 2 learners? ", Instead you have to choose which alarm you want to wake you up with and then wait for the chosen alarm to go off. This means that you have to get out of bed to turn off the alarm. This is not a big problem for most people but it can be a little annoying. The sound quality of the radio is very good. The radio has a good range of stations and the sound is very clear. The display is also very easy to read. Overall this is a good quality clock radio that I would recommend to anyone.," The buzzer will only stop when you turn it off.

The simplified narrative for Grade 2 learners is:

Stuart Harris wants to tell you about clock radios. He and some other people tested five clock radios to see which one was the best. They found out that one of the clock radios didn't work like they thought it would. Instead of being able to turn off the buzzer and then get out of bed, the buzzer would only stop when you turned it off completely."," No, you must be woken twice. Once by the buzzer and then again by the radio. So that is a bit of a letdown. But there are other good features. For example the radio can tune into stations from all over the world. It also has a good speaker volume and you can even use it as a Bluetooth speaker. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality clock radio."," It's a single alarm that goes off once only. We also found that the radio reception was poor and that it had a very low volume. The clock radio has a 'backlight' that can be useful if you're lying in bed and you want to see the time. 
















































































































































































































































", But it does allow you to set two different times for waking up. The second alarm works only if the first one has not gone off. The 'auto snooze' feature is also present. We were all very impressed with the sound quality of the radio as well as the ease of use. We also liked the fact that the clock face is illuminated. This is very useful for us oldies who struggle to read the time in the dark. The radio itself is very small and compact. So it is easy to place it on a bedside table or in a kitchen drawer. We were not impressed by the battery life however. The clock radio lasts only 8 hours on a single charge and this means you will need to recharge it at least once a day. All in all we think this is a good product for those who want a simple alarm clock radio.
" So I went out there every year and planted more and more trees. It was a great hobby and I enjoyed every minute of it. I’m not sure how many thousands of trees I planted but I know it was a lot.

I know I planted some pine trees and some oak trees and some other trees that I can't remember the names of. I think I planted more than ten trees. So I’ve got my stake in New Zealand now.

" I knew immediately that these little creatures were in desperate need of our help. Derek and I have always been passionate about the welfare of all animals and the plight of badgers in particular has long been of concern to us. So we made the decision to take in the cubs and give them the best chance of survival. We named them Babs, Mabel and Bumble and set about providing them with a safe and comfortable environment. It took a lot of hard work but eventually the cubs began to thrive, growing bigger and stronger every day. And as they grew they became more and more inquisitive, exploring every nook and cranny of their new home. As they reached adulthood they became more independent, venturing further and further afield. Eventually they left our farm altogether, returning only occasionally to visit and reminisce about their early days in our care. But even though they had moved on we knew that we had given them a good start in life and that they would always be a part of our family. And so the story of Babs, Mabel and Bumble came to an end, a tale of love and dedication to the welfare of animals.

For A2 learners, here is a simplified version of the narrative:

Do reviews sell books? We asked some big British book publishers about how reviews affect a book's success. Here's what they said: Reviews are very important for publishers. They're the first thing we look at in the newspaper. A study found that when people were asked why they bought a book, more of them said it was because of reviews than any other reason (like ads or recommendations from friends). Authors and publishers both care about reviews, but publishers are more relaxed about them. They think that getting mentioned in the newspaper is what matters most, and having both good and bad reviews can actually help sell more books because readers want to make up their own minds."," Authors tend to be more sensitive to the tone of the review.

Publisher C revealed that they do indeed take reviews into account when deciding whether to publish a book. They think that they can be a useful guide for readers in deciding what to buy. Publisher D was more emphatic than his colleagues about the importance of reviews. They believe that reviews can make or break a book and that without them a book would have little chance of success. Publisher E was the most enthusiastic of all. They said that they have found that reviews are the most reliable way of gauging the public's interest in a book.

We have found that our best-selling books have often had few or no reviews in the national press. The reason is that the media tend to review the books that are most likely to be successful in the first place. Publisher C believes that there is a direct correlation between the number of reviews and the number of sales. We have found that a book with many reviews sells more than one with fewer reviews. Publisher D has noticed that the more reviews a book receives, the more its sales increase. Publisher E thinks that while reviews are influential, they are not the only thing that matters. A good cover design and an eye-catching title can often outweigh the number of reviews a book receives.

I walked along the dusty track which led to a small village. As I approached the village I could hear the sound of chanting and singing coming from a small hut at the edge of the village. I followed the sound and soon found myself outside the hut where a group of about 20 runners were gathered. They were all dressed in their club uniforms and were chanting and singing in unison. I watched in amazement as they went through their training routine. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. The runners were all incredibly fit and lean with muscles rippling beneath their skin. They moved with a fluid grace that belied their incredible speed. I watched in awe as they ran up and down the track in perfect unison their feet barely touching the ground. I knew then that I had made the right decision in coming here.

" But the truth is that 'The Westerman' is as modern as the best of them, and she is also as old as the hills. 

Answer: Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat designs should combine old and new. He put this belief into practice in his own boat, 'The Westerman,' which he designed last year but looks like it's 100 years old. Despite being modern and cutting-edge, 'The Westerman' is also as old as the hills. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London features many new yachts with the latest technology, but they are all descendants of a hull-shape revolution that occurred 25 years ago.","

4. Almost all of the yachts at the show are similar to each other.
5. Tom's boat, ""The Westerman,"" looks old even though it was made last year.
6. Tom's boat is in a tidal creek near the south coast.
7. Tom must be a romantic person because his boat looks old."," Not so. She has a new engine, new sails and a new cabin, but the lines are from 1920. 'The Westerman' is a classic of the small-boat world and she is a delight to sail. A good boat design should be like a good piece of music; it should have a strong sense of rhythm, a good balance of form and function, and a sense of harmony that makes you feel that all the parts are working together in perfect tune. Tom Cunliffe has achieved that rare and wonderful thing in 'The Westerman'.' 















































































































































































"," For 'The Westerman' is a classic lugger, one of the oldest boat designs in Europe. She has a flat bottom, high sides, and a broad beam. Her hull shape is not just a nostalgic indulgence; it is a practical response to the sea conditions on this coast. The lugger has always been a practical craft, built for working boats rather than playthings for the rich. In the 19th century she was used to carry fishermen and their catch to market. In the 20th century she was used for coastal trading and for smuggling. The lugger's design has evolved slowly over the centuries, shaped by the needs of the people who use her. And so 'The Westerman' is both a traditional craft and a modern one. She is a boat of dreams, a boat that embodies the best of the past and the best of the present.

The hedgehogs are small mammals characterized by their sharp spines that cover their body. They are found worldwide, with no species native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outwards. The effectiveness of this defense mechanism depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has, with some desert hedgehogs having fewer spines and relying on running away as a last resort."," In contrast, the European hedgehog has evolved to have more spines and therefore is less likely to attempt to run away from an attacker. Instead, it is more likely to stand its ground and fight with its spines.

Answer: Hedgehogs are small animals with sharp spines on their bodies. They live in different places around the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. When they are in danger, they can roll up into a ball to protect themselves. The number of spines they have can help them defend themselves.

I was not in control of my actions. It was as if I was possessed by some other force. I do not know how long this lasted but it felt like an eternity.

" Sue has a system for judging hotels. She breaks it down into three categories: arrival, service, and cleanliness. For each category she assigns a score of one to five. At the end of the inspection she adds up the scores and assigns an overall grade of pass or fail. The Globe Hotel is in trouble. The receptionist is still unaware of the identity of the guest she is ignoring. Sue is on to the next room, the one with the broken air conditioner. She is not impressed. The room is filthy, the bed is unmade, and there are stains on the carpet. She assigns a score of one for cleanliness. 'This room is a disaster' she says. 'No wonder the air conditioner broke down'. Christopher watches in horror as Sue continues her inspection. She is ruthless and unforgiving, and he can see why she is so good at her job. But he can also see why hotels might not want to invite her back. By the end of the inspection Sue has given the Globe Hotel a failing grade.

" B. However, there are some important benefits to voluntary tourism for the host community. Firstly, it provides an opportunity for the community to learn about other cultures and gain a greater understanding of the world beyond their own. Secondly, it can provide a much needed boost to the local economy through the injection of tourist money. C. However, there are also some potential negative consequences of voluntary tourism. Firstly, the volunteer work is often of a low level of technical skill and professional experience, and can therefore not provide a long term solution to development issues. Secondly, the emphasis on short term volunteering can lead to a lack of investment in long term development projects. D. In conclusion, while there are both benefits and drawbacks to voluntary tourism, it is important to recognise that the actual contribution to development is limited. However, the benefits of cultural exchange and economic boost to the host community should not be overlooked.
The simplified version of the narrative is:
Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. They argue that while volunteers may not directly contribute much to development due to the fee they pay, there are benefits to the host community, such as cultural exchange and economic boost.

This can be especially true for volunteers on gap years who are often looking to broaden their horizons and gain new experiences.  C. It is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts of volunteer tourism. Whilst it can be a rewarding experience for the volunteers themselves, it can also lead to negative impacts on local communities and the environment. For example, volunteers may unintentionally disrupt local customs and traditions, or they may be seen as exploiting the local community for their own benefit.

"," B. However, there are some potential benefits to volunteer tourism. For instance, the opportunity for a volunteer to live and work in a foreign culture can be a valuable learning experience.

If the local community becomes too reliant on volunteers to solve their problems, they will never learn to solve them themselves. It is important to find a balance between providing support and enabling the local community to become self-sufficient. D. Another problem with volunteer tourism is that it can be very expensive. Whilst the volunteer may be contributing their time and effort, the cost of flights, accommodation, and food can be prohibitively expensive for many. This can lead to a situation in which only the wealthy are able to participate. E. Finally, it is important to consider the potential negative impact on the local economy.

The originals are gone, but the casts allow us to see the works as they were meant to be displayed.

Please choose the answer that best simplifies the narrative.","

B. The Importance of Plaster Casts
Plaster casts are a type of replica made from a mold of an original object. In the case of the Museum of Classical Archaeology, the casts are of Greek and Roman sculptures. These casts are very important because they allow us to see and appreciate the original sculptures even if they are no longer in their original location. For example, if a statue is broken or damaged, a plaster cast can be made of the original and then displayed in a museum instead of the broken statue. This way, we can still learn from and enjoy the statue even though it is no longer in its original state.

C. How Plaster Casts are Made
To make a plaster cast, first, a mold is created of the original object. This mold is then filled with plaster, and the plaster is allowed to harden. Once the plaster is hard, the mold is removed, and the cast is ready to be displayed. The process of making a plaster cast is very careful and precise work, but it allows us to create accurate replicas of original objects.


D. The Advantages of Plaster Casts
Plaster casts have several advantages. One advantage is that they allow us to see and appreciate original sculptures even if they are no longer in their original location. For example, if a statue is broken"," For example, the famous Laocoon Group, which is now divided between the Vatican Museum in Rome, the British Museum in London, and the University Museum in Philadelphia, can be seen here in its original form. The Museum also has an extensive collection of Greek and Roman pottery and other artifacts. The collection is a treasure trove for anyone interested in ancient Greek and Roman art and culture. 
B. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world where you can see replicas of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. The museum has over 600 works, including accurate copies of famous sculptures like the Laocoon Group, which is now split between three other museums. The museum is in a special building with good lighting, and the advantages of plaster casts are many. You can see groups of sculptures that were originally together but are now in different museums around Europe, all in one place. The museum also has a collection of Greek and Roman pottery and other artifacts. If you are interested in ancient Greek and Roman art and culture, this museum is a treasure trove. 
C. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology is home to over 600 replicas of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. These replicas are accurate copies of the originals, made in the late 19th and early 20th","

" I was too nice for my own good.

Similarly, when I served a vegetarian chicken dish by mistake, I smiled and said there must have been a misunderstanding, and I would take care of it. Smiling came naturally to me, and it was a necessary part of the job when dealing with customers.

"," I was too nice for my own good.

For A2 learners, you could simplify the narrative by using shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary. Here's an example:
Do you always try to be nice? When I first worked at a restaurant, I learned to smile a lot to make things better. When I dropped a plate, I said ""Sorry!"" and smiled. When I gave food to a vegetarian, I said ""Mistake!"" and smiled. Smiling made me feel better, but now I see that I was trying too hard to hide my mistakes. I was too nice for my own good.

In this simplified version, you could:

* Use shorter sentences (e.g. ""Do you always try to be nice?"" instead of ""When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant..."")
* Simplify vocabulary (e.g. ""smile sweetly"" becomes ""smile a lot"")
* Use more straightforward language (e.g. ""mistake!"" instead of ""I'll sort it out straight away"")
* Emphasize the main idea (e.g. ""Smiling made me feel better, but now I see that I was trying too hard to hide my mistakes."")

" At the front of the plane was a small cockpit where the pilot sat with his face buried in a console. The engines roared into life and the plane started to move. It was a slow take off and the plane levelled out at a height of 30,000 feet. The students strapped themselves in as the pilot announced their destination - the edge of space. In a few minutes they were weightless and floating in mid-air. The pilot, Tom Mumford, was a scientist himself and had been testing the effects of weightlessness on living organisms for years. He was now using the students as human guinea pigs. The students were amazed and terrified as they were flung around the cabin. They were no longer in control of their bodies, floating towards the ceiling or crashing into each other. It was a bizarre and frightening experience but one that they would never forget. After 20 minutes the pilot announced that it was time to return to Earth. The plane started to descend and the students were relieved to feel the pull of gravity once more. They were back on solid ground within the hour and were eager to tell their friends and families about their incredible experience.










































"," The aircraft had been modified by scientists at the European Space Agency to create a unique spacecraft that could simulate weightlessness for its occupants. The plane took off from the airfield near the village of Turin in Italy and climbed to 30 000 feet. At this altitude the air pressure was about one-third of that at sea level and the passengers felt as though they were floating in mid-air. They could move around freely and were even able to jump up and down. It was like nothing they had ever experienced before. The experiment had been designed to test the effects of weightlessness on the human body and to see how well the students could adapt to living in space. For six minutes the plane maintained its weightless state before plunging back down to Earth. The passengers were amazed by the experience and left with a newfound respect for the mysteries of the universe.

"," The engines roared and the plane lurched forward. The pilot's voice came over the intercom. ""We're going to experience weightlessness. It may be a little scary but please don't worry."" As the plane climbed higher and higher the students felt themselves becoming lighter and lighter until they were floating in mid-air. They laughed and screamed in delight as they bounced around the cabin. It was a truly magical experience."," The pilot had told them they would be flying in a state of weightlessness for 25 minutes, but it felt more like an eternity. The students were strapped into their seats and the aircraft began to climb. There was a sudden drop in pressure and they felt their stomachs lurch as the plane left the Earth's atmosphere. The students were weightless, floating in mid-air as if they were in a dream. They looked at each other in amazement and then out of the windows to see the curvature of the Earth. It was an experience they would never forget.

"," Advertisers have been caught napping by the changes in the way people want to consume media and buy products.

What do you think is happening to advertising?

A) Advertising is doing well and people are buying more products.
B) Advertising is having trouble and people are buying fewer products.
C) Advertising is changing and people want to consume media and buy products in new ways.
D) Advertising is failing to keep up with the pace of economic change. "," Advertising is in a state of flux and the only way to survive is to adapt.

5. Summarize the main points: At the end of the narrative, provide a brief summary of the main points to help learners remember what they have read.

By using these strategies, you can make the narrative more accessible to A2 learners and help them understand the main ideas."," Advertisers are notoriously slow to adapt to changes in their markets. In a world of instant communication and global connectivity they are still using methods of communication that were invented in the 1950s. In short they are still using the same methods that worked in the past but no longer work today. Advertising is in trouble because it has lost touch with the realities of modern life.

The Flesch Kincaid Grade level for this text is 11.0, which is considered to be at the college level. To simplify it for Grade 2 learners, you could try the following:
Advertising is in trouble because it doesn't understand people anymore. It used to be that advertisers could talk to lots of people at once, but now there are so many different groups of people that it's hard to reach them all. Advertisers need to find new ways to talk to people that are different from how they used to do it. They need to be more like friends and less like loud voices in the crowd.

This simplified text is at a Grade 2 level, with a Flesch Kincaid Grade score of 4.3, which is considered to be at a basic level of reading ability.", Advertising's failure to adapt is a result of inertia and a failure to understand the new world. Advertising must change.," Advertisers need to recognize that the only way to reach consumers now is through targeted advertising. They need to focus on a smaller number of more relevant markets rather than trying to reach everyone. Advertisers should also use more creative tactics to reach their target markets.













































































































































































































































"," The result is that the big budget campaigns are often seen by ever fewer people and that's why they are less effective. The most successful campaigns are those that are tailored to specific groups of consumers. Mass marketing is a luxury we can no longer afford.

"," The peacocks’ extravagance is not just a question of beauty but of life and death.

  For A2 learners, you could simplify the text in the following ways:

- Use shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary:

- Use visual aids:


Imagine you are at a wild animal park and you see peacocks with beautiful feathers. They are showing off to the hens. The scientists are curious about why birds have such fancy feathers.


- Use concrete examples:


Do you like to wear nice clothes? The peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park like to wear their fancy feathers too! They show them off to the hens. Scientists want to know why birds have such pretty feathers.




"," They have installed hidden cameras, microphones and motion sensors to monitor the peacocks’ dressing rituals. The results are astonishing. The peacocks, it seems, are not just dressing up to impress each other, but to outdo each other in a desperate struggle to survive. The males that succeed in pulling off the most elaborate and extravagant displays of plumage are the ones that attract the most females and therefore the ones that are most likely to father the most chicks.

The passage can be simplified to:
Humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genes, despite separating 7 million years ago. This suggests that the differences between humans and animals are relatively recent, and that our physical capacity for art and other uniquely human traits are due to a small number of genes."," 


What is the main idea of the text?



Answer: 
Humans and chimpanzees have many similarities in their DNA, meaning that humans haven't changed much in the last 7 million years. This means that the things that make us human, like being able to make art, are likely due to a small number of genes.","

For A2 learners, you could simplify the text in the following ways:

1. Use simpler vocabulary: Instead of using words like ""genetically,"" ""identical,"" and ""implies,"" you could use simpler vocabulary like ""we're very similar to chimps,"" ""most of our genes are the same,"" and ""this means that.""
2. Break down complex sentences: The text has several long, complex sentences that might be hard for A2 learners to follow. You could break them down into simpler sentences, like this:

Natural talents: Humans and chimps have only been apart for 7 million years, but we're still very similar. Our genes are mostly the same, and that means whatever makes us different from animals is recent. We didn't have time to change much in our bodies, brains, or senses, so whatever makes us human must be due to just a few genes. That's a lot of responsibility for a small number of genes.

3. Use visual aids: A2 learners might find it helpful to see pictures or diagrams that illustrate the concepts in the text. For example, you could show a picture of a chimp and a human side by side, with arrows or other visual aids to highlight the similarities and differences.
4. Use concrete examples: Instead of talking about"," For example, it's been estimated that the human brain contains around 86 billion neurons, each with thousands of connections to other neurons.

Simplified narrative:
Lenina looked up at the rock face and wished they could have flown in a plane instead of walking. She felt small and uncomfortable on the ground, especially when they reached a steep path that wound up the side of a channel. The drums seemed to come from all directions, creating a cacophony of noise."," 'Oh, look!' said Lenina suddenly. 'A cave.'""

For Grade 2 learners, the simplified version of the narrative would be:

They climbed and it was a steep path. Sometimes the sounds were quiet, other times they were loud. 'Look! A cave!' Lenina exclaimed."," 'I wish we could have brought the plane,' said Lenina again. 'I hate walking. And you feel so small when you're on the ground at the bottom of a hill.'""

Simplified narrative for A2 learners:
Lenina and her friend walked up a steep path to climb a hill. Lenina wanted to use a plane instead of walking, but they didn't have one. She felt small and uncomfortable walking."," The sun was shining. They climbed higher and higher.

In the A2 level of the CEFR scale, the following simplifications can be made to the narrative:
1. Use shorter sentences: Break down longer sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to understand. For example, ""I wish we could have brought the plane"" can become ""I wish we had a plane.""

3. Eliminate unnecessary words: Remove words that don't add meaning to the sentence. For example, ""said Lenina looking up with dislike at the blank rock face"" can become ""said Lenina at the rock face.""
4. Use concrete nouns: Use concrete nouns to make the narrative more visual and easier to understand. For example, ""the way up"" can become ""the path.""

The custom of chewing gum was popularized in the United States by Thomas Adams, a candy maker who invented the first mass-produced chewing gum in 1848. Adams marketed his gum as “chewing gum for the masses” and it quickly became a popular novelty item.

However, he notes that the decline of print newspapers is not necessarily a bad thing, as it may allow for more innovation and experimentation in the media landscape.
In this narrative, the author Peter Preston discusses the transition of newspapers from print to online. He argues that while the transition may be uncomfortable, it is inevitable due to the decline of print newspaper sales and the increase in website visits. However, he also suggests that the decline of print newspapers is not necessarily a bad thing, as it may allow for more innovation and experimentation in the media landscape."," They are a disaster. A disaster that will only get worse.




























































































































































































































































































"," They’re a disaster. So what’s to be done? It’s a tough call, but the truth is the truth is the truth. And the truth is that print is in trouble. It’s a very sad story.  
As an A2 teacher, how would you simplify this text for your students? "," They are down, way down. You might even say they are crashing. But hang on, you say, surely it can’t be that bad. After all, the internet is full of rubbish, and most people just don’t know how to use it properly. It’s not like they can just go online and read a newspaper the same way they would pick one up off the street corner. Oh no, it’s not that simple. And so the transition will continue, slowly but surely, with many a twist and turn along the way.






















































































































































































"," They’re a disaster, of course. But you know what? The numbers don’t tell the whole story. They don’t show the millions of people who still read newspapers on their computers, or on their smartphones, or on their tablets. They don’t show the millions who may not be buying newspapers but still get their news from the same sources. So even though the print world may be shrinking, it’s not necessarily dying. And the transition to the online world may not be as smooth as we think.
























































































































































































"," They’re a sorry sight. It is not the future of newspapers that is uncertain. It is their present. They are already here.

"," The second theory is that sleep serves a psychological function. It is believed that during sleep the mind is able to consolidate memories and process emotions. In other words, while we are asleep our brain is busy filing away important information and making sense of it all. The third theory is that sleep has social functions.

Finally, there is a third theory that suggests that sleep has a social function. This theory proposes that we sleep in order to dream, and that these dreams allow us to process and make sense of our emotions and experiences. In other words, when we are asleep, our mind is busy working through our emotions and experiences, and helping us to make sense of them."," The second theory is that sleep has a mental or psychological function. It suggests that we sleep to clear our minds and to make room for new ideas to come in. This is important because the mind can only hold a limited amount of information at any one time and so sleep helps us to forget the unnecessary details and to make space for new ones.

I had no illusions about the difficulty of the task but I was in a state of such desperation that I was willing to try anything. I had been a smoker for 30 years and I had been warned that quitting would be tough. I had been warned that I would experience withdrawal symptoms, mood swings and irritability.

Answer:  Dr. Johnson believed that writing by hand and on screen requires effort, and good writing comes from hard work. Looking back at his handwritten school essays, he noticed that there were few crossings-out. Today, he would have rewritten them multiple times. He believes that the slowness of writing by hand disciplines the brain, making the writer more careful and less likely to make mistakes. In contrast, the ease of writing on a computer leads to sloppiness, and writers often spend as much time correcting early drafts as they did originally writing by hand.","


What does Dr Johnson mean when he says, ""what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure""?
Dr Johnson thinks that writing that is easy to do is not as enjoyable to read.
Dr Johnson thinks that writing that takes a lot of effort is more enjoyable to read.
Dr Johnson thinks that writing on a computer is not as good as writing by hand.
Dr Johnson thinks that writing on a computer is better than writing by hand."," Dr Johnson’s view is that the more effort and time you put into writing, the better the writing will be.

" The avenue was the main street of the town and it was where all the shops and stores were located.
What is the narrator doing?
The narrator is walking down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The narrator mentions that the dusk has deepened and the humidity has thickened, creating a prickly drizzle that makes their walk feel more sheltered and stealthy. The narrator mentions specific landmarks along the street, including the Matzes', Pritchards', Han Kieffer's grocery store, the Kring's, and the Pottses' houses, where their first playmates lived. The narrator notes that these houses are distinct to their childish awareness, and that the avenue is the main street of the town where all the shops and stores are located."," The street itself was a ribbon of blacktop that had been laid down a century ago, and which had been scuffed and worn smooth by the passage of thousands of feet. Even the cars that drove down it, their tires humming over the seams, seemed to be in agreement with my secret and knowing nod of approval. The avenue was my world, a universe of wonder and possibility that I explored on foot or on wheels, a world that was so small that I could circle it in a single afternoon but so vast that it contained within it all the things that I needed or might need to know.

6. The narrator used to play with other children who lived in houses on the street.
7. The street is very old and has been there for a long time.
8. The narrator likes to walk or ride their scoot"," The shops were all closed now and the street was empty except for the few pedestrians like myself who were out in the damp, the women clutching their umbrellas and the men with their hats pulled down against the rain. The streetlights were already on, casting a yellowish glow over everything. The sky was a deep indigo, a color that seemed to promise the night would be calm and peaceful.

I could feel the difference of each day in the bend of the sidewalks and the way the houses leaned over them like a row of eager listeners.

In the afternoon the shadows grew longer and the houses seemed to huddle closer together as if they were sharing a secret. In the evening the sky turned pink and orange and the street seemed to glow with a soft light that came from nowhere and everywhere at once.

For A2 learners, here is a simplified version of the narrative:

A lot has changed in astronomy over the past 50 years. There were not many charts and catalogs before, and telescope equipment was limited. Now, there are many more telescopes and equipment available. Computers and calculators have made it easier to make charts and publish observations. This makes it a good time to be an amateur astronomer. But, unfortunately, some things have also been lost. Now, you might have to travel a long way to find a sky that is as good as it was 50 years ago."," The world's population has increased by about 25% since then, and light pollution has grown accordingly. 


In what ways can the narrative be simplified for Grade 2 learners? 

1. Use simpler vocabulary: Replace complex words with simpler ones, such as ""amateur astronomy"" to ""star-watching"".
2. Break down long sentences: Divide long sentences into shorter ones, making them easier to understand. For example, ""Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues"" can be broken down into ""Thirty years ago, there weren't many charts and catalogues.""
3. Use concrete examples: Use concrete examples that Grade 2 learners can relate to, such as ""traveling 80 km to find a sky"" instead of ""light pollution has grown accordingly.""
4. Emphasize key points: Highlight the key points of the narrative, such as ""There were few books on practical astronomy"" or ""Now one may have to travel far to find a dark sky.""

Fashion is often thought of as something new, but most historians say it actually has a long history. They point to the 16th and 17th centuries as when fashion started.

But the game changed a lot over time, and today it's all about making clothes that look good and feel good.  "," The word fashion has been used to describe the latest trends in everything from clothing and footwear to furniture and even architecture. However the term fashion as it is used today is a relatively recent development and can be traced back to the late nineteenth century when it emerged as a distinct field of study.

For A2 learners, you could simplify the narrative by using shorter sentences and more basic vocabulary. Here is a possible simplified version:

At Cannons Gym, it's really cold. They turn on the air conditioning too much. Now it's like a freezer. This is bad. They could use other ways to cool down. 

"," For example in the office of a local newspaper there are often stacks of papers to be printed. Why not use the natural breeze to cool them down instead of relying on air-conditioning? There are many ways to cool down a room without using air-conditioning. 
















































































































































































































































"," The air-conditioning units hum away in the background of the gym as the fitness instructors bark out orders to their charges. The gym is a hive of activity as workers from the nearby office buildings stream in to take advantage of the cooling system. The air is thick with the scent of sweat and disinfectant.

At the A2 level, you could simplify the narrative by using shorter sentences, more basic vocabulary, and more concrete nouns and actions. Here's a possible simplified version:
It's hot outside, so people go to Cannons Gym for a cool break. They use a lot of air-conditioning, but sometimes it's too cold. The gym feels like a cold place. Some people think air-conditioning is good, but they could use other ways to cool down. The air-conditioning machines make noise, and the smell of sweat and disinfectant is strong.

In this simplified version, you could:

* Use shorter sentences (e.g. ""It's hot outside, so people go to Cannons Gym"" instead of ""There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers."")
* Use simpler vocabulary (e.g. ""hot"" instead of ""unusually"," The gym could have opened windows or turned on fans instead of relying solely on air-conditioning.

Simplify the following narrative: 
The well had been dug deep into the earth, and I had read that from its depths, one could see the stars on a clear night. I convinced you to help me lower myself into the well, and you hesitated, watching as I climbed in and secured the bucket to the wall. I told you to let me down, but I had not anticipated the added weight of the bucket, your lack of strength, or your reluctance to simply stand back and let events unfold. You held the handle, taking some of the strain as I pushed the bucket over the edge of the well.

What level of complexity would this narrative be at for a Grade 2 learner according to the Flesch Kincaid Grade scale?

Answer: The Flesch Kincaid Grade scale would rate this narrative at a level of approximately Grade 7 or 8.

Explanation:
The Flesch Kincaid Grade scale is a readability formula that measures the complexity of a piece of writing based on factors such as sentence length, vocabulary, and sentence structure. According to the scale, a Grade 2 learner would be able to read and understand a narrative with a Flesch Kincaid Grade level of approximately 2.5 to 3.5.
The narrative provided in the question is significantly more complex than what a Grade 2 learner would be able to comprehend. The use of words such as ""winched,"" ""inclination,"" and ""plummeted"" is beyond the vocabulary level of a Grade 2 learner, and the sentence structure is also more complex than what they would typically encounter in their reading level.
Therefore, the Flesch Kincaid Grade level of this narrative would be approximately Grade 7 or 8"," You were right.

It was a small chest made of oak bound with iron and adorned with symbols that looked like they had been carved by the same hand as the well. I asked you to open it and as you did a small key fell out and into the bucket. We both reached for it but it was too late the bucket swung back out of reach and plummeted down the well once more.
" The momentary qualm of ownership he experienced now was a residual feeling of his initial excitement at acquiring the place and it had never quite gone away.

What did Ralph feel when he entered his flat? 



Answer: Ralph felt a momentary qualm of ownership when he entered his flat. This means that he felt a sense of belonging and ownership when he entered his home."," The momentary qualm of ownership still besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.

What changes could be made to simplify the narrative for Grade 2 readers? Here are some suggestions:

1. Use shorter sentences. The narrative has a number of long sentences, some of which could be broken up into shorter sentences for easier comprehension. For example, the first sentence could be broken up into two shorter sentences: ""Ralph unlocked the door to his flat and entered the dark, motionless hall.""
2. Use simpler vocabulary. Some of the words in the narrative are complex, which may make them difficult for Grade 2 readers to understand. For example, the word ""besieged"" could be replaced with ""felt a little worried.""
3. Add more concrete details. The narrative could benefit from more concrete details to help readers visualize the setting and characters. For example, instead of simply saying ""his flat,"" the narrative could describe the flat's location, size, and appearance.
4. Use dialogue or action to move the story forward. The narrative is mostly exposition, which may make it feel slow-moving to young readers. Adding dialogue or action to the story could help to move the plot forward and keep readers engaged.

" The production is a triumph and I am thrilled to have the chance to see it again in London.
What does the author want to say?
The author wants to apologize for a previous unfair review of a production of Shakespeare's play Othello and to praise the exceptional quality of the production, particularly the performances of Ray Fearon and the rest of the cast. The author acknowledges that they were wrong to criticize Fearon's age for playing the title role and highlights memorable scenes, including the ones where Cassio's competitive games get out of hand and Iago begins to lose control. The author concludes by expressing their delight in having the chance to see the production again in London."," The staging is inventive and the lighting is particularly effective in creating a sense of foreboding.

For A2 learners, the following changes could be made to simplify the text:

1. Use simpler vocabulary: Instead of ""transfer,"" ""exceptional,"" ""complained,"" ""running down,"" and ""magnificent,"" use simpler words like ""move,"" ""good,"" ""say,"" ""get,"" and ""great.""
2. Break up long sentences: The text contains some long, complex sentences that may be difficult for A2 learners to understand. Try breaking them up into shorter, simpler sentences. For example, ""Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role"" could become ""I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role.""
3. Use visual aids: Consider adding images or diagrams to help learners understand the text better. For example, you could show a picture of a theater to represent the ""London stage"" mentioned in the text.
4. Emphasize key points: Highlight the most important points in the text, such as the opportunity to correct a previous review, the cast's performance, and the play's success.
By making these changes, you can help A2 learners understand the narrative more easily and enjoy the story of Othello."," The play’s themes of jealousy and racism are as relevant today as they were when the play was written and the production is a triumph.

At A2 level, the CEFR scale, the simplified narrative could be: 
Othello is a play by Shakespeare that was moved from Stratford to London. I wrote a bad review of the show when it first opened, but now I think it's great. The actor who plays Othello, Ray Fearon, is really good. I still think it's strange to have a young person play Othello, but Ray does a great job. The whole cast is great, and there are some really intense scenes, like when the young officers play games that get out of hand, and when Iago starts to lose control. "," In the final scene, when Othello realizes that Desdemona is innocent, he is so overcome with grief that he falls to his knees and weeps. The audience was deeply moved by his performance.

" But as we watched more and more lions our observations revealed a different truth: lions are solitary creatures who only sometimes cooperate for short periods of time. While it is true that lions will sometimes hunt in groups they are not the tightly knit social units we once imagined them to be. They are more like independent actors who happen to be in the same location at the same time. We have found that lions often hunt alone and only join forces when it suits them. In short they are not the highly coordinated pack hunters we once thought them to be.















































































































































































"," But the more we watched the more we realized that lions are not as coordinated or as organized as we thought. In fact the more we watched the more we realized that lions are not as good at hunting as we thought. In fact their hunting success is relatively low and their prey escape often.













































































































































































































































"," But what we found was something entirely different. What we discovered was that lionesses are the ones who do the hunting - not the males. In fact the males are often the ones who get hunted. In this instance the lioness's hunger drove her to stealthily approach her prey and then pounce. It was only after the kill that the male lion joined the feast. This discovery challenged our assumptions about the social dynamics of lions and forced us to reconsider our theories about their behavior.





























































































































































































"," But as we watched the lions of the Serengeti over and over again we realized that their hunting strategies were not all that sophisticated. In fact we found that most of their prey consisted of small antelopes and rodents. The lions were not the cunning hunters we had imagined and their social interactions were not always harmonious. They often bickered and fought among themselves and even ate their own cubs when times were tough. Our findings have made us question our assumptions about these magnificent creatures and the way we think about them in popular culture. We have come to see them as more complex and nuanced creatures than we ever imagined. 



In the Serengeti, lions hunt small animals like antelopes and rodents. They are not as smart as we thought. They fight and bicker with each other. They even eat their own cubs when they are hungry. We used to think lions were amazing hunters, but now we know they are not as good as we thought."," But what we found was far more complex than we had imagined. 





































































"," We also wanted to find out how the young lions were learning the skills necessary to survive on their own. But as the months passed we began to notice something odd. The adult lions were not working together to catch food. They were often at odds with each other and even fought over scraps. And when we examined the behavior of the young lions more closely we found that they were not learning the skills necessary to survive on their own. They were simply tagging along behind their mothers and relying on them for food and protection. Our initial excitement over the lions' hunting tactics had been misplaced. It turned out that the social harmony we had observed was actually a myth perpetuated by the lions' need to hide their true behavior from us. In short the lions were not as social as we thought they were.

























































































































"," But the more we watched the more we realized that teamwork was not always the lions' first instinct. When food was scarce the big cats tended to go solo and when they did hunt in groups it was often for reasons other than food - to protect their territory or to establish dominance. In short teamwork was not always the most important thing for lions in the wild. The popular image of lions as social coordinators was a myth perpetuated by Hollywood and romanticised by poets and travellers. In reality lions are more complex creatures with their own motivations and agendas.

Goat racing was about to begin. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village and I was fighting my way through crowds of people, ice cream trucks, and food stalls to get to a good spot to watch the race. Despite the chaos, I managed to elbow my way through the crowds and found a designated area where the goats would race.

In this narrative, the author is highlighting the limitations of relying solely on oral evidence in historical research. The author argues that the reliance on oral evidence can lead to biases and inaccuracies in the historical record, as the informant's testimony is influenced by the historian's presence and social position. The author suggests that even if the historian does not ask questions, the informant's recollection of the past is still affected by the historian's presence, and the historian's own analytical framework and biases may be communicated to the informant. The author concludes that oral history research is not without its problems and that a more nuanced approach is needed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of historical accounts.","

What do historians do? Historians listen to people who knew things a long time ago. They don't ask many questions, they just listen. But, having someone there to listen can make the person talk about the past differently. The historian might be from a different group or have a different way of thinking, which can also change what the person says. So, the historian has to be careful when listening to people and trying to learn about the past."," 










































































































































































































































































































","


In a simple way, historians are finding new ways to learn about the past. They used to rely on written records, but now they are talking to people who actually lived through the events they want to learn about. However, this method has its challenges. Just because someone tells a story doesn't mean it's completely accurate. Both the historian and the person being interviewed can be influenced by each other. The historian might unintentionally change the way the person talks about the past, and the person might also be influenced by the historian's own beliefs and ideas. So, it's important for historians to be careful and considerate when talking to people about the past."," 










































































































































































































































































































"," In other words, the historian’s past-orientedness and present-orientedness, and his or her professional training, may all be reflected in the way the informant talks about the past. The reliance on oral history is not therefore a simple matter of recording the testimony of someone who has experienced the past directly. It is a complex process that involves the interaction of many factors, and the historian must be aware of these factors if he or she is to use oral history as a reliable source of information.

" As he sat there in his office, Lancelot was aware that his presence was no longer a novelty but a constant, a fixture in the landscape of the office like a weathered boulder. And yet he could not help but feel a twinge of unease at the prospect of being so settled in his ways. For though he had long since passed the stage of needing to prove himself to anyone, he was still haunted by the suspicion that he was not quite as necessary as he once had been.

Lancelot felt a twinge of unease as he realized he was no longer seen as a novelty, but a constant fixture. He wondered if he should start taking sugar again to remind people he was still there."," The change had been so gradual he had barely noticed it himself, but the secretary had been keeping a close eye on him for months. ""I've been making Lancelot cups of coffee for many months,"" she said, as if to emphasize her point. ""It's not as if you were ever supposed to be here.""'

What is the simplified narrative for Grade 2 learners? 

Lancelot's secretary said, ""You don't take sugar, right?"" She was stating a fact, not asking a question. She had been making coffee for Lancelot for a long time, but she forgot to add sugar today because he wasn't supposed to be there. Lancelot wondered how he went from being a valuable advisor to someone who is always there and can't find a place to park when he arrives at work in the morning. He didn't know how he got to this point and how to get back to being useful again."," He had not expected to be there so much, but now he was there all the time and the secretary had to remember to ask him if he wanted sugar.'

In simpler terms: 

'His secretary said, ""Don't you take sugar?"" like she already knew the answer. She had been making coffee for him for a long time. She said she forgot because he wasn't usually there. But now he's there all the time and she has to remind herself to ask if he wants sugar.' "," He had always been a man of fixed habits, but now his habits were more fixed than ever, and he knew that the tendency to slide into lethargy had been a long time coming. But what could he do?

He tried an interactive program with his son, but it was frustrating for both of them. As a parent, I agree that play is the best way for young children to learn.

1. Use shorter sentences: Break up long sentences into shorter ones that are easier for Grade 2 learners to understand.

2. Use simpler vocabulary: Replace complex words with simpler ones that are easier for Grade 2 learners to understand.
Example: ""The things we call art, like pictures or statues, can be a problem for learning about art. That's because these things exist on their own, separate from us. But the real art is how it makes us feel and what it does to us.""

3. Use concrete examples: Give examples that Grade 2 learners can relate to, like toys or games.
Example: ""Art is like a toy that can make us happy. Just like how a toy can make you happy, art can make us feel happy too. But sometimes, the toy can be too perfect and that can make it hard to understand.""

"," A second reason why the existence of the works of art is an obstruction to aesthetic theory is that the critical method employed in the study of these works has become a tradition. Critics have been trained to apply the same tests to all works of art and the same standards of judgment are applied to all. As a result the study of art becomes routine and the freshness and originality of the works of art themselves are obscured. A third reason why the existence of the works of art is an obstruction to aesthetic theory is that the products are often too complex for the average person to understand. The artist may have intended the work to convey a certain meaning but the message may be too subtle or too obscure for the ordinary person to grasp. As a result the work of art becomes a mystery which can only be solved by a few initiates.

" But the whole project is undermined by the way in which the art works are presented. The camera lingers on the artists’ faces, while the art works are shown in quick snatches, as if the producers were afraid that if they showed the art works for too long, viewers would get bored. The result is that the viewer is left with the impression that the art is dull and uninteresting. It’s a shame because Hughes is a brilliant guide, but his enthusiasm and passion are wasted on a format that fails to do justice to the subject.


What is the main point of the narrative? 

The main point of the narrative is that television consistently fails when it comes to programs about the visual arts, particularly in terms of presenting art works in a way that is engaging and interesting for viewers. The author argues that the camera should be able to show the whole work of art and then move in close to examine the details, but instead, art programs often rely on quick snatches of footage and lingering on the artists' faces rather than the art itself. This can lead to the impression that the art is dull and uninteresting, despite the presence of a knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide like Robert Hughes.","



The article discusses why television programs about visual arts often fail. It says that TV can show a whole work of art and then zoom in to see the details, but few shows have managed to make art interesting and complex to watch. An example of what goes wrong is shown in Robert Hughes's series on American art, where Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, but he only has eight hours to introduce British audiences to art that British galleries have ignored.

































































































































































































"," But the series falls flat on its face. The production values are poor the camera work is clumsy and the editing is chaotic. The series has a tendency to drift off into areas that have nothing to do with art such as the history of American immigration.

Example: Art on TV is boring. TV can't show art like a painting or a statue. Few shows show art in a way that makes it fun to look at. Robert Hughes's show on American art is a good example. Hughes is a good critic, but the show is too long and not edited well. It's divided into parts, but some parts are too short, and it's hard to understand what he's saying.

2. Use simpler vocabulary: Replace complex vocabulary with simpler words that Grade 2"," And yet the series is a disaster. The editing is clumsy the narrative incoherent and the overall impact is one of a series of lectures that have been edited together without any thought of how they might hang together as a coherent whole. It is hard to think of a more unpromising subject than the history of art but when it comes to television programmes about art the results are consistently disappointing. Why is this? What is it about the medium that makes it so difficult to convey the experience of looking at art? Is it that the camera is a voyeur rather than an artist? Or is it that the medium is inherently incapable of capturing the subtleties of the visual experience? Whatever the reason the fact remains that television has yet to produce a truly great series on the visual arts.

Actors often face disdain and criticism from people who don't understand their craft, and sometimes they contribute to this disdain by talking about themselves and their work in clichéd or uninteresting ways. However, as the actor Paul Scofield pointed out, the true value of acting lies not in talking about it but in the actual performance itself."," The rest is talk and the less said about it the better.

I have found that the best way to keep the work alive is to approach it as if it were a task for which one is responsible, not a means of self-expression. And that is why I do not talk about my craft very much. For me, it is a mystery that cannot be explained. It is something that I must do, and that is all there is to it.

" In the beginning was the word. Language has been around for so long that it is hard to say when it started. But I believe that it began with a single individual who was the first to discover the power of language. He or she may have been able to convey thoughts and ideas to others with such clarity and precision that the others were amazed and soon they too were speaking. From then on language spread rapidly and as it grew it became a fundamental part of human nature. People no longer needed to rely on gestures or sounds to communicate. They could express complex ideas and emotions in a way that was both efficient and elegant. Language became the primary means of communication and as a result human society was transformed. People could collaborate and cooperate in ways that were previously impossible. Language made it possible to share knowledge and ideas and to solve problems together. It also allowed people to express their creativity and imagination in new and exciting ways. The power of language was so great that it could even shape the course of history. Through language people could inspire and persuade each other to do great things. They could rally armies and launch revolutions. They could negotiate treaties and make peace. And so language has played a crucial role in shaping the world as we know it today.

", Language is an invisible web of meaning that we can use to communicate with each other.

For most people the ability to speak and understand speech is automatic and unconscious. But the fact that language is so deeply ingrained in our biology doesn’t mean that it is unvarying or unchanging. On the contrary language is a highly adaptive and creative tool. It changes and grows along with the needs and experiences of the people who use it. And just as each person’s face is unique so too is each person’s language. Language is not just a means of communication.

Hooray! Something amazing has happened in London. A place called the Hayward Gallery has been changed into a place of wonder. It's not because of a big, expensive show with lots of noise and lights, but because of a special exhibition that looks at something interesting from the last 60 years. The show shows how artists have been making art that moves or thinks about movement. This has been happening a lot, even though it's not very well known."," The show features a wide variety of works by artists from across Europe, the United States and Japan, from the 1920s to the 1990s. The exhibition is curated by the Italian-born critic and historian, Germano Celant, who has dedicated himself to exploring the relationship between art and movement. He has brought together a wide range of works that show how artists have explored the idea of movement in different ways, from the optical illusions of the 1920s to the computer-controlled installations of the 1990s. The show is divided into four sections: The first section looks at the origins of kinetic art in the 1920s, when artists like Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray began experimenting with optical illusions. The second section focuses on the heyday of kinetic art in the 1960s and 1970s, when artists like Alexander Calder and Dan Flavin created large-scale installations that moved and changed with the wind and light. The third section looks at the 1980s and 1990s, when artists like Anish Kapoor and James Turrell explored the relationship between movement and perception. The final section of the exhibition features a selection of works by contemporary artists who continue to explore the idea of movement in their work.

In the 1950s, rock and roll was primarily a youth cult, but its impact on the middle class and middle-aged was seismic. It paved the way for future rock idols who listened to it in awe, aware that it would be linked to their destinies.

" The former group will be likely to take a long view of poetry as an art form, see it as a tradition to be carried on with all its formal and stylistic conventions intact and be suspicious of any departure from these conventions as a betrayal of the art. The latter will be more interested in the verbal music of poetry as an oral art, and will be likely to use a more colloquial idiom and a more direct and personal approach to subject matter. They will also be more interested in the social and political implications of poetry as a means of communication and will be more likely to be involved in the movement of the day. 
































































































































































"," The former group of poets thinks the latter group are vulgar and uncultivated and the latter group of poets thinks the former are stodgy and out of touch.

", The former group of poets are inclined to think of themselves as the defenders of a tradition of serious poetry with a long and honourable history and they are convinced that the latter group are largely responsible for the present chaos and confusion in the world of poetry. The latter group of poets on the other hand are inclined to think of themselves as the revolutionaries of the verse world and they are convinced that the former group are anachronisms who are holding back the progress of poetry and the development of the art form. As things are now the debate is likely to go on indefinitely and the two groups will continue to watch each other warily and distrustfully.," The former group thinks the latter are superficial and trivial, and the latter think the former are dull and pretentious. Neither side can understand why the other side will not see the merits of their own approach and the debate is as stalemated as it is bitter.
















































































































































































































































"," The literary writers tend to think that the popular poets are superficial and lacking in craftsmanship while the popular poets in turn are inclined to dismiss the literary writers as dull and inhibited. The debate is further complicated by the fact that there are also poets who are equally at home in both camps and who are able to move between the two with a certain degree of ease.






















































































































































































































"," The former group are critical of the latter for what they regard as their superficiality and lack of seriousness and the latter resent the former for their inaccessibility and lack of rapport with the common man. The conflict between these two groups has been going on for some time but it has been intensified by the war and the general upheaval of recent years.

"," The ‘literary’ writers feel that their art is being devalued and trivialized by the performing poets who are more interested in entertainment and audience response than in the subtlety and complexity of poetic form. The ‘popular’ poets meanwhile are resentful of the literary writers’ pretentiousness and their determination to limit the possibilities of poetry to a narrow and exclusive group of readers. In this confusion the poet who is able to reconcile the irreconcilable and to find a way of meeting the conflicting demands of the two groups may well find himself in a position of unique power and influence.

Answer: Charles Darwin thought that crying was just a weird thing that people did, but scientists now know that it's actually important for our relationships. When babies cry, it helps them connect with their mothers. As they grow up, crying can still help us feel closer to each other. But why do we still cry as adults? Maybe it's because the way we cry shows that we're feeling sad or upset, and that can help us connect with others too.

For Grade 2 learners, you can simplify the narrative by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts and using language that is easy to understand. Here's a possible way to simplify the narrative:

Advertising on trial
In the 1990s, if you worked for an advertising agency, things were tough. Many companies were struggling, and this made it hard for ad agencies to do their jobs. The recession (a time when many people lose their jobs and businesses struggle) was bad, and it lasted a long time. In Britain, for example, in 1991, the economy (GDP) didn't grow, interest rates were high, and people stopped spending money on things like toys and clothes. Many people lost their jobs, and some families lost their homes.

This simplified version of the narrative focuses on the main idea of the text, which is that the advertising industry faced significant challenges in the early 1990s due to a recession that affected many businesses and people. By breaking down the text into smaller parts and using simpler language, Grade 2 learners can better understand the content and follow the story."," 



For A2 learners, here is a simplified version of the narrative:

Advertising agencies had a tough time in the early 1990s. Many businesses were struggling due to a big economic recession. This affected many countries, including Britain, where people lost their jobs and homes were repossessed. The economic problems lasted for a long time and affected many areas of life."," The United States was not immune to the recession either. In 1991 alone unemployment soared to 7.5 percent of the workforce and over 1 million jobs were lost. The recession even affected the advertising industry which was hit particularly hard. In 1990 advertising spending in the United States had fallen by 11 percent and in Britain it had plunged by 20 percent. In short the early 1990s were a tough time to be working in the advertising business.

" The wrens are the most numerous birds in the world with over 100 species. They are tiny but fierce and they have a special place in human culture. They are associated with the underworld the dead and the afterlife. In ancient Egyptian culture the wrens were revered as messengers of the gods and they were believed to be the only birds that could fly through the underworld. In many cultures the wren is seen as a symbol of death and rebirth. And so here in the greenhouse I find myself pondering the mysteries of the wren. Is it a harbinger of something? Or just a bird in a greenhouse?

Answer: 
Human culture has long been fascinated by birds, particularly the wren. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans investigates. A bump bump bump echoes through the greenhouse as a tiny brown bird collides with the glass. It's a wren, an ominous bird associated with the underworld, death, and rebirth. Is it sending a message from a world beyond my imagination? Or is it just lost in the greenhouse? The wren is the most common bird species, with over 100 species worldwide. They are small but fierce, and they hold a special place in human culture. In ancient Egyptian culture, wrens were revered as messengers of the gods"," 










































































































































































































































































































"," The little brown shuttlecock is so small as to be almost invisible against the vastness of the universe. It's an infinitesimal thing, a mere flicker of life in a cosmic sea of darkness.

It's a reminder of the vastness of the natural world and the tiny place we occupy in it. It's a reminder of the mystery that surrounds us, and the wonder that we can never fully grasp. 

Simplified version:
Birds have been important in human culture. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports on a little brown bird that bounced against a greenhouse window. Is it a message from a far-off world or just a lost bird? The bird is small compared to the universe, but it's a wonder to me. I fear for its safety but also respect its beauty. It reminds us of the big world around us and how small we are. It also shows us there's still mystery in the world."," Paul Evans reports.

" However we have also been careless with these resources and now the consequences are beginning to show. The earth is heating up at an alarming rate and it is clear that something must be done to stop this trend before it is too late. There are many arguments about what can be done to reduce global warming but the most important thing is to take action now.
The narrative is talking about the effect of global warming on the earth and how it will affect the lives of people. It highlights how the earth is heating up and how it will have consequences for plants, animals, water, and soils. It also mentions how humans have used natural resources for their advantage but have also been careless with them, leading to the current situation. The narrative concludes by emphasizing the importance of taking action now to reduce global warming. 
The simplified version of the narrative is:
Global warming is causing the earth to heat up, which will have significant effects on the planet and its inhabitants. The consequences of global warming include changes to weather patterns, impacts on plants and animals, and the depletion of natural resources. Humans have taken advantage of these resources, but have also been careless in their use, leading to the current situation. It is important to take action now to reduce global warming and prevent its negative consequences."," But we have also learned that our activities can have unintended consequences. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which trap heat and cause the earth to warm up. This is known as global warming. We need to be concerned about this because it can have very bad effects on our planet.



































































































































































































































"," But the more we use these resources, the more we risk damaging them beyond repair.


For A2 learners, you could simplify the narrative by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Here's a possible way to do this:

1. What is global warming?
* Global warming is when the earth gets warmer.
* Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is about.
2. What might happen to the weather?
* A warmer climate means changes to the weather in all parts of the world.
* Weather is linked to the atmosphere, which is linked to the planet.
* Changes to the climate could have big effects on the weather.
3. What might happen to plants and animals?
* Changes to the climate could have big effects on plants and animals.
* Plants and animals are connected to the environment, which is connected to the planet.
* Changes to the environment could have big effects on plants and animals.
4. How might humans be affected?
* Humans use natural resources like food, water, and soil.
* If the climate changes, it could damage these resources.
* If the resources are damaged, it could make it harder for humans to live.


By breaking the narrative down into smaller chunks, you can help A2 learners understand the main ideas more easily"," But we must now learn to use them in a way that does not harm the planet.

For A2 learners, the simplified narrative could be:
Maps show how things are related on the Earth's surface. They use distance and direction to help us understand. In the past, people used time to measure distance, like 'a day's journey by river'. But this didn't give us a clear idea of how far away something is. Now, maps use numbers to show distance, making it easier for us to understand. Direction is also important, but most people just want to know 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?' so maps use simple directions like 'left', 'right', 'straight', etc."," 

Grade 2 learners can understand this text with a Flesch Kincaid Grade level of 7.5. Here is a simplified version:
Maps show how things are related on Earth's surface. They use lines and colors to show how far away things are from each other. In the past, people used to measure distance in terms of time, like ""a day's journey by river"" or ""so many hours marching."" These measurements helped people understand how easy or hard it was to cross different areas of land. But for people who are traveling, the most important thing is to know ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" So maps use simple lines and colors to show direction."," Thus early maps were simple, showing only the main features of the landscape such as rivers, mountains, and forests.

For A2 learners, the narrative can be simplified as follows:

American executives are learning from Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer. Many people in Britain know about him, but Americans only recently discovered him. Now they are reading books and watching movies about him. They are very interested in his story."," Ernest Shackleton was a people person. He was the leader of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which set off in 1914 and was intended to cross the Antarctic continent from sea to sea. The ship Endurance was his flagship, but it was no ordinary ship. It was a 50-year-old vessel that had been converted into a luxury yacht, with the finest accommodations and equipment available. The ship was even equipped with a hot water bath, a rarity even in today's standards. Despite the luxury, the Endurance was no match for the harsh Antarctic climate. The ship was crushed by pack ice and Shackleton and his crew were forced to abandon it and set up camp on the ice. The Endurance was eventually destroyed, but the crew survived thanks to Shackleton's leadership and determination. Shackleton was a people person, and his ability to inspire and motivate his crew to survive against all odds is a testament to his leadership skills. He even made sure that the crew was well-fed, despite the harsh conditions, and provided them with hot meals. He was an amazing leader, and his story is an inspiration to anyone who faces challenges in their life.





















"," Why are Americans so keen on Shackleton? Eluned Price has an explanation. 'Shackleton is a people person', she says. 'He was a leader who cared about his men, and who made sure they were safe and well-fed. He didn't just talk the talk, he walked the walk. He was the sort of leader who inspired people to follow him even when things were tough, and he was the sort of person who made people want to be around him'. The Americans, who are often criticised for being uncaring and unfeeling, are clearly impressed by Shackleton's down-to-earth humanity. Eluned Price believes that Shackleton's appeal is not just limited to America. 'People everywhere are starting to see him as a role model. He's a man who showed that leadership is not just about being in charge, but about caring for the people you're in charge of. And that's something that people can relate to, no matter where they come from'.

" They come for the spectacle the romance the drama the excitement of it all. And the music is there to provide that. It’s the glue that holds the whole thing together. Without it the show would fall flat. But it’s not just the music. The actors too have to be able to sing. And the conductor has to be able to interpret the score in a way that makes the music seem to come alive. And the director has to be able to bring all these elements together so that the audience can respond to the drama on stage. It’s a complex business and one that requires a great deal of skill and knowledge. And that’s why I now think that opera is secondly theatre. Because at its heart it is a musical art form.


Answer: 
Opera is not primarily theatre, but rather a musical art form. While theatre and music are intertwined, the music comes first, providing the glue that holds the performance together. Actors must also be able to sing, and the conductor must interpret the score to bring the music to life. The director must bring all these elements together to create a seamless performance that engages the audience emotionally. Ultimately, opera is a complex art form that requires great skill and knowledge to execute successfully."," They will sit there and listen as best they can and enjoy the sound of the music. That’s fine. But what about those who are not there to enjoy the music but to see the drama unfold? I’m afraid they are out of luck. The opera singer will be singing away as if it were a regular old-fashioned concert but there will be no drama to speak of on stage. It’s a bit of a bind really.


"," I am one of them. They are there because they enjoy the sound of it. I am there because I enjoy the theatre. 
How would you simplify the text for A2 learners?




"," But they still enjoy it. They are not there to be educated or to learn. They are there to be entertained. And so it is with theatre. People come to the theatre to be entertained not to learn. They don’t want to be bored to death by a play that is all talk and no action. They want to see something happen on stage. They want to be moved and thrilled and excited. And they want to be moved by something that is happening to real human beings not by a series of empty gestures and facial expressions.





















































































































































































", Theatres are different. In the theatre it is the actor’s voice that carries the story. In the opera house it is the music that carries the story. So if you want to engage your audience and keep them interested you have to start with the music., They come to be moved or entertained by the performance not to pick holes in it. They will enjoy the singing and the drama and the spectacle and may be moved to tears or laughter or both. But they will not be listening for the subtleties of harmony or counterpoint or orchestration. They will not be thinking of the structure of the piece or the relationship of this passage to that one. They will not be comparing the performance to a recording or a previous one. They will be experiencing the performance in the moment and enjoying it on its own terms. They will be moved by it in their own way and will leave the auditorium feeling that they have had a good night out. This is not to say that they are not open to the artistic and cultural values that underlie the performance. They may not know what a cadenza is but they know that it is something special and they may even be able to tell you why. They may not be able to name all the different types of musical instruments that are used in an opera but they can tell you that they like the sound of the harp or the flute. They may not be able to explain the significance of a particular scene or aria but they know that it moves them and that is enough. Opera is not just theatre with music added on. It is a unique art form with its own aesthetics and its own way of communicating with an audience. It, In other words they are not likely to be familiar with all the different types of musical instruments or know the difference between a concerto and a sonata. For them the experience of listening to music is a sensory one. They may or may not be aware of the structure of a piece of music but they will certainly know if they like it or not. In the theatre things are different. Here there is a clear distinction between the actor and the character they are playing. The actor is not supposed to be the character. The actor is an interpreter of the character. The character is the person who speaks the words. The actor is the person who interprets the words for the audience. There is no ambiguity about this distinction. The actor is not expected to be the character. That would be like a musician trying to be the notes they are playing. In opera the distinction between the singer and the character is not always as clear cut as it is in the theatre. The singer may be expected to act as well as sing. But even when they are not acting the singer is still the person who is singing. The character is the person who is being sung about. This is not the same as in the theatre where the actor is the person who is speaking the words. In opera the music is the thing that counts. It is what makes the performance special. It is what brings the audience to their feet. It is what makes the singer famous. The singers may

What does the author suggest about the relationship between broadcasting and modernism?
A) Broadcasting is a modernist technology that reflects the optimistic and planned growth of modern society.
B) The agricultural metaphor of broadcasting is a reflection of the industrialization of society.
C) The author suggests that the metaphor of broadcasting is inadequate for understanding the technology.
D) The author argues that broadcasting is a technology that is not centralized, but rather decentralized, and that this is reflected in the metaphor of sowing seeds broadly.
E) The author suggests that broadcasting is a technology that is not about planned growth, but rather about unplanned growth.","


What is the new technology called that was developed in the passage? 


Answer: The new technology called in the passage is 'broadcasting'.","

For A2 learners, the following simplifications can be made:

- Use simpler vocabulary: Instead of using words like 'metaphor', 'presupposes', and 'reproduction', use simpler words like 'meaning', 'assume', and 'make'.
- Break down complex sentences: The original sentence is quite long and contains several clauses. Break it down into simpler sentences that are easier to understand. For example, ""It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor, it is also one of optimistic modernism."" can be broken down into ""It means something else too, and it's a positive thing.""
- Use visual aids: Show pictures or diagrams to help learners understand the concept of broadcasting. For example, you could show a picture of a farmer sowing seeds to illustrate the original meaning of the word 'broadcasting'.
- Focus on key points: Identify the most important points in the narrative and emphasize them. For example, you could focus on the idea that broadcasting is about spreading words and pictures electronically, and that it is organized in a way that makes the agricultural metaphor seem adequate.

By making these simplifications, learners at the A2 level can better understand the narrative and its main ideas."," The answer is to be found in the social and cultural context of the time.


In what grade level would you place this narrative? Using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability test, I would place this narrative at a grade level of 8.5. Here's why:

1. Complex words: The narrative contains several complex words such as ""optimistic"", ""metaphor"", ""presupposes"", ""reproduction"", and ""centralised"". These words are beyond the vocabulary level of second-grade learners.
2. Sentence structure: The sentences in the narrative are quite long and complex, with multiple clauses. This makes them difficult for second-grade learners to follow.
3. Subject matter: The topic of broadcasting and its origins is too advanced for second-grade learners. They may not have a clear understanding of what broadcasting is or how it works.

Based on these factors, I would recommend simplifying the narrative to make it more accessible to second-grade learners. Here's a simplified version:

"," The answer is that the technology of broadcasting was shaped by social factors. The social factors were the nature of the audience and the way the audience was distributed. The nature of the audience was not homogeneous and the distribution of the audience was not random. The audience was made up of different social groups with different interests and needs. The distribution of the audience was determined by the physical location of the transmitter and receiver. The technology of broadcasting was therefore shaped by the social context in which it operated.

","

Frank Kermode is a writer who likes to think about how things are made. He wants to know how reviews are written and published. Most reviews are written quickly and then published in a newspaper or magazine. They can't be too long because there are deadlines to meet and space is limited. Also, reviews don't last very long because they are only printed in the newspaper for a day or a week at most a month. But even though they don't last long, reviews are still important because they help people decide if they want to read a book or see a movie.","


Frank Kermode examines the craft of writing reviews from the perspective of a practitioner. Most reviews are written and shared quickly, with strict deadlines and limits on their length. Once published, they are only available for a short time, like a day or a week, before they are replaced by new content. Additionally, the value of reviews is determined by their fleeting nature."," Reviews are not regarded as literature, but as a means of communication about books.


























































































































































































































































































"," Their value as literature is measured by their ability to convey information about the book they are about, not by any inherent aesthetic value. Frank argues that this kind of review-writing is not just a necessary evil, but a valuable and important part of the literary world.


For A2 learners, the following simplified narrative could be used: 

Frank Kermode thinks about how reviews are written. Most reviews are written quickly and only last for a little while. They are usually short and don't have much space in newspapers. But Frank thinks that review-writing is important and helps the literary world."," 
In this text, the author is talking about writing reviews. The author, Frank Kermode, is saying that reviews are usually written under tight deadlines and have a short life span. They are only published for a short time and then they are gone. This makes it difficult for reviews to be taken seriously because they don't have a long-term presence in literature.  




























































































































































































































"," Since they are not regarded as contributions to the body of literature, their value as works of literature is not recognised. As a result, they are not included in anthologies, nor are they subject to critical analysis.

But the movie didn't do well at the box office. Then, something surprising happened - people started talking about the movie again on TV.

"," The idea was that if you had more food available you would be more likely to eat breakfast. But it may be more significant than that. The changes in society that occurred in the sixteenth century led to a new attitude towards food and eating. People began to see food as a way to nourish the body rather than just to fill the belly. They started to eat more slowly and savour their food and this led to a greater appreciation of breakfast as a meal. By the end of the sixteenth century breakfast had become the most important meal of the day and it has remained so ever since.



"," As trade and commerce expanded the range of foods available in England increased. This meant that people could choose from a wider variety of breakfast foods including bread rolls cheese and butter. The trend towards eating breakfast spread rapidly throughout the country and by the late 1700s breakfast had become an essential part of the English day.  
Please simplify the narrative for A2 learners by:
1. Changing complex vocabulary to simpler alternatives
2. Removing unnecessary words and phrases
3. Using shorter sentences
























































































































































































"," The rising wealth and prosperity of the country meant that more people could afford to buy rather than grow their own food. As a result the traditional breakfast of bread and cheese or eggs gradually expanded to include other foods such as bacon sausages and beans. By the late nineteenth century breakfast had become a meal to look forward to. The trend towards a more varied breakfast was helped by the growth of the railway system which made it easier for people to travel further afield and discover new foods and flavours. The breakfast revolution in England was not without its challenges. Some people were sceptical of the idea of eating a meal at such an early hour and resisted the change. But gradually the benefits of a good breakfast became apparent and by the mid twentieth century breakfast had become an integral part of English culture.

"," As trade expanded and the country grew richer more people could afford to buy food rather than having to rely on home production. As a result breakfast became more commonplace and by the late 19th century it was seen as an essential part of the day's diet.


















































































































































































































































"," The population grew and the country became more prosperous so there was more to eat and more people could afford to eat. Others have suggested that the rise of the middle class and the growth of towns had something to do with it. Whatever the reason it is clear that breakfast became a staple of the English diet and a time for families to come together.
































































































































































































































"," The Tudor period saw a significant rise in the cultivation of wheat in England and the development of new technology such as the spindle mill which made bread-making easier. As a result more people had access to bread which was the mainstay of the English breakfast.
