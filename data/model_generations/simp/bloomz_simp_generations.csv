" His father used to live in the country. We had a tree. It had a name. The rest was up to my brothers and sister. For a few years we grew up around the tree. It was a lovely tree. Planting in a new land Jonallum Porritt Planting with my brother and sister I decided to plant trees in New Zealand. One of the most peculiar things which happened, and not many people know about it was it that I decided to do it because there was no more of a tree. For many people the tree was dead and the land was bare so there was not a great idea and certainly not a great deal of pride or excitement about growing it. When the first trees were grown in New Zealand, what happened was that we started a garden, a garden of trees. That was it. We never even thought in the wild that we could have begun a garden of trees. They started growing, it became an adventure. I have always loved gardening with plants and I always loved gardening with trees. It was truly a journey. Starting with one tree The plants grew and one day my brother and sister and I went out into the garden and I said, ‘What do I want to grow?’ ‘I want to grow a tree’. After that it was clear that we wanted more trees.", What is the name of the author? Jonallum Porritt. The author's parents were from New Zealand.

He planted the stake in New Zealand.," The other two children were born in New Zealand. I was the youngest, and it was actually quite amusing. We had our own little island where I did everything - gardening, planting my stake in New Zealand The trees helped form the soil and in turn form New Zealand and I never had to forget that it was my responsibility to be a part of them.

One of my brothers died in a car crash which was an enormous shock to me. I wanted to follow him so I did my homework for his college and so when I got to college I went off to be trained as a pilot. There’s a certain kind of pride in having your own stake. No matter where you are you should have your own stake, so even if I was on a foreign mainland I still got to have my own stake in New Zealand."," I grew up in the country with my brother and sister and so it’s pretty natural. I don’t even remember when I went back to the country because I was so happy. I remember just the fact that we were with my parents on a boat and on the way home they said ‘you’ve done quite well Jonallum’ and I said ‘not so well my dear, you could do worse than well, you’re a genius!' John was the original. I took over after him, my brother. We got the idea to plant trees. That was the idea my mother had when she said we could look after this garden.

 I didn’t recognise the sounds they made but when they walked away I knew they were cute little bug zappers. The badgers I saw at my farm in Somerset were the only living animal I ever saw. But this is what they look like and their arrival has been a welcome addition to my farm.," I did not recognise them and as I put on my best clothes and a hat I realised they were baby badgers. The little things were no bigger than a golf ball and I couldn’t recognise them. I told everyone who asked to come to inspect them but no one was a match. My husband was quick to laugh and said, “Look, they’re cute but they aren’t you”."," They were our youngest of the year.’ — Louise, British Farmers Union (BFU) I came into contact with Louise and her husband Derek"," This is not a typical description of a badger and the way that I describe it, it’s not the same as what my husband or some local people described earlier. I am surprised that this is what they think of us. They thought it was great fun to watch us catch them in the summer when they were running about but, when we moved in to our new house in January, we didn’t have time for them. This is not the way we do things. You had better not try this on your own. We warned you. ‘BADGER CUBs’ were the first words we used when we opened our doors to the world on our farmland in Somerset. At first the little guys were tame, although they would often try to bite your hands off and you would often get bit yourself in the process. Luckily, we had a number of helpers who were able to catch them to take to the farm for feeding — and the badgers have since become very sociable. The badger cubs are in good condition, healthy and happy. We hope to have them tamed one day so that they can be released in the wild."," In fact, you could almost mistake them for little human babies — but that’s not the reason I hadn’t recognised them. As the mother held them together, I heard the curious cries of: ‘Stay here. Stay here! Stay here!’ — she had no time to put them down. BIRTHDAY REVEAL The surprise at our guests’ arrival came as we put the badgers together again, with some of their own children having arrived by our neighbours' dairy cows to play. They all looked thrilled, including a young couple who arrived the day after the badgers' birth. BIRTHDAY REVEAL Our guests were given cake and a present. And in their eyes, the real surprise of the night was the birthday celebration for our badgers, whose big day was celebrated with a party and cake."," ‘They’re dead’ I said to Derek. ‘No, they’re not’ he replied. ‘They look quite fresh and healthy.’ They were. They looked healthy and fresh, and their food was growing fast."," This entry was first published on April 6, 2012. In the CEFR Scale, this activity is assessed as A2.

" Publisher B Reviews are crucial for some types of books, but not others - it's not so much the number of reviews you have but the quality and the relevance of the reviews.

Publisher D Reviews have had an extremely positive effect for books. This is mainly for books we do publish. Publisher E Not very much."," Publisher B Books sell more books when there are reviews, but only if they are positive reviews. If the book gets a negative review, the sales fall slightly. Negative reviews may lead to less sales. Publisher C Books sell more books when there are negative reviews, but only if they are negative reviews. Positive reviews actually cause more sales. Publisher D Books sell more books when there are positive reviews. Negative reviews cause a slight increase in sales. Publisher E Books sell more books when there are negative reviews.

They also think that the amount of reviews has a similar effect on sales as before but they argue that reviews are also an important ingredient in the success of books. Publisher C Most publishers find that reviews have an effect on sales, but this varies according to the book. The amount and quality of reviews can be crucial to selling certain books. Publisher D Many authors will do reviews and sell books if they're well reviewed but not usually, with a few exceptions Publisher E Publishers usually think reviews have an effect on sales"," Publisher B There is less effect on sales when reviews go against books - as the publishers have no incentive to say 'this is a bad book we sell'. The effect depends largely on the way reviews work. The effect on sales when reviews don't work is negligible. Publisher C As with publisher B no effect when reviews go against books but this effect varies by genre. Publisher D There is no effect on sales when reviews go against books but when reviews work the effect on sales is fairly large. Publisher E No effect when reviews go against books - although reviews often get some sales if there is a strong enough buzz, but there has not been any reliable evidence that these reviews lead to sales. Publisher F There is no effect on sales when reviews don't work and no effect on sales when reviews do work."," Publisher B As the review was the only trigger for sales for most of its first quarter of the year our book selling was off a lot, although that is due to the very poor start to the year. Publisher C Books that had their reviews in the front of the bookshelf have sold out of shops after only a few weeks but publishers can find many ways of making sales. Publisher D Books reviewed in the front of the shop are generally sold out of shops much sooner than those which have not had any reviews. Publisher E As the review system is very much an extension of the advertised information the publisher would advise that readers read the reviews before they decide to buy. Publisher F Books which have not had any reviews have been poorly reviewed and are therefore usually not recommended to young children."," Publishers B Reviews mean less - they have never had to pay any attention to what critics had to say, and don't see the point of critics anyway. A Publisher B They say reviews have had a detrimental effect on sales but say they just pay and they don't need to be convinced that they are worth their money (a publisher says it's not worth our time). Authors B Reviews are a very difficult thing to sell because most authors don't have any self-interest in promoting their book. Publisher C Reviews are important but they also say that they're not a guarantee of a sale. Publisher C Reviews help sell a book if you're an accomplished author, but it's up to the author to decide whether it is really worth their time and effort. Publisher D Reviews are important to sales as long as they're appropriate. All of these publishers said that reviews help sell books, and all said that the reviews are worth their money. Publisher D The effect of reviews on a book's sales may be less significant than publisher D."," Publisher B Reviews are also important to publishers - the second part of the newspaper we turn to.

" Kenyan runners have offered me a warm welcome. 'They were like brothers and sisters who had come for me,' Richard Nerurkar told me after the trek."," Nanyuk - Kenyans, Mount Kenya and me It's hard to believe, but I had first met these runners in London. Richard Nerurkar"," Richard Nerurkar was with me in Nanyuk. His training had to start at Mount Kenya. After arriving we were immediately welcomed by the locals who were preparing a special meal. In the meantime they gathered around a stove and started to talk. It was clearly a social gathering and I was struck how eager they were to get to know me. They all laughed and chatted at once, and I got to know them better. After the meal everyone had to stand together to make a big circle in the Nanyuk grass. After that, I started running."," While running at Kenya's highest point I had my first taste of the home country and Kenyan training methods. It was a revelation. As we left Nanyuk for our training the Kenyan team and I chatted about our expectations for the Kenyan season. I didn't expect so many runners to come back home, so many from Kenya to run, and so many runners to train with. I had never experienced this before. At home I run with the British Olympic team, so I'm used to seeing hundreds of runners at the same time training every Sunday. But here in Kenya, there is hardly anyone in a million that meets that requirement. On my last training run in Nanyuk the Kenyans offered a special challenge to myself: a half-marathon. In the run, a group of runners ran with the Kenyan team and one of my fellow Kenyans competitor. As we left the base we were asked to perform our final push of the training run. That was quite unusual for me, as in my home country I usually finish my training run first. It meant to prove the Kenyans right - you are welcome to share the hard yards of a run, it is for the benefit of the team.", On this one my training partner was Kenyan runner Richard Nerurkar. We started by jogging together in the city and later we took on the challenge of a half marathon together. The good news is that Richard came to Nanyuk in my own limousine. The bad news is that he was on a date with his girlfriend! The Kenyan team and Richard were training together for the marathon.," In this country I had been so often forced to take just the training I could get. As we walk on to the base camp I can see the local runners who will be sharing the food and warm clothes for the next two weeks. They will have been competing in the Kenyan Cross Country Championships held the day before last in the highlands, which is when I spent most of the week training.

 Mass marketing is an expensive exercise which is unlikely to succeed. Advertisers have tended to underestimate what it costs to market an interesting and unique offer to a targeted audience.," Advertisers feel that they are the only ones who know how to advertise for mass markets, and they will do whatever they can to get their products in front of as many people as possible. Advertising should be aimed at consumers and not mass markets. The truth is mass marketing is an illusion. In the 21st century we are starting to see the decline of mass marketing AS IN THE 19TH CENTURY In the 19th century marketing was concerned with individual, localized and specific markets. People had to pay local rates to get power and light. The 20th century, the golden age of mass-market marketing, saw the proliferation of brand names. It was only in the 21st century that people started to notice the decline of mass marketing.", The good news is that mass advertising has produced big business but it has also produced some very sad results. A good example of some of the sadness is Nike. Nike's business has been very successful but it also produced terrible advertising. Nike's business has been very successful but it also produced terrible advertising.," If it's not mass marketed then there's no money!

The author gives an example of a product that has become a hit. Hit and miss of mass marketing As almost everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertisers like to think in terms of mass markets and mass media but as brands and media have proliferated target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences but they rarely are. The lack of creativity is another problem.

" So I went for a career in journalism, but I found I wasn’t the journalist I wanted to be. That is, I wasn’t any more interested in what was going on in the world. The internet was launched in the mid-1990s. After having had a long career break from journalism, Georgina was not in a position to return to her profession but knew that she needed to change her perspective."," I had been through a period of downtime and needed a change. If I were to make the change, I must first have the opportunity to go back to school and I decided that the course I had been looking for was called Home Energy. Home Energy was a course in home efficiency which I attended on a full-time basis and the money earned from my work was spent on upgrading and remodeling the family home and it worked! I am now a working journalist and my passion is to share the knowledge I have learned - and now you too can enjoy the advantages of an energy efficient home for a fraction of the cost."," This was the time when I decided that I would spend the next four years on the subject of the plugs, taking notes and photographs in the process.

I spent the Christmas after last year trying to write a piece about how technology had changed our lives in the last half-century and I felt I had succeeded in transforming the family home into an efficient workplace.," Luckily my husband and I had agreed to sell our family home and I could turn it into a space for my craft.The house wasn’t the place for it as I had left it unfinished and there were many walls that needed to be painted and trimmed and that was all taking up the time which was necessary to build a new career as a journalist. I knew then that it was time to start working on that home. I needed an answer so the next year I bought a vacuum cleaner, a hair dryer, a box of tissues and a box of glue.

ART IS IN FINE GREAT FOR ARTISTS AND ENTERTAINERS"," Hint hint: Only a handful of genes can control the ability to make art, this implies that in a human with no genes left to make art (like a chimp) there is likely no talent to express in any manner."," This means that the development of any significant human feature in art is likely to lag far behind other species. Humans in the past were excellent painters, writers, musicians, astronomers, thinkers, scientists, and architects - all abilities that will remain as important as ever. No one has had time to develop differences from chimpanzees."," One can say this is why: In the world wide human population only a tiny percentage of them will become master artist. On the other hand the world wide animal population would have an enormous advantage if they were more numerous. In many cases this difference is not clear-cut and depends on individual characteristics. For example, chimps who are highly skilled in the use of tools are more fit to be hunters and not artists. So the natural talent for art in humans is extremely limited and there are many environmental factors involved in its development. Many of them can be controlled by the artist.

" This idea is supported by the fact that sleep loss is costly to our body. For those who sleep less, they need to be put through more expensive medical treatments than those who sleep more. The next theory explains that sleep is a form of self-refreshing. For people who are sleepy, it can be seen as a restful way to relax and recharge.

He insists that our sleep is a form of rest. We get a rest when we sleep. He argues that the body is often used up physically when we go to sleep and therefore a rest is needed to recover. This theory is also widely popular and suggests that sleep provides rest for the mind and spirit. Physiological Theory, The second theory states that we sleep to make up for the missing sleep we have during the day. This theory holds that our body is programmed to try and make up for the fact that we sleep less during the day than at night.," Sleep is vital, but the purpose of sleep is still debated.

 What is not clear is whether a writer is a ‘writer’ or a ‘speller’. Spelling errors in a ‘writer’ would be rare or entirely absent.," In other words, a good writer will not want to spend as much time as he does writing with his hands. This is especially true of creative writers. The computer keyboard is a sloppy one. In contrast, the mouse is much more refined."," In effect, the brain is not in control of the hand. Dr Johnson's view is correct, in that good writing is hard - to produce, and hard to read.", The ease of the computer is too much for the human brain to adjust.

If a word is too long, the Flesch-Kincaid grade scale drops it to a F or below F", Writing by hand vs. On screen: Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. I am sure the reason was that they were physically hard to write. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain. What would be difficult to alter or erase was written with care. The casual facility of the computer leads to sloppiness. Most writers using word processors find the time spent correcting early drafts more or less equates with the time originally spent on handwritten text

 Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born scientist who was one of the leading scientists of the 20th century and in particular he is considered one of the most important of all time. Albert Einstein's name is not well known to most people because he was not the first man to solve a scientific problem that they have seen. A large number of people recognise him because he is the face of a product advertising some of their favorite intellectual products.," There were many great scientists before Einstein in the 20th century, but he changed their way of looking at the world by his theories that were not just a step up but made possible new scientific knowledge.", He had the brain of a robot His theory of relativity was famous because it was outlandish and contrary to common sense. Einstein was one of the greatest scientists of all time His theory was known for contradicting everyday experience., Einstein's theories were the foundations of modern science. No one should put someone on a pedestal or make their achievements a cause celebre. Albert Einstein," There are three things we know of Albert Einstein: 1) he developed ‘relativity’ 2) he is considered a genius and 3) he is a scientist. For the purposes of this article, we will be explaining to a CEFR A2 learner what Albert Einstein is.

Einstein wasn't a scientist who lived in the 19th century. He was a scientist who lived in the 20th century. If you can't answer his name quickly, ask someone who's smart enough to know something about the history of science. Albert Einstein", Scientists and engineers had been searching for the force that connects the universe through a scientific model where matter was understood as a set of particles and the forces of nature were used as a kind of description system.
" The need for accurate colour coded field maps of galaxies was always present. The amateur astronomer was always looking for the best possible view, but few have managed to do so in the past few decades."," The scope has also widened from stars and galaxies, to planets, stars and other celestial objects. Many more things can be discovered. The future has not yet come into view, but the possibilities are great. The best thing about the golden age of amateur astronomy may be that there was no scarcity of charts and catalogues."," In the 1960s a man may not have had a car, yet today one can buy almost any model from a budget model to a high-tech car, although few people have cars of their own."," There are fewer observatories, fewer books, less advanced equipment and fewer people capable of conducting observational astronomy.

Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results. All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well perhaps but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago.

It is difficult to separate these two worlds. Because it is difficult to describe the relation of an original and a copy it is difficult to separate the medium of art and the copy of the medium from the original. The media of today are so powerful that art becomes a copy and the imitation. Because the art is copied too many of the works are unrealistic caricatures."," You see an artist as if he was in the middle of a battle between the stars and the devil. The artist of yesterday is the artist of today - the artist of today is a good omen - a good omen for what we say is art. The art of today - is art of yesterday, if not today.

" Crying was once a human universal, but it may have been selected against during evolution. The role of crying in development suggests that its use as a tool in human communication is much older than previously thought.", People cry to express emotion. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness. However the persistence of crying into adulthood is harder to explain. It seems that the sound of crying becomes considerably less important than the visual signal it conveys, Children’s crying can have several purposes. It may simply be a form of expressing helplessness. In a few cases it may indicate feelings of pain (such as pain of separation). It can also help to establish social bonding with others., Crying often accompanies the distress of the baby or child. It is usually expressed during distress and loss. Tears can be used to express social and psychological feelings. Crying may have been advantageous in the early human communities.," OWN-INSIGHT John Bowlby - The crying infant and the baby's care in childhood . Child care experts have found that the crying infant's crying, and the cries of babies, have social significance. According to Bowlby the infant cries when it needs social support to develop its sense of security, identity and self-worth. Bowlby explained that the infant cries because it has experienced some loss or distress, and it is trying to communicate to its caregiver that it needs help.  Infant crying serves as an outlet for distress or as a way of expressing emotion. When the child is born, he has an immediate and clear need for security and care. Young infants do not have any control of these needs. As the child grows up, its primary source of security is the adult caregiver. At the same time, however, infants need to explore and learn about its world. Bowlby suggests that the crying infants are not necessarily expressing helplessness and hopelessness. Rather, the crying infant may express attachment to its caregiver, as well as its anxiety. Child crying is probably the oldest form of communication with human beings and is used in almost every culture.", the sound of crying becomes considerably less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness, Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolutionary purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child.

Blogging: Confessing to the world Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth!", There are many ways to advertise Our whereabouts and Wealth - the first of which is by blogging.

 But this is a story that most of us have never heard of. If you had worked in one of the companies which were struggling at the time you probably have not been offered a job as part of their current strategic plan that could not be sold to the client in advance of the job being done. A similar example took place during the early 1990s for the advertising industry where the recession hit in Britain at the beginning of the period. A well-known advertiser told me that he and his team had been working on a new campaign to be shown on UK television stations at the beginning of the new year in 1991. One of the advertisements was not acceptable to the client because of its content (the subject matter) at the time. The advertisement was not accepted because it was too controversial. They had never seen it before. And there was no way to sell it. The client had been with the company for 20 years. They were also desperate. In that case a successful campaign was able to be launched after a change in management., Business as usual In 1991 the recession was just beginning. And if I could only give one example of the impact this had on British advertising I would suggest that advertisers and agencies alike were on the lam. In a country where advertising is a mainstay of the economy and a major source of income even the most optimistic people would have expected that the advertising sector would have survived the downturn. In fact most of the big advertising agencies survived relatively unscathed. In their eyes they were simply doing what they always had done — being business as usual. But that was just what they never did. They were looking for new ways to survive the downturn. And one of those ways was to adopt advertising that was almost on trial in the US at that time. And that's why so many advertising agencies and some companies of big companies had offices in that country. It would make a good advertisement What advertisement could not make a good advertisement? Answer not in context," During this period of widespread economic hardship in Britain, people started to look for ways to earn money quickly. So many began to take up the job of making money quickly by getting advertisements onto people's homes or bodies in ways which you may not have thought of."," It meant that people who were employed were the subject of a two sided competition between their bosses and potential competitors. Those employers who did well saw their employees be placed in a new, often less skilled environment. Those who did badly were laid off or had their contracts revoked. AdWords The advent of the internet in the 90s was seen as a threat by some companies, but for others the advent of the internet was as a chance for their customers to find more affordable advertisements which paid better."," In the US the recession had a similar impact and the same recovery period was much shorter but there was enough pain to last. Advertising, too, may well have been tough. The recession in 1990-91 had been worse than anticipated and lasted for the length of time contemplated by most.", In many parts of the country this was seen as a catastrophe. Businesses ran into crisis as they feared it. Total words Total sentences Total syllables 4100," Adverts placed during that period had a strong effect on consumer behaviour and were viewed as being honest, direct and clear. A simple example is a branded wine for which interest was particularly high, one whose advertising had a deep effect on consumer behaviour.

" So why this particular bird is a symbol of so much of human culture.

 These people love this or that particular piece of music more than the rest and they will pay to hear it. I am a performer not a scientist.," But the word and the actors speaking it will remain for me very highly significant. If you are into opera you better get there at 9 or 10pm on a Tuesday. It goes on until four in the morning, and as a rule you won’t get on to it until your head is in the clouds (no pun intended).", We are the audience and for us the words speak loud and clear in contrast to the musically literate and the ones whose ears are more used to classical or operatic music., They are left sitting in the sidelines waiting to be told what the actors say as if they had to believe every word and that they had been given no instruction in any art form other than to look at a stage set and listen to the music. I think the opera has come a long way from its origins as something that really was theatrical and musical in nature., It may be that they don’t understand what is being sung because it is not their world. I don’t really care because this is what we enjoy. Music and entertainment is not about the people who have academic training and technical knowledge.," I prefer the theatre style in my view. There are certain parts of the music, such as those that require a high degree of technical manipulation and the use of a great number of effects, which I think is silly. The musical scores are usually presented to me as written music. Some music is quite beautiful. But the music for the singing is usually not the music that people are used to hearing. I would choose music written by a composer based on the musical score and the actor or the actor and the director acting", Those are left to listen and admire as long as I myself can enjoy what I am hearing. Entertainment is important. Music is important. Musical performances in an opera house are a very good experience.

There was also a revolution in how fast food was developed and available., However other factors have been put forward for its introduction.

A good breakfast is the key to a good morning.," In a country like England breakfast is a relatively new arrival. In the sixteenth century it became the norm not the exception. Admittedly there are scattered references to travellers having a meal at dawn before embarking on arduous journeys and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without unless they were monarchs or nobles.
