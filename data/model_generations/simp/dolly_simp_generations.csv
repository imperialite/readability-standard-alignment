" Everyone was so busy, the noise was overwhelming and I felt intimidated and out of place. It was a bit scary too. Cindy seemed so calm though, it was like she could multitask and juggle all of her work and friends and social engagements so easily. Her energy was infectious - I felt like I could easily do what she was doing. So we set a day to swap and the morning of the day we swapped our lives, we went to the restaurant and enjoyed a nice breakfast together - chatting and laughing. Then we went to the apartment building where Cindy works and she introduced me to the complex. I felt a bit anxious but also relieved to be in a new environment and meeting new people. We went up to Cindy's floor, pressed the button and I'm happy to report that it worked - Cindy was able to switch places with Amanda! A. Cindy’s story It was like a dream. I walked up to the reception desk, showed my ID to the guard, and it was all so surreal and magical. I could not believe I was now Amanda! I went to the elevator and pressed the button, but I wasn't ready to step into the new life. I took a deep breath, whispered a prayer and pressed the button. A rush of adrenaline flooded my body as I stepped out of the elevator and into the new life. I was so overwhelmed, I almost didn't realize where I was and what had just"," I was glad the manager had told us not to bring our daughter, because she’d just have been in absolute chaos. But the manager was so vague we didn’t know what the rules were. It was definitely a weird experience. The food was expensive and mediocre at best - but that didn’t matter. It was the thrill of the adventure that got to me. The two of us had been friends for years, but in this new version of ourselves we felt like we were meeting new people in a way I'd never felt before. I knew Cindy would say that she wouldn’t be able to do this with her daughter around, but in our new selves, we both told ourselves that one day we’d be a mother ourselves and could do it then. We didn’t realise we’d left until we got to Cindy’s house. And I was so glad we’d brought cash too - we were relieved to see that it was the end of the holiday for Cindy! She’d had such a brilliant time and we’d both felt like we’d lost a friend but found a new best friend. And my kids were over the moon too - they hadn’t realised we’d even been away. They asked for hugs and kisses, and then I made us an impromptu dinner with some leftovers. But now Cindy and I’m glad we’d thought to bring some chilli - our"," 

Amanda: ""The first thing I noticed was how clean it was - everywhere was sparkling clean and all the staff were smiling. The food was nice too - very good quality. We ordered our drinks and when they came up, I could see straight away that this was much more appealing. So, we went up to the bar and started chatting to the guys there, which was easy. We chatted them through their drinks, they were lovely, and I even got a text through my phone that I couldn’t believe! It was a very nice, enjoyable evening and I didn’t realise how much I’d been missing the vibrant nightlife and great restaurants. The next day I got a text that my friend had swapped lives with me and I realised I was totally out of it and it was actually quite fun to go along with a different way of looking at things for a change. I was a bit worried I would feel out of it but once I started to get my bearings again, it was all very smooth sailing from there. My friend and I had a nice long chat after Amanda had been discharged back to her regular life. 

Cindy: ""I was amazed that I actually enjoyed it - I felt calm and relaxed. I had a nice long chat with Amanda about her thoughts and feelings before the swap too - it was so easy to talk to her and I loved it. I did notice that for a while I was having to work really hard"," I'm a bit of a shy person so I felt a bit out of place. Cindy’s story We found our coats and stepped into the main entrance. It was quite busy but everyone was very friendly and we were quickly shown to our table. My first order of business was to choose a drink from the menu. I'd ordered wine which Amanda had also ordered on the internet. However, as I selected the wine I noticed the price was slightly more than usual. My wine arrived and I was a bit nervous to order it but Amanda said the menu was fairly obvious so I ordered a medium red. As we waited for our drinks we took a stroll around the restaurant to see if there were any celebrities we could spot. A couple of times we passed a famous person entering the restaurant but they were quickly ushered away. As we finished our drinks and started to discuss what we wanted to eat we noticed that our bill was more than we’d expected. I noticed the prices were all slightly more than usual too. After looking on the internet we decided to order the tasting menu so we could try a range of different food to see if we liked it. The menu was pretty complex - there were several different options of each dish with lots of different sauces, dressings and garnishes. It really took us a while to decide and at first we weren’t convinced this was a good idea - we thought it might be too complicated but the more we thought about it the more it appealed"," When I first walked in, my friend Cindy and I looked at each other in confusion - where are we? Where are they? We didn't know where to go. People were pushing and shoving - it was chaos. But my Cindy knew exactly what to do. “Amanda - follow me - take my hand,” she said. I looked around - no one was listening to us, we were totally lost. “Just walk straight ahead - don’t look where you’re going - just follow me, and don’t look back” she said as she pulled me away from the crowd and led me along a different path. “Oh my god! This is amazing - I feel so free” I told my friend Cindy. I was amazed at the number of stairs we had to climb, and even more amazed at what I saw when we got to the top. There was a huge panorama of the city - it was so beautiful. But the most beautiful thing about the city was the people; everyone was so happy and smiling. We didn’t want to leave. “This is great - we’ve had a lovely time but we’d better go. Thank you so much Cindy” I said as we turned to go. I watched my friend Cindy head back into the throng of people to go about her business. But all of a sudden I felt a hand grab my shoulder. “Amanda, wait - would you come"," This is why I suggested we go for a drive instead. I'm so looking forward to not being here any more, I'll be able to get to know Cindy all over again! Cindy's story My day began with a bit of a shock. I was expecting Amanda to be someone I’d never met, but when my turn came I found out she was the old me. I was surprised and confused but decided to act as if nothing was wrong. Things were pretty chaotic when we arrived so we split up to cover more ground. As I explored the place I started to wonder what I’d done wrong. The food was terrible and everything was so expensive. I realised I’d made a terrible mistake when Amanda turned up. I was horrified to discover I was dining with the past! I fought hard to regain control of the situation and was successful. I got everyone to their seats and brought out the champagne. It was a close-call but I got the hang of it. Amanda and I had a great evening and I got to know her daughters better. Cindy and I agreed a date for our next swap life reversal. The perfect ending to a fun day! It was a pleasure to be able to swap lives with someone for a day. It was interesting to meet Amanda, who is the person I’m used to being, but it was also interesting to know her daughters better – they’re both so beautiful! And to be able to experience London –"," It was overwhelming but such a relief once we were in and I knew Cindy wouldn’t get too drunk. The waiter took our order, I ordered a glass of white wine and a pint of ale. We started with appetizers, I asked if she had any of her own. She said there were some chips in the kitchen and that she’d fetch them. She returned with about eight pieces of chips, which I wolfed down in a few big chunks, before I realized I’d left the kitchen. I returned with about 10 rashers of bacon and three rashers of streaky bacon, which she cut up and added to the chips. Then, because I’d ordered a pint of ale, I had half a pint for myself. I asked for some ketchup too. I also asked what she was going to drink, and she said she’d have a pint of their house lager. She’d only have half a pint herself to make it fair. I’d had a couple of glasses of wine earlier but was hoping to have more. We’d been chatting and learning about our friends’ lives, but had started with some general topics to avoid getting too deep into conversation about ourselves. I asked her what she’d missed. She said she’d been at home, and said her youngest daughter had done the Easter holiday, which she’d done, as well as her son who’d been at college since the beginning of the"
" Yet many people know the name of my test. The answer is: Dorothy Hodgkin has had an enduring influence on British nuclear physics and medicine. Some even say that 'there was a piece of her in everyone'. I am the first person to have written a book about Dorothy Hodgkin. That is why her name is now so familiar to people in Britain. Her victory at the 1955 Nobel prize ceremony changed the course of both nuclear physics and medicine in both countries. It was she who laid the groundwork for a new discipline which became known as Condensed Matter Theory of Nucleic Acids - a name which remains attached to her name to this day. She worked with nuclear physics and medicine on a grand scale. She was part of the team that built the first artificial heart. Later, she helped develop the world's first effective chemotherapy for the treatment of leukaemia. To this day, people who suffered from leukaemia continue to look to her for guidance. It is precisely this kind of legacy that has made Dorothy Hodgkin such a fascinating figure in modern British history. I don't know the answer to why people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin. I am still searching for the answer. But if someone told me one day I would become the subject of a book, I would be more than content. It is a shame that such a brave and charismatic woman has received so little recognition in her own country.

I am Georgina Ferry - a"," But it isn't. Dorothy Hodgkin was a trailblazer and her accomplishments will go unrecognised unless I can inspire people to know her. So every day I subject friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test: I tell them that I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin and I remind them of her accomplishments. 

As the narrator of this story, I will ask my friends and acquaintances to read this section and then pass the test themselves, by telling me what they think. Dorothy Hodgkin was a British biologist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949. She studied and purified a chemical called A23187, which is used in medical research today to stimulate cells. In so doing she helped found the field of cell biology and is credited with numerous other discoveries. 

Dorothy Hodgkin was the second female doctor to qualify in the United Kingdom and the only woman to win a Nobel Prize, which she shared with Peter Medawar, a Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine in 1950. Despite her impressive record of achievements, Hodgkin is still largely unknown in her home country and in other parts of the world. 

This lack of knowledge isn't purely down to the fact that I have to go out of my way to find people who know about Hodgkin. Nor is it just down to me having to remind my friends and acquaintances of her accomplishments. The real answer is"," But it's not, and now I'm going to tell you about her. Dorothy Hodgkin was born in 1910 and as a child, like so many British children of her time she suffered under the tyranny of the nursery rhyme ""Jack Sprat and his wifePSCOOK"". ""Jack Sprat"" of course was the greatest of British cooks and his wife, Mrs. Pritchett, was a parlorer. When Dorothy's mother was a child, her father would say to the guests, ""Now, Mrs. Sprat and Mr. Pritchett, I would like you to meet my daughter, Dorothy."" And the Pritchetts would introduce ""Miss Dorothy Hodgkin"" to the dinner party as a polite and necessary way to introduce a daughter to her parents. In school, Dorothy Hodgkin also suffered under the tyranny of the ""four Fs"" which were: Form, Facts, Format and Fancy. ""Form"" as in ""Form a circle,"" was her motto as a young scientist. ""Facts"" as in the formula F = MA, where F is force, M is the molar mass and A is the atomic weight, was also challenging as she often needed to demonstrate her knowledge of these facts to the teachers or to peers. ""Format"" as in her high school's newspaper, The Daily Arbiter, was ""Formidable"" and she was made editor. ""Fancy"" as in ""the french"," But sadly it isn't. The problem is that, like many women who have won a Nobel prize, she is largely forgotten now that she has finished her career. This is why the Dorothy Hodgkin test is so important to me. When I ask people what I am working on they often say something like 'you are working on your thesis', which sounds impressive. But I know this is not the case. My thesis will be written some time in the future and it doesn't exist yet. So the Dorothy Hodgkin test requires me to invent a life for Dorothy Hodgkin. I tell people that she is a biographer, specialising in biographies of women who have been successful in their careers. This is exactly what she is: a biographer who has been successful in her career. I then ask them what they remember about her. Often what they say reminds me of something I read in an encyclopaedia or heard on the news, but I dig out a photo of Dorothy and show it to them. They often recognise her but only in the middle of her hair which I have shorn in a style popular in the 1960s. A few pass the test but many more fail. Why does the Dorothy Hodgkin test work? It works because biographies of successful women are rare so when someone tells me what she is working on I am very excited. I feel a bit guilty, though, because this is a woman I would really like to know more about"," A woman: she was an amateur radio operator and, as one of only two women at Manchester University at the time, a volunteer ambulance driver at the first World War. But more to the point, Dorothy Hodgkin won the Nobel Prize in 1945 for her work on the structure of the atom. She is famous for coining the term ""proton"" and for helping discover the structure of the atom in the process of studying the behaviour of atoms in a strong magnetic field. She has received several more awards, including the British Empire Medal and a CBE. Despite all this she has little known outside of Britain. I think it is down to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. I have been giving it out for the past four years and despite the lack of enthusiasm on the part of friends and acquaintances who receive the email invitation to take part I keep carrying on with the test. I would encourage other Brits to sign up too, because the same is likely to be true of the many other scientists and scholars who have won Nobel prizes. We must try to promote their work and name-spot them lest they be forgotten. A2


Georgina Ferry is a British science writer who specializes in biographies and popular science. She has recently started using the Dorothy Hodgkin test in her research and writing and now regularly asks friends and acquaintances for their opinions. To date, she has successfully tested 10 friends and acquaintances. Among the positive responses, she received: ""Sure"," But it isn't. It turns out she was just one of hundreds of scientists of all nations who won the Nobel prize during the second World War. So the Nobel prize doesn't necessarily make you famous. But it does make you a person and in 1945 there weren't many people in the world who had the power to save many thousands of Jews. She did that. We don't know her name in the same way that we don't know who won the war. But we should all try to do our bit to ensure she becomes better known. Here is one way. Read her biography and tell me what you think. Dorothy Hodgkin test The Dorothy Hodgkin test is very simple. You are asked to work out what the researcher is working on and, even if they are not yet at the stage where they can present the work to a scientific audience, they should be able to tell you at least what part of the body the experiment is being carried out on, the word ""brain"" still appears on the door to many lab rooms and you can often find Dorothy Hodgkin's brain on display in the same lab. For example, the Dorothy Hodgkin test that I am about to conduct is as follows: ""I am working on the heart and I can tell you it beats at the left of the woman's brain."" 
We know Dorothy Hodgkin's work for the past couple of days because I have been going round London telling people what I am working on"," But the sad fact is that this esteemed accolade seems to have been rather more forgotten by the general public than might be expected. In an era when gender and ethnicity are often seen as more significant markers of scientific achievement than hard numbers, Hodgkin's remarkable career was anything but typical. She began her work in theoretical physics aged 17, becoming one of the leading lights of the fledgling quantum theory and a pioneer of electron theory. Her genius lay in her creative use of mathematics, physics and chemistry to solve problems, to find new theories and test their validity, her name and work will long be remembered in the history of physics and chemistry. 

Her early career was also clouded by controversy. She was one of several women at the start of their careers at Imperial College in London in the 1920s who found themselves the subject of negative comments in the press. But this proved to be a turning point in her development as a scientist and it did little harm to her career that she was also one of the first to take up and benefit from the opportunities created by the rise of women scientists. In this way she was able to work alongside and in some cases challenge men for many years. She published extensively, had an unusually high number of doctorates conferred on her (over 30) and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1946, the first woman to achieve this honour. Hodgkin was a key member of the team that won the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine"
" In other words, she is the first artist to actually succeed in painting herself into existence. Her latest exhibition at the prestigious Victoria & Albert museum is testament to her growing acclaim within the fine arts community and the general public: The Connoisseur's Manifesto. Janson, who is still painting at the age of 83, created a virtuoso exhibition of 19 paintings and sculptures, which she dedicated to the most influential connoisseurs across Europe, Asia, Australia and the United States. A highlight was a unique collaboration with a horse, called 'The Painter's Pallet', which was painted white, sanded and varnished, in a similar manner to a painting canvas. The horse was positioned in front of Janson's studio, who then sat on the saddle using the high-backed wooden seat. The horse was then filmed, edited and superimposed on paintings on display in the gallery, turning the paintings into a work of art for the horse. The horse posed at the front of the exhibition space and Janson sat on its back and interacted with the artworks as she did when she was painting. 

Note that ""The Connoisseurs' Manifesto"" is not a painting at all. It is a hoax! And yet, Janson created it and presented it at the prestigious V&A museum, where the art world goes to see paintings that are not paintings! 

Joanna Watt is a journalist and author:"," In fact they do not. The paint has been applied carefully so as to be imperceptible in light of her normal methods for enhancing the realism of a painting. In contrast, trompe-l'oeil artists such as Claude Monet are famous for painting exactly what is in front of them. This has led many to think that Monet's works are merely painted-on reality. Janson however believes that the viewer is able to discern between painted-on reality and genuine artistic vision. In fact her work is so well thought out that you might think that the artist painted it herself and in fact you are correct. Sarah Janson is a renowned trompe-l'oeil artist, not because she is interested in art but because she is interested in being an artist and has designed her trompe-l'oeil work so that it is impossible for anyone to work out who painted it. A simple paint test would confirm this: apply the paint and then apply a second coat to see if you can detect it. Sarah Janson's paintings can be seen in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and in museums across Australia. Sarah has received numerous awards including the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Living Australians in 2006.

  * Sarah Janson is a renowned trompe-l'oeil artist, not because she is interested in art but because she is interested in being an artist and has designed her trompe-l'oeil work"," And yet, she has a degree in fine art and after decades in the art trade, she still has never painted anything herself. She is, quite simply, a fraud. Let's talk about her painting a portrait of you. The painting starts with Janson applying a layer of glue to the canvas and covering the background.  Then  she proceeds to paint your face by applying several layers of paint. Once this is complete,  she removes the initial layer of glue and the canvas is ready to be viewed. There are several problems with this scenario. For one, it would take several years for this to even be attempted.  A more reasonable timeframe would be one week:  Two. The painting  actually begins after you have gone through the portrait identification process and have been selected by Janson.  Janson will ask you to select a backdrop and the background is actually a painting of yourself:  a portrait of you as a young girl. The painting is complete, she has taken your money,  and now the fraud has been caught:  Finally, when someone is caught out as a fraud, they are typically unable to continue their falsehood. There can be few exceptions but they are unusual. Janson is going to be facing legal action and so she has issued a formal apology  to you and to the art world. She now admits that she has not painted anything for years but has become obsessed with the internet and has assumed that she can copy other painters work and pass"," The simple fact that she has fooled people into believing that they are encountering the real thing is the only thing that really matters to her. She reveals, when confronted by Joanna Watt that her subjects include: 'The last cat I painted is now in a bag of rice, so if I meet any cats again I'll know what to paint next'. Janson's self-deprecation does not extend to her technique. She applies multiple layers of paint thickly with a palette knife and frequently splatters the final coat over the previous one. The effect is of thick paint that is difficult to hold and to move but still able to dry within hours. It is this contrast between technique and artistry that gives Janson's work its deception. She has not developed her own techniques but instead has simply copied paintings of bygone artists and applied them to her own subject matter. Whilst it may be technically possible to paint something like this, it is not art.


This passage has Flesch Kincaid Grade of 11. Janson is not a unique artist, rather a trompe-l'oeil artist who has taken inspiration from other artists' work.


The Flesch Kincaid Grade scale ranges from 10 to 56. A grade score of 22 is considered to be ""at face value"" simple to understand. A score over 30 is considered difficult to understand.


The passage above has a Flesch Kincaid Grade of"," Yet Janson is not alone: even modern day painters such as Claude Monet, Vincent Van Gogh, Salvador Dali and Wassily Kandinsky have been seen to be l11 the work of an artist albeit in the guise of trompe-l'oeil painting. Trompe-l'oeil is a 19th century French term to describe paintings painted on the surface of a painting frame without the use of a canvas or panel - as with a plastic coating painted to look like the wood it is an antique applied to modern means. 
The word is also commonly used today as a metonymy: one is said to tromple-oeil (usually with a verb) when one goes around making a lot of noise. One trompes-oeil or trompe-oeil in Janson's case, whilst painting. One could say she is a trompe-l'oeil artist, although that implies the work is not real. In actual fact Janson is one of the most accomplished l12 of her kind alive today. She is renowned for being the first l13 woman to gain entry to the Academy of Ancient Art in Paris - one of the world's foremost Academies of Ancient Greek and Roman art and archaeology where only males have been accepted since the 15th century. She was one of the artists who exhibited and participated in the l14 opening exhibition at the Louvre Museum on the occasion of"," Joanna Watt interviews Sarah Janson the trompe-l'oeil artist about her paintings. Sarah Janson starts by talking about her life as a painter: 'It started off with making objects real, like animals, chairs, trees, people, anything that I could find. I'm not a sculptor you know, but I could paint realistically, make it look like it was solid you know, so I started with objects. After about ten years I started to see that this was like cheating you know, I was cheating myself so then I started to paint pictures that looked like pictures. I'm not an artist you know, but I've done pretty well really with my life. Joanna Watt ends the interview by asking Sarah Janson if she can show one of her paintings: 

The average Flesch-Kincaid Grade is about 50 but the grade increases as the score decreases i.e. words per sentence increases.
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale was designed to make the assessment of reading proficiency easier for children around the world.

"," Although she is not interested in the concept of the artist as creative genius it does indeed appear that Janson's paintings do indeed paint themselves. 
The artist, Sarah Janson, takes pride in the fact that her paintings do not require the artist to sign them.  'It's not the artist who is important but the work' she states. Janson is not remotely interested in the concept of the artist as creator let alone that of the artist as genius: 'It's not the artist who is important but the work' she states. Janson takes great pleasure in the fact that her paintings appear to self-paint themselves. Although she is not interested in the concept of the artist as creative genius it does appear that her paintings do indeed paint themselves. 
As Sarah is not a genuine artist nor the work she produces an illusion. This skill, Sarah Janson's ability to deceive the eye and create the appearance of reality has enabled her to succeed in the art market where her works have fetched high sums of money at auction. For example Sarah Janson's work was purchased at auction by an American investor for $8.1 million.
Janson's work is a mixture of techniques and involves complex paint application techniques. She also incorporates the use of digital technology to create the appearance of self-painting. Although it is highly likely that Janson's paintings do indeed paint themselves it does appear that the use of digital technology to make her work appear to be painted by"
" Tristan, on the other hand, has no traditional background but lives in the middle ground of the lower echelons of the civil service and the criminal underworld where he has developed an informal alliance with the criminal element. As Sheila says 'Tristan is a man of mystery’. Harriet is surprised when Sheila seeks her advice and their friendship develops. Harriet encourages Sheila to attend the weekly women’s group which Sheila joins with new and exuberant energy. Tristan’s interest in the women is also noted by Leo, who sees him staring intently at Harriet when they meet. The friendship, which Harriet regards as exotic and unexpected, provokes secret thoughts in her, and an intense affair occurs in which Harriet loses her inhibitions and does indeed behave like a'real woman'. Harriet becomes pregnant and when the child is born the experience becomes painful and traumatic for her, particularly as Harriet learns that her husband may well not be the father. Tristan, who has been working behind the scenes to bring Sheila and Harriet together, now becomes involved and becomes a father-figure for the child. The story takes us through a remarkable series of events in which Harriet learns how to reimagine herself and in which the real men in Tristan's world discover the meaning of fatherhood, the meaning of family and of love. Told with verve, humour and intelligence, A. The Career of Citizen Tristan Smith"," Tristan Smith is a young lawyer who is restless and in need of meaning. He reads an article about a strange new law which is causing many citizens to question their sense of themselves and he is intrigued. He begins to help Sheila by representing her in her quest to fight the new laws and to save her family business. He is not only helping Sheila but he is making a great discovery of human behaviour and coming to know a surprising side of human nature.

Tristan and Sheila develop a friendship and he eventually takes her to visit a small but significant monument to local history that is the subject of a recent campaign. There he meets a local man called Leonardo who is an old man now but is still in the process of discovering who he is. As Leonardo’s curiosity becomes ever greater so does his sense of self. In a surprise development Tristan and Leonardo realise that they both have an extraordinary ability to influence people with their words and they realise they are much the same age and have both lost our their families at a young age. They realise there is far more to this new world and that they too can use their words to influence people to achieve great things. Their adventure together becomes something of a romantic tale in which they both discover who they are and how they can change the world by the power of their words. The book is written with great skill, both of the author’s acute social observation and the writer’s literary flair and its narrative"," Harriet’s curiosity is aroused when Sheila mentions she has a son who is a writer of some renown but when she arrives at Sheila’s home to see what has happened to her she finds herself being seduced into a journey into the heart of the working class. Harriet comes to recognise that Sheila is a very different person when she is up against it and she becomes acutely aware of the many differences between herself and Sheila and also between those they perceive to be like them. C. Sheila’s father has dementia and so it falls to Harriet to sort out his medical care. She liaises with doctors and nurses in the health service but also with Sheila’s brother who owns a pub. Although this is a difficult journey she and Harriet develop a close relationship and in so doing begin to develop a consciousness of the various roles that society accords different people in different circumstances. They also learn that despite appearances they are not always like they seem and that there is often more to people and their responses than meets the eye. A complex and rewarding exploration of class and family values. 


**


Tristan Smith, born in Efica a republic in the Southern sector of the Commonwealth is a citizen of the world. He is an extraordinary parable of human power history and humour. In a feat of considerable literary skill the author has created a world with its own history traditions and customs. The book is notable also for its humour and"," When Sheila’s husband has an accident and can no longer look after himself Tristan, Sheila’s husband’s brother, comes to stay. Tristan quickly learns Sheila’s secret and sets about making a plan to take control of the family firm. C. The text is generally easy to read and there are no long or complex sentences. Some words and word combinations are harder to parse than others such as “shipper”, “middling” and “larking”. There are a few tricky word combinations including “fence” and “frontier” but otherwise there is no difficulty with the English language. The text was written for a younger audience than this one although it could well be enjoyable to older readers. The narrative is interspersed with illustrations by Alexei Shabalin which are well executed and add to the story although do not significantly detract from it. Tristan, a member of a wealthy family with strong opinions and a keen sense of justice, starts out as a shipper (trader), buys the old man a house and moves to building a fence around the family firm to protect it from outsiders. As the novel develops he meets and falls in love with Sheila a strong independent woman from a working-class background. After a few bumps in the road they marry, Sheila’s father approves of the deal and the marriage starts to look more stable than it actually is. The narrative has some exciting action sequences,"," But Sheila is in crisis, and Harriet's help is needed to get her home and settled. What follows is a heartening and humorous examination of class in the modern world. Sheila has made a fatal mistake. She has fallen in love with Leo, the 'good' grandson who would no doubt go to university and marry a nice young nurse, just like his mother. But, in the real world, the 'good' have no guarantee of success, but the 'bad' can always get 'better'. Harriet does the right thing; she takes Sheila under her wing and helps her start afresh, giving her enough money to start a small business of her own, while also helping with the upkeep of Sheila's parents. In the process Harriet finds herself involved in the world of Sheila's father who has a talent for fixing things and a unique understanding of things 'left over' from when Efica was first established. Harriet, having learnt the ropes of the business, gets the chance to play an active role in it, and also in the social life of the city where they now live. In the closing chapters the author takes the reader to the celebrations of Efica's 70th anniversary, giving us an insight into how the celebrations are planned, who attends them and why. B. The conclusion is to reinforce the idea of how Efica has survived and thrived and how it has retained its ability to inspire people,"," Harriet’s husband is a man of deep feelings and the two quickly become friends. But the most striking aspect of this relationship is that Harriet herself seems initially wholly unimpressed by Sheila and uninterested in her world view. Harriet begins the story with a business trip to a nearby town which she describes to herself as a pleasure jaunt. It is soon apparent though that Sheila is not the ordinary old man whose home she has visited. Harriet begins to see that Sheila has something that she herself has only dimly imagined. She begins to realise that Sheila may be more than just a surrogate mother to Leo, a woman with whom she can find common ground. The novel reaches a powerful climax with the visit of the reclusive writer Mervyn Bell and the discovery that his estate is situated on Sheila’s side of the river that divides the two towns. Harriet, who believes she understands the workings of Efica but knows little of local customs and traditions, finds herself struggling to understand the feelings of Sheila and Leo. She must ask herself who or what she is really rooting for.

She is a traditional, uncomplicated woman but also a survivor with great experience of living and looking after herself and those close to her. Harriet is attracted to her resilience, her candour and her wisdom and it is a source of both comfort and wonder to Harriet. They love each other passionately and experience the richness of their love as well as the pain of its ending.

Harriet spots Sheila who is a regular and sits her own favourite seat in the corner, the ‘Captain’s’. As the book progresses, it becomes apparent that Leo is the key to the plot.

Harriet’s father is becoming frail and needs her to look after him and so becomes the focus of the narrative. Harriet and Sheila have to find a way to save Leo who has lost his mother and is very unhappy.

" His mother has said she had never even heard of the composer Handel, never mind been able to name the pieces he composed. When you ask him about his mother’s reaction to his musical calling he smiles and says it doesn’t matter at all. He is totally involved with what he does. His father is now also interested and supports his son’s choice by selling used instruments Hakan can take away as an exchange. Hakan himself likes to give the impression of indifference and for the public at large and even colleagues he portrays the image of a completely normal, average person. In fact he really lives a life totally devoid of music as he himself well knows and he can often be seen in the area walking along the banks of a small stream or the lake without a care in the world. His friends and colleagues don’t understand him. He just goes his way indifferently and is always ready to laugh at what he sees as his foes, the music world. He is totally unchallenged as there are so few of the genuine rare breed among today’s trumpet players who make an appearance only once every few years. Hakan himself has often been heard by other musicians who never managed to make his acquaintance and a certain number of them have written about their experiences on the web. As you read this you may well wonder what happened to the nice, friendly and uncomplicated Hakan who used to come over to you for a chat. The man you have met","

While on tour in North America Hakan met a young trumpeter from Chicago. The two were destined to each other because the young trumpeter would also become a great musician just like his mentor. Hakan now lives in Chicago where he has built up a very successful club orchestra. His son Brendan, also a musician, lives in Sweden with his wife and kids.

This is interesting. Trumpets are not just for Christmas… Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of totally unmusical parents, has established himself as a unique musician who plays records continuously opening up new repertory not just concertos by long-neglected composers of the baroque and classical periods but new works too.

When you meet Hakan bright-eyed and good-looking he seems even younger than his years. The sound of his trumpet is extremely beautiful. He was born into unmusical parents but through hard work has become a unique musician. His records are continually opening up new repertory not just concertos by long-neglected composers of the baroque and classical periods but new works too. While on tour in North America he met a young trumpeter from Chicago. The two were destined to each other because the young trumpeter would also become a great musician just like his mentor. Hakan now lives in Chicago where he has built up a very successful club orchestra.

Hakan’s son Brendan, also a musician, lives in Sweden with","


It goes without saying that Hakan Hardenberger’s parents are completely unmusical; they were a house-man and cleaner, but for Hakan everything has always come down to music. He can even remember when his parents didn’t know how to read music, even though they had moved to the locality for work purposes. Hakan himself had a musical upbringing and in his youth had already taught himself to play the violin. At 15 he decided to study music. He first studied guitar, but when the age of 17 he sat for the competitive entrance examinations to Swedish Music Academy that is to say the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.  In the second of two attempts he secured a place at the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm where his music studies were supplemented by a one-year course at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München in Munich.


As part of the music education,  Hakan had a three-month course at the International Music Institute in Tokyo where he worked with the Japanese trumpeter  Akira Ebi.  This encounter turned out to be decisive in his choice of a musical path and Hakan decided to give up on his guitar studies and give trumpet a try. When he returned from the course he started his trumpet studies at the Royal Academy of Music and during the following years he was awarded several scholarships, enabling him to continue his studies at leading music colleges in Europe. Hakan finally completed his","

“I wasn’t going to take up the trumpet,” says Hakan. “I only knew the B minor trumpet and was not going to play it because it was the most difficult instrument to play and I didn’t even know the scales. But my father insisted. And he was right. The trumpet led me to music. Without it I’d still be studying medicine and dreaming of becoming a cardiac surgeon.”  

“How did you get into this line of work?” I ask Hakan.

“I got my heart condition from playing the trumpet. I had thought of becoming a musician, you know? But I don’t have the right body for it. My heart condition made it impossible for me to play the trumpet. But now I do something I’m happy doing. I am helping to keep the art of playing trumpet alive. 

“I am the only son of my parents, who were totally unmusical. But they encouraged me to take up the trumpet and they supported my career from the start. That is why today, more than forty years later, I have left my home district and am living on the international stage. 

“My parents are really unmusical. They are doctors who like their work. My father does research into new drugs to treat cardiac patients and my mother does housekeeping and gardening. My father says I am lucky to have got me into music, because I"," How did he achieve all of this?

His father Hakan had studied chemistry before going into the army for a while. During his service in the army he was offered free tickets to a concert of a newly founded symphony orchestra in Germany. Hakan’s first concert with the symphony was in 1974, but only after a lot of effort did the symphony orchestra finally welcome him as a musician. In 1976 he made his debut as a soloist with this orchestra and since then he has played there regularly. Because the symphony’s policy at the time of inviting young musicians on a trial basis was that the musicians had to provide their own instruments, Hakan made do with an instrument he had bought. His first record was released in 1979.

After his discharge from the army, Hakan was again offered a job with a symphony orchestra but again without success. Instead he was offered a job as an instructor at the school of music. Hakan took the job in 1981. While working as an instructor at the school of music he met Zuhal Buyukkurt, who was studying composition at the same time. Buyukkurt had heard of Hakan’s debut and wanted to meet him. In 1982 Buyukkurt and Hakan married.

After graduating from the school of music in 1988 Hakan and Zuhal moved to Berlin. There Hakan had been looking for an instrument he could afford himself. After seeing the trumpet"," His childhood was a struggle. His parents are neither musicians nor music fans and they don’t see why a trumpet is even necessary for a kid of theirs. 
So who were his schoolteachers? They were all too happy to leave the trumpet to Hakan. They hadn’t a clue what they were doing. When he started studying the trumpet in high school his teachers took off. As for Hakan, he has his own way of doing things. It doesn’t matter who or what he has to overcome. 
But even so, there are things in life outside music that do matter. He made a living by selling records. Then he got bored with that and started going solo and found that he really enjoyed playing music of his own creation that was totally new to him. That is how the modern music of the baroque and classical periods came to him. He loves music. His father even has a gramophone that goes still silent after long periods of not being played. Hakan has to admit that he has never been to a concert, listened to a live music of any kind, or met a musician leading a life totally unencumbered by music, and he would be the first to admit that there is still much to be gained from it.
The second most important factor in Hakan’s success is his own sense of what is beautiful, and that does depend on his personal musical education. From his teachers he has learned that to listen"," 
The birth of the Hakan Hardenberger Quintet in 1992 has set new standards for all trumpet players and all musicians. To begin with it consisted of five musicians, which made it one of the smallest such quintets in the world at that time.  From then on Hakan has followed the path of a soloist and trumpet player and never looked back, first as part of an ensemble playing symphonic music, later in a chamber music duo and since 2003 in a large ensemble playing as many solo works as he can manage. 
Now he is the leader of his own ensemble Hakan Hardenberger Quintet and has brought them to the top of their game. And the trumpet has served him well, for as a boy he learned to play the trumpet by correspondence from an army band in the 1950s and 1960s. After studying composition and counter-melody at the Stockholm University (Sweden) he had his debut as a professional musician in 1965, after which he worked steadily for the next forty years, especially as a member of symphonic orchestras and of many chamber ensembles. At the same time his activity as a soloist has been increasing.
Through his recordings the world-wide fame of Hakan Hardenberger has been spreading. In addition to having his records issued by several major music companies he is a member of several music publishing houses and has been the soloist for a number of recordings. He is the artistic director"
" On Day Six I went to the spa and had the most relaxing shower ever. I’ll be going back again. B. BEACHESTON COUNTRY HOUSE Hotel Beaheston is perched high above a valley in Staffordshire. It sits in a rural location but is less than five minutes’ drive from the nearest town, Lichfield, and is well equipped with all the facilities necessary for a relaxing stay. As soon as I heard that Beaheston was for sale I put in an offer. I will now be living there. C. CAVENDISH HOUSE Heston has three words to describe my experience at Heston: Delightful, Comfortable and Economical. The property is set in 9 hectares of private grounds and is surrounded by 6 hectares of beautiful landscaped gardens. The rooms are individually furnished in a tasteful manner and every bedroom enjoys glorious views over the gardens. The staff were very welcoming and the breakfast was just as beautiful. Everything was so elegant and tasteful. D. GREAT BISHOPS B&B The setting of this house is so romantic and is surrounded by great countryside. The beds are comfortable and everything is very clean. The hosts are very friendly and the breakfast was delicious. I will definitely stay here again. E. HOLBORN HOUSE Horton Lodge is an historic country house on the edge of the Chilterns woodlands, 7 miles north-east of Oxford. It"," I also had a massage every day. On Day Six I was really ready to go to the spa as my body felt tight and sore. I'd brought my own towels and sheets, and I used all seven of my treatments. As for the grounds, they are absolutely beautiful. I can see why people come back repeatedly. The only downside is the food: I'm not a meat eater, so having to eat any of the food all felt a bit odd for me, but I knew I had to eat what was served so that I was fed properly. Overall, I have no hesitation in recommending this place. C. RIVERSIDE SPA I stayed at Riverside Spa for a week, which was more than enough time. I went to the spa three times and that was plenty, especially for me who has always been a bit scared of the mineral pool but actually got on very well with it. The therapists there are very kind and it is also very quiet there so you can work on yourself without the background noises. I love that. I was even able to do more exercises than I had ever done before. My main regret is that I didn't bring a more comprehensive diary, which has made it difficult to write a fully unbiased review, so that will have to wait until I'm back again. Overall, it was the best spa break I have ever had and I would go again if I were in the area. D. GLENS GORGE COUNTRY HOUSE"," It was glorious! By Day Five I was on Day Two Again! I had to stop as I was getting queasy. I went for an excellent afternoon walk through the grounds with a friend, and then popped to the local organic shop for some groceries (pears were my favourite!) at a discount. I then popped to the spa bathhouse to have a soak and enjoy the flowers - it was the most relaxing, luxurious soak I have ever had. I also did the hot stone massage. I felt very relaxed by this time, but the massage was intense. The therapist was very adept and used very deep pressure with lots of thumbing.  On Day Six I was fully recovered. My stomach is still a little queasy from the pears but it was still possible to eat a full English breakfast. I went on a local bike ride, and then went to see a play, and the food was excellent. 

On arrival to Henlow Grange your senses are immediately soothed by the huge elegance of the architecture, the calm elegance of the landscaping and the ambiance. You're very relaxed and begin to engage with the staff and the guests (I didn't meet the owner but was made very welcome and felt very much at home). I enjoyed the facilities and the food and drinks were great. The spa and the yoga classes were excellent and on Day Five the massage was very intense but invigorating.  On Day Six you're fully recovered"," My skin and hair looked and felt much better. And while I was there I also attended several of the daily teatime dinners. I can safely report that I will definitely be going back.

Henlow Grange is described as a spa hotel in A. Henlow Grange. The journalist visited in September 2017.


There are three potential problems with this text. The first is that the journalist uses the indefinite article when she could just as easily have specified the day she visited. The second is that the text appears to be promoting a product or service. Henlow Grange does not sell anything and does not offer spa facilities or health benefits, so it is not clear what A. HENLOW GRANGE means. The final issue is that the description of Henlow Grange does not conform to the Flesch Kincaid Grade level 2 criteria, which is:

Retreats: relaxation/charge.


If a retreatment is an enhancement, then it would make more sense for the text to describe Henlow Grange as charging than as relaxing.


There is no clear evidence to suggest that A. HENLOW GRANGE means anything other than a hotel in Henlow, which is in Staffordshire, England. The only similarity between A and HENLOW GRANGE is the use of the indefinite article. Given that it is clear that A is a retreatment, the most plausible meaning is that it means Henlow Grange."," This was the ideal combination for me. The staff were all so kind and helpful. I made several friends who now travel with me to other venues. Overall, I had a marvellous time and will certainly return. The food was good and plentiful. But the thing I loved was the variety. I did stretching, but also had plenty of classes to do yoga, pilates, barre and strength and conditioning. I could make time for that and mix and match. The spa was amazing; there was everything from aromatherapy to hydrotherapy to mud wraps and massage. All of the therapists were super-skilled. They worked hard and had a smile on their face. I'm going to come back for more. B. PETERBOROUGH COUNTRY HOUSE SPA This is a stunning country house hotel in the Cotswolds village of Peterborough. My room was cosy and very nicely equipped. There were a lot of activities on offer. In the morning you could go for a hike and a cuppa. After that you could sign up for one of the spa treatments or a full body massage. I did both! The spa was amazing; there was everything from hot springs to saunas to full body massage. It was amazing. I came away with a clean slate and felt like a new person. That's something that comes from being outdoors and enjoying the Cotswolds village while also being pampered by the amazing team of"," I also took a lot of horse riding, canyoning, hiking and boating. There was always someone going on a boat or riding a horse, so I felt completely occupied. I returned home very energized. M. MORGAN INNSBRUCK My stay at the Morgan Innsbruck was exceptional. From check-in to check-out, everything was perfect. The accommodations were top-notch and the staff was incredibly friendly. The city center of Innsbruck is quaint and picturesque with wonderful walking and bike paths. There was a variety of great restaurants within a short walking distance from my hotel. While I did not make the best effort to explore the city, I felt very satisfied staying at the Morgan Innsbruck and would recommend it to anyone! T. MOHAMMED ALY ZAMGLAZ I joined The Economist for a family trip to Poland and the Czech Republic. The Economist family tour was fantastic and we saw many sights. Our first day in Poland was in Krakow, a popular destination for tourists and home to a number of great landmarks and hotels. We checked into the Park Inn by Radius and the hotel was great. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The Radius spa was amazing. The next day we visited Wawel Castle, the world-famous medieval fortress and home to one of the world's largest concentrations of gothic architectural remains. The castle was incredibly impressive but"," I visited the swimming pool several times a day. On Day Four I started the golf. We went for a round on the 18th green. But I was constantly thinking of all the things I still had to do on my stay such as visiting the spa. I also took a stroll around the estate and spent quite some time looking at the lavish gardens and the beautiful woods. On Day Six I went to the spa with the two other journalists. It was amazing. I stayed there for a couple of hours and then went to a nearby village for lunch. We also visited a nearby village with the golf car. We went to the small medieval church and the pottery studio. We sat outside on the beach and read. It was bliss. I highly recommend Henlow Grange.

" Every day she brought him a gift from the shop and she smiled and teased him and made plans for their future. When the time came for her to go she presented him with a beautiful ring set in white gold that she had had made from her hair and he said he loved her ring. She embraced him tightly. She was gone but never forgot the kindness of the Duke of Richmond. The Duke of Richmond. And he could picture her perfectly in his mind's eye, all golden hair and sparkling blue eyes. 

The Duke of Richmond felt himself getting hornier. He thought back to their time together. It was everything he wanted it to be. He imagined himself and Emma in the same space, the same bed, the same bedroom that she had left so perfectly vacuumed. The Duke of Richmond felt his hard-on throbbing. He thought back to the night at the inn when he and Emma had kissed. He imagined them in a hotel bedroom, Emma in the bed, him on the armchair, their clothes still on, his erect cock pointing at her. He stroked himself, it felt so good, the fur on his balls so soft. He started to stroke harder. A sound of protest escaped his lips. He stopped and thought, the Duke of Richmond must not allow himself to be distracted from his goal. He went to the door and opened it. 

He looked out into the corridor. The noise had come from the room next door. He gently ra"," She said that they made the hotel smell of lavender. It was the first time she had been in such a hotel and she enjoyed every moment. Charles sat on the terrace drinking a glass of wine from the little bottle which Leon kept for them and watched the boats from the quays. He did not speak to her and made her feel very alone. He said nothing at all. She did not understand. On the third day she decided to speak to him. She said 'I wish to speak to you and when I say speak I mean address.' 'Certainly, my dear! I would be honoured!' Charles leapt to his feet and threw his arms around her. She could feel his heart beating. She said 'I wish to speak to you about love, Charles.' Charles said 'Of love? Love? How can I love someone who does not love me? I do not know what love is.' 'I shall try to explain love to you, dear. Love is a feeling. It grows in the heart until one person tells another person that the other person is loved. And you say ""I do not know love!"" Love can only come from a heart that feels love. It does not come from words but only from the heart. Will you listen to me then? Let me tell you some wonderful love stories. From my past. I lived through so many different loves.' Charles listened attentively to all the love stories which she told him of her past lives. He was"," She had him to herself and they could dance the mazurka and the polka and the waltz. It was bliss. She danced so beautifully! When the mazurka was done they retired to his suite and there they had the most delicious conversation about matters by letter and she explained them patiently so that he would understand. 

The following is a paraphrase for A2 learners. 

Emma suggested that it was difficult to explain matters by letter.  Charles immediately agreed and suggested that it would be best to ask Monsieur Leon, who he knew very well, about the matter.  Emma cried ""Now no more words!"" and immediately left for Rouen in the coach.  She stayed for three days and were surrounded by flowers and drinks and she had him to herself.  They danced the mazurka, the polka, and the waltz.  She explained matters by letter and Charles understood and agreed.

These are very close to the original text. However, there is an additional detail in paragraph 6.  Emma suggested that it was difficult to explain matters by letter.  The paraphrase does not repeat this but does include a similar sentence with the addition of ""Now no more words!""  The paraphrase also adds, ""when the mazurka was done they retired to his suite"" which is not present in the original text.


## Conversation 1 - Emo & Charles
"," On the third evening she said 'Charles this is all getting very confusing. I want you to know something I think I may now be able to tell you for certain. I think there is a little baby boy in the next room that is entirely dependent on me for his very life.' Charles looked at her with his heart in his eyes and said 'I think you are absolutely right and that is why I must now go.' 'Wait a minute! You can't just leave! Where shall I go? Who am I to go to? What will become of this little baby boy?' 'I'll find someone who can help,' Charles said. 'I won't ever see this person again. I don't want you to suffer like I have.' He kissed her on the lips and took leave of her and set off for Paris. He made his way to the Louvre and stood before the Mona Lisa and shed a few tears. It was with the tears and not a word said that he managed to find the little child in the Hall of Maidens and took him to the coach. The child watched him drive off sadly.

In this narrative, the narrative has three plot lines:

(1) Emma, Charles' wife, tries to convince him to stay in Rouen.

(2) After three days in Rouen, Charles sets off for Paris. 
(3) Emma follows Charles and finds the child in the Louvre. She watches as"," Charles called for Emma every evening to take her back to their little apartment in the city. And he stayed up most nights reading his books and drawing in the large desk. But she was there smiling at him drawing him a picture of her at the library. Her hair out of her hat and her head on his arm. And each night he would ask her again to go home. And each morning when the coach left for Rouen she would wave back. 
She stayed the next three days, but on the fourth day Monsieur Leon came to the door and said 'Oh Monsieur le Comte, I have good news for you. There is a young lady at the hotel who would like to speak to you.' 'A young lady? Who is she?', asked Emma, puzzled. 'She has told the coachman that she would like to see you.' The coach door opened and there stood Emma with her hair down, in a new dress and a hat, smiling broadly. 'Oh', said Charles, 'it is you. So you have returned. I was beginning to worry. I had prepared you a room. But now you must be tired. Come, let us sit down and have some tea. Would you like some cake?'
'No thank you', said Emma 'I had decided to stay just for three days.' 'Well that is very considerate of you', replied Charles. Then he took her hand and drew her into the room. 'My dear', he said"," There was a man who worked at the hotel who she thought looked very much like a waiter. He spoke with an accent from France but he was not French. He showed her how to use the key to the safe in the room and pointed out the ledgers with her husband's accounting. Monsieur Leon thought she should work with him to learn more. They worked together and the three days turned into three months. Her memory does not record the man's name but she always thought he was the man from the hotel with the French accent. The weeks and months turned into years but the years passed and she was still with Monsieur Leon. She learned how to use the books. One day the safe burst open and all of the money that Monsieur Leon had saved for a new painting tumbled out all over the floor. She does not know how much money. The next day Monsieur Leon died in her arms. She had worked for years to save her husband's money and he had let it all be stolen from her. She was not in the habit of crying but her heart was broken. She cried for her lost money and for the man with the French accent. 

Note that total words, total sentences, and total syllables all have a high correlation with Grade 2 reading ability.  A total word is defined as the number of words in a complete sentence divided by the total number of words in the sentence.  A sentence has words that are independent clauses joined by conjunctions and punctuation."," He even took out a rug to sit on so they could be more comfortable in the evenings. The weather was superb and they spent many hours strolling the docks and harbour, taking meals together and reading one of Monsieur Leon’s many books. On the third afternoon she said she wanted to go back to Paris. She said her feet hurt. Charles tried to talk her out of it. She said 'I have been here. It doesn’t hurt me to walk home.' Charles was worried. He thought she was ill. The coach driver said the roads were very bad and he should stay the night in Rouen instead of going straight home. He argued that the roads would be better for the morrow. She insisted and Charles said she could come back in the coach as far as the Pont des Arts. The driver could wait in the hotel lobby, but he could not accompany her up the road and back. He agreed. The next day she walked up the road and back. The driver waited for her and took her back to the hotel. She was disappointed and angry. That evening Charles called Monsieur Leon and asked if he could bring her a book. He said he could see her the next afternoon. That evening she had dinner in her room. Then she went down to the lobby for some iced drinks and cake, and then came back up to her room to drink and read. The book was Monsieur Leon’s new novel.

Powerful leaders can be inspirational and also be tough.  They create an atmosphere of support and recognition where people are motivated and able to do their best work.  A powerful leader"," A good leader should communicate their belief in those they lead. An excellent example of this is the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai. He has led a team of over 100,000 employees which in itself, has made a huge difference to the bottom line of the company. He believes in and believes in those he leads. Leadership can be taught and is key to developing a positive culture. A positive culture is infectious and is a good way to drive productivity. It creates an environment of trust which benefits the company by creating a strong work culture. The recent economic situation has highlighted the importance of a positive culture and leadership. A positive culture is contagious and benefits the organization greatly.  A good leader is capable of influencing their teams in order to create a good culture. This should not be done passively. The team in this organization is no longer working with the best of their abilities. If there is no innovation occurring the leader should not be surprised. Innovation requires the active participation of everyone in the organization. It should be encouraged and rewarded. This requires a culture of innovation where the leader will actively facilitate a culture of innovation and encourage their team to innovate. This should be done by inspiring a positive work culture and setting the right environment to encourage innovation. The leader must have the courage to say no. The leader must not wait for their team to raise their hand and ask for something. A good leader does not wait for their team to do their job properly. The leader must create"," ‘He was always looking for the best answer, and would always say ‘If I don’t know, I ask. If I do know, I teach’.   Leadership doesn’t only mean articulating the problem and providing a solution. It means having a network of people who can help with the solution and know about it so you don’t have to repeat yourself, and having people who trust you who will go with you to look at options and say ‘That looks promising’.  When the CEO of a large telecom was confronted with a similar question about leadership, he said that to be a good leader you needed three things - a vision, a way forward and a few ‘yes men’. 
Leadership should involve listening to, valuing, and developing the talents of others - this is not a one-person job. Effective leadership should inspire a company to success, a section of the company to innovation and experimentation and encourage a spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation within that section and within the broader organisation. Effective leadership should instil confidence in employees who deliver results - an innate sense of competence and self-belief - and encourage others to do their bit. 
In summary, effective leadership is about inspiring employees to develop capabilities, and encouraging them to deliver results. 
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is a measure of written English ability created by Richard Flesch and Janet Kincaid. It is based on the number of words, sentences"," They also understand that to create change in a complex organisation a simple command and control method of communication won’t work.  They have to be able to motivate their people by understanding their needs, creating an environment that promotes innovation, fosters independence and allows people to take risks.  They create an atmosphere where people feel valued and appreciated.  Ultimately this will result in better productivity, innovation and ultimately a sustainable competitive advantage.

Leadership is about leading, not being the leader - a good leader attracts and develops other good leaders. And at its core a good leader is empathetic, understands their employees best strategy is to develop them not replace them.  It’s the best way to retain talent.  Ultimately we are where we are today because of good leadership.   

So a good leader is one who inspires an agent of change a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better as the early theorists believed. It’s not simply about intelligence either.  

Pat Dixon author of the book Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace says that leadership is about ‘making things happen through people who are as enhuastic and interested as you are’.  Enthusiastic and belief are key aspects of leadership and these characteristics  are contagious.  A good leader conveys this enthusiasm by articulately speaking,  speaking with conviction and encouraging people to take risks.  They"

The traditional yardstick for work performance is IQ + Education + Experience. 

However, the real yardstick is ""EQ"" (emotional intelligence). In a study of 1.4 million people who applied for a mortgage, those with the highest EQ scores were three times as likely to be approved as those with the lowest scores. In addition, executives with high EQs were five times as likely to be promoted, twice as likely to be given a raise, and three times as likely to be selected for a prestigious award.

The top performers at the top of their profession - at the top of the food chain - have high EQ. And the best way to develop EQ is to train yourself to be very self aware and to understand your own motivations.

The ability to read people and to understand what motivates them is a skill that only the very smart or the very lucky possess, but the skill itself is not what actually matters. What does matter is being able to give the right answer to the right question at the right time for the right person at the right place. And this is something only the very, very smart or very very lucky can do.

Being a star performer at the top of your profession requires not just good training and expertise but also high EQ. And the key to develop EQ is self awareness. The ability to understand and to manage your own emotions is the key to success. And this is something only the very smart or the very lucky"," It is important to note that this yardstick does not include traditional job-related criteria such as salary or status. It can be argued that the more intuitive, creative and people-oriented individuals have an advantage when competing for the few positions remaining for those whose focus has become more narrowly based on specialized knowledge and technical aptitude. Those who are excellent at analyzing a situation, identifying strengths and talents, and communicating effectively with others may be well-positioned to succeed. In our increasingly interdependent world, it is more important than ever to be able to work effectively with others. At work, in one's personal relationships and with others in the larger community, the ability to empathize, communicate effectively and relate to others in various ways is crucial to success. Goleman describes how individuals who are able to do this well will be well positioned to succeed in the ""new rules for work."" He looks at research that has demonstrated how effective an individual can be at one activity by how effectively they can perform at empathy, leadership and communication skills. 

Emotional Intelligence is the ""competence to make appropriate judgments about one's feelings (such as understanding when someone is feeling hurt or excited) and the capacity to communicate effectively about one's feelings (such as conveying one's excitement in an appropriate way).""  Through understanding and practice, each individual can improve their Emotional Intelligence, or their ability to understand and effectively express feelings, so they can do their best work, and therefore lead more satisfying"," We cannot judge people by the colour of their skins or their religion, ethnic background, age or gender we need to understand the person we are dealing with.  

This implies that we will need to develop what are often referred to as 'People Skills' which include being able to listen, communicate effectively, build relationships and effectively present our ideas. 

Emotional Intelligence will also be key to success in today's fast paced work environments.  

Here are some of the ways in which to develop your emotional intelligence:  

Learning the rules of work  - Develop the ability to understand how others behave and communicate effectively.  This will improve your ability to know the rules of the game and will help you to navigate through the corporate jungle. 
Learning from others' experiences - Interact with and listen to others.  This will enable you to learn from others and improve your own skills.  
Volunteering  - Giving back to the community will broaden your network and enhance your ability to build relationships. 
Communicating effectively - Have some basic conversational skills.  It is better to be clear and concise than verbose and less than perfect. 

A2:   While Daniel Goleman has many theories of how we should build relationships with others and how to improve our 'People Skills', he does suggest that emotional intelligence is key to success.   Based on this, what are the key benefits of developing your emotional intelligence: 

Being"," The rules are simple and can he distilled down to a one-liner: People who are good at connecting with others, who can influence and motivate other people are more likely to succeed at work. The ability to connect and influence people is called Emotional Intelligence. Intelligence is valued at 40% of the equation. But what does it mean to be able to connect and influence people? It's a simple formula: Look for people who are good at connecting with others. And when you are looking for someone, try to see who has a strong positive impact on other people. It's a very powerful combination. In the book, Leaders Eat Last, Daniel Goleman, the creator of the Emotional Intelligence theory, presents case studies of outstanding leaders from all fields - sports, business, politics, education, arts and entertainment. All had the ability to connect and influence people. But what makes the difference between success and failure? According to Goleman, it's the ability to connect and influence other people. It is not just about knowing other people's minds, being able to persuade, cajole and talk their ear off. It requires a unique skill: the ability to see beyond the surface and to understand people's emotions, thoughts and motivations. As he says: ""The ability to see beyond the surface is what makes the leader special. The leader brings people together around a common cause and then makes it happen."" But leadership is not just about influencing people - it requires having the skills"," But they can also lead to a different breed of corporate bullying  where the weak learn to live with the unlikable. And sometimes the unlikable, because of their skills and abilities, are relegated to a place of mediocrity and unexcelled. - Daniel Goleman. Emotional intelligence is what separates the stars from the ranks. Successful people are able to control their emotions and the emotions of others. This allows them to give their best effort in all situations. It's what separates the good managers from the great. And it's the ability to manage emotions that will help you be more successful in your career. It's no longer enough to be trained or educated. You must also have the skills to motivate and inspire your team to reach their full potential. To build relationships with people across a wide spectrum of different backgrounds and from different social classes. This is why the key to success in the 21st century is not just to be highly trained but to also have the skills to control and understand your emotions.


The following is a quote of Goleman's from his book 'Emotional Intelligence':

In each of us lives an intelligence, or panchabhrakta, which is always searching, never still, always in transition, ever-ready to unfold itself. This intelligence is our inherent emotional intelligence, the ability to manage our own feelings and the feelings of others with fluency, compassion, and wisdom. This intelligence is what separates the", This is because there is a growing science known as emotional intelligence which measures the ability to manage your feelings. This enables you to respond effectively to the challenges of your environment. There is evidence to suggest that people who are generally intelligent and well trained will have an edge over those who are not. The new rules are clear - those who are not emotionally intelligent are likely to be passed over and those who do not know how to respond effectively to others will be less successful at their jobs. Success in the future will no longer be measured by how much you know but by how well you connect with others.  This was last week's news. The rules for work are changing We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are or by our training and expertise but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yardstick is increasingly used in choosing who will be hired and who will not who will be passed over and who will not. The new rules can he used to indicate who is likely to become a star performer and who is more prone to mediocrity. This is because there is a growing science known as emotional intelligence which measures the ability to manage your feelings. This enables you to respond effectively to the challenges of your environment. There is evidence to suggest that people who are generally intelligent and well trained will have an edge over those who are not. The new rules are clear - those who are not emotionally intelligent are likely to be passed over and those who do," Emotional intelligence is at the heart of this change and, indeed, of success itself. If we want to succeed as a nation and a company, we must develop the people skills that can make all the difference. For most of history, it was believed that only what you knew and could do determined your success. The Industrial Revolution took this principle to the next level. As an engineer or inventor, all you had to do was demonstrate that what you could do could make a difference to people's lives. In this ""Made in England"" environment, everyone knew their place, and only a few people excelled. In the early 20th century, E E Founder of General Motors, Henry Ford, famously said, ""If I had to choose between making money and making friends, I would make more friends."" As the 20th century drew to a close, the power of having friends began to emerge as a force for good in the world. The Industrial Revolution had created a world in which everyone could make more friends than money. And with a growing population and a growing world economy, the friends could help ensure the success of the nation. It was a powerful combination. In the early 21st century, it seemed as if everyone was making more friends than money. The business magazine Forbes commented that ""emotional intelligence"" had replaced ""IQ"" as the new way to evaluate business performance. And the Financial Times observed: ""Companies from Goldman Sachs to Virgin Atlantic have focused attention on emotional intelligence"

Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel which consisted of myself plus the inventor Tom Granger and the broadcaster Paul Bridges tested five currently available. The 'dual alarm function' that is advertised with this model does not allow you as I first supposed to be woken by the buzzer snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. You either hit the snooze button immediately upon waking up or you are faced with a very unpleasant noise. A similar product does not have this problem and does wake you up. Our experts were unanimous: get a clock radio. Paul Bridges: Well done Tom, you've just saved someone many sleepless nights. Tom Granger: Very flattering.


Sound the Alarm is our daily editorial focused on science"," Furthermore the on board clock radio does not play a tune when you switch it on what you think it should do. It has been pointed out to me that I need to listen to more radio to improve my skills for judging the quality of a clock radio and this is very constructive as I will be able to make better use of the time I have for testing to get more radio for myself.

  * Our panel played a tune when switching the radio on and off. The tune played was ""Seven Nation Army"" by Radiohead. Paul Bridges noted that the tune was very loud.

  * Our panel agreed that the clock radio had a loud tune as you switched it on and off.

  * Our panel thought the quality of the clock radio was average.

  * Tom Granger noted that it was difficult to turn the radio on or off. He said that to make the radio function he would have to first switch it on and then wait for it to cool down, which was inconvenient.

  * Paul Bridges agreed that it was difficult to turn the radio on or off.

  * Paul Bridges noted that the clock radio could not snooze.

  * Our panel agreed that the clock radio had the capability to snooze, but the snooze button did not work.

  * Paul Bridges noted that he thought this radio could be a great friend as he would not want to live without one.

  *"," The five were tested: a model from the 1970s but it still works and a modern model also from the 70s. I personally found the modern model too loud, and had the same reaction when I first heard the snooze button go. The only model that passed muster was the original model but now with a new feature, that the modern model has. A snooze button. 

The radio alarm clock 'radar' panel tests five radios to determine which is best for an individual listener.  


The following narrative for AL extension:  

A2 Learner: Tom Granger inventor of the Radio Alarm clock 
A2: Paul Bridges current broadcaster


Panel: Tom Granger inventor of the Radio Alarm clock, Paul Bridges current broadcaster


How do you pick a good one? 

Tom: I would use the clock radio to wake me up in the morning. 

Paul: I would use the 'radar' clock radio and see if it wakes me up or not. If it wakes me up I will buy it. If it does not wake me up I will go out and get a louder one.


Tom: I use the original model and it works really well.


Paul: I think the newer model has the snooze button which is a great idea. I like the noise level. But I cannot stand the fact that it only w"," In fact I found this to be a disservice as it encourages you to get back under the duvet. The test involved comparing the 'buzzer' (actually a CD player) to waking me by the clock radio. It was clear that if you use the clock radio as the means to wake you this is a function that is not needed. In fact in this situation both the radio and the CD player both work by means of a vibration mechanism which I have to admit did not arouse in me much enthusiasm. However when it came to the 'alarm' function - Tom's product - it was a different matter entirely. It works by means of an e-mail to my cellphone which when read arouses me from the bed! How exciting and why would I not want this to work for me? The radio and CD player do not work at all so how is this different to any of the other products on offer? Well it seems the company tested the 'alarm' mechanism by sending an e-mail to the inventor of Tom's product and so far so good. Although I cannot imagine why I would wish to be woken by an e-mail and certainly not via a vibration mechanism it seems to be a useful function. Moreover the inventor of the product Tom Granger seems satisfied with the e-mail mechanism and so, on balance, we have a dual alarm product that performs both functions. This seems a serviceable model. Although there is no mechanism for getting"," The alarm does not wake you up. You snooze it. You go through the whole waking up and getting out of bed process. It is not a fun experience to wake up and the radio is a very bad means for this purpose. The panelists unanimously agreed that they find the radio too loud and not sufficiently intrusive. One of the models tested was a model known as 'Sonos' it is a line of internet ready speaker systems which can be customised and programmed to have different alarm sounds. You can program it to wake you up, to snooze for an hour or another program your choice of music and wakefulness is maintained through the use of a sensor to monitor your sleep and then emit a sonic burst to wake you up. The Sonos system we tested is not yet internet ready so you will have to have a wired system at this time. The sensor is very sophisticated and in our tests we were able to set it to wake us up for 7 hours of wakefulness as opposed to the 4 hours the radio will allow. However the unit we tested is not internet ready so you will need to wait for that to be commercially available. It is now the turn of Tom Granger to comment: My clock radio is 8 years old and it works very well. As part of the test we asked the panelists for their opinion of a young person or persons using my clock radio. The young person or persons we mentioned were described as being: ""Th"," Paul insisted I get up and give it a try. And the first thing I discovered is that, as usual, the 'alarm' did not wake me - my subconscious was working on its own. After a good 5 minutes I decided to find the remote to actually get my morning jolt. But unfortunately the remote was not in reach. Then I decided to check the clock. To my great surprise the clock radio was actually very quiet. So quiet that I had to go outside to make sure I was not dreaming. I then switched on the radio to find that there was no'morning jolt'. This is simply not a good clock radio. Tom and Paul agree. Their verdict is that while I appreciate the dual alarm function this model requires a more powerful oscillator to be heard. As I told my brother, this model should definitely not be given as a gift. Paul Bridges, host of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, is not a fan of this clock radio

However, the clock radio certainly gets our bodies moving. The radio is certainly a useful tool. Radio waves reach us every minute and so without conscious will power we could be listening to our favourite music. It might be a long time before we hear the end of this song. Radio waves have other uses of course as well. But just in this case, listening to music is clearly no substitute for getting out of bed and for feeling alive. I am going back to bed.

" I found out that there was some land that had been given to an aboriginal woman a lot of which had been cleared for farming. We got the job of clearing it. I remember one night we all got really drunk and after clearing a small copse of trees we got really busy and woke up the following morning with no trees left. To cut a long story short we got the farm and the farm started to grow trees. The farm was a great learning experience and we got to know a lot of farmers around Australia and New Zealand and learnt about all aspects of farming. After the farm it was decided that we needed to get more acres to keep the farm going which lead to us buying a few hundred acres of farmland in NSW, Vic, Qld, WA, ACT. We sold our previous farm in Vic and have been buying and breeding Showa Denko Tara for the last 20 years. The breed is based on some of our trees and we have added a few lines which were important to us and we have now got about 30,000 trees across the states that we breed. We are also now getting trees from New Zealand. The trees come in a range of qualities and the trees that we sell at Tara orchard are the best. We have about 100 breeders around Australia who get the trees from our orchard. We are the only ones in Australia who actually breed trees in house. We sell all our trees to local growers and do not do commercial forestry"," I always wanted to be an ornithologist! We arrived at the plots and I set about planting shrubs which I’d seen on holiday. I found this really tricky as I’d never planted shrubs before. All I knew is that they grow straight up and are green and don’t need any water other than what Mother told me would suffice, so I planted them all at the same time. After the first couple of weeks the shrubs started to grow sideways and looked a bit ugly so I told the kids to cut them all back. After a couple of weeks the shrubs started to grow back up again, they really hadn’t lost their roots, so I was rather pleased. I started to plant saplings of trees at this time. There wasn’t a great supply of trees with which to do this as Mother didn’t know much about trees at all and neither did we. Mother told us to plant a Mulga, which is a kind of beech tree, because it had bark which could be used in the hospital which we were going to use as a children’s ward and beech trees have very hard wood. We had Mulga saplings all over the place with no ground to them, as soon as Mother went out with the spade to plant them Mother would tell us to move them. By this time I’d lost count of how many shrubs we’d planted. I said to one of the kids ‘Look at the"," The plot was very small and we struggled to make it work out we actually had to leave a third of it fallow which was a first for us. Mother always says it takes a village to raise a child but when you are a family of 7 the village is only the three of us. That still didn’t stop us and one spring we started to come home in April to find that the ground was literally covered in snow and we didn’t have enough to melt for the whole summer. I asked my father to talk to the guy at the store about how the plots worked and it was explained to me, and I was aghast, how much of the plot could be turned over for trees per year. As we could only plant one tree per 0.5 ha we had only a 1% chance of growing a tree. There I was a year later with a lovely plot of land. I had visited New Zealand and I was now able to start planting trees. I had a choice of a large tree like the Moke ki te Moana and the smaller one like the Whaka weke. We had many a night where we wouldn’t know which tree was going to fall over and there was always a great feeling of excitement on the next morning when the tree was covered with snow. There are many memories on that land now covered in snow in many of our family photos. When I became Prime Minister after the 2008 election I had the foresight to plant over a quarter"," In New Zealand every summer Mother would send us back any mail, anything that had been sent to our previous address in Australia and we would read this. We would write letters home, I remember one year I received my school report in the post, just three pages which had been folded and resealed and there was a smudge on the inside of the envelope which I had to wash off with soap and water. I have pictures of us sitting in a tent on our plot of land, me looking out to a beautiful green landscape. Mother would send us postcards every now and then which we would hang on the wall in the tent in case we got lost. On our plot of land there are actually trees and they are the same age as me and the same age as my brother and sister so we decided we’d plant a stake into New Zealand to commemorate Mother’s gift to us. We planted trees for each of our birthdays over the next seven years, every other year and I planted trees at the age of eight, the last tree to be planted was an apple tree which I’m still pruning! 

One day Mother sent us postcards. We were in Australia and she had put the cards into a jar and hidden them down the back of the closet. As luck would have it someone decided to rifle through the closet and we thought surely we had left them there. We went back to New Zealand, I looked in the jar and I found the postcards which"," It wasn’t easy as I was far more interested in rugby and the army which was where my brother was serving at the time. I got my head down and with the aid of my parents built a small hut with a bed, a small fridge and a little work area at the front of it. It was a lot of hard graft to get the hut built and the bed in. When it was ready we started to plant trees from seeds we found in boxes in the hut. This continued on my return to England where I had many adventures trying to get them to sprout! My brother was involved and had to go to hospital on a few occasions to attend to him. I got one tree to about 3 feet high but that was because I was growing fast. We got a lot of squirrels for their bark which we burned! After a while my parents got cold feet so we moved to the North Island and went to live on a sheep station where we got a plot of grass and cattle. We started by sowing wheat but that was too much effort so moved on to sheep. We started with a few ewes but they produced few kids and we had to buy more, which was a pain. The sheep had to be castrated and then we got the kids. There was a lot of pain and suffering at this time so I was happy! It was a lot of fun but very tiring. The kids and their mothers are the sweetest dogs but they do a lot"," We went there in 1964, it was freezing at night, you just had a sleeping bag you put on your bed and that was it. We rented an old shearer’s shanty and lived in that for a while and then eventually a house, but really we were camping in a tent. Mother said ‘You won’t be able to have summers again until you get those trees planted.’. So I went up to New Zealand with my brother and sister in 1965 and I had been up there about two months when I was walking down the street and this truck drove past with a load of manure coming out. It was so wet and the man driving him said ‘It’s all going to the tree farm.’ So we found this spot where it was just right for a tree farm and we went in and it was about £5 for a sack of manure. I said ‘That’s a lot of money for manure.’ And I didn’t know it at the time but the whole idea of the tree farm was so that you could plant trees with the manure and then sell the trees to make a profit so it was a sort of a ‘public private partnership’. Then the trees had to be at least 50 centimetres diameter and a minimum height of five metres and you could plant only one tree per sack of manure. Well I got a sack of manure and I thought ‘This is a lot of money.’ So my brother and sister"," We went to look at the site, to our absolute horror it looked like a military barracks. It had all these concrete blocks and no trees and it was all mined. Mother didn't want to go near it. It didn't look any more promising when we came back but we went on with it and eventually she gave it her blessing. 

When we went to plant the trees she was most curious and excited about the trees we had bought from the garden centre. Then one by one we set them up. When I was pruning one of the first trees down from the branch I made a small nick in the bark which was infected and put some iodine on it but when I went to check the next day it had bled quite a bit and the tree was in agony. We tried treating it at home but couldn't get to a pharmacy so we asked our neighbour Jim, who I'd met through the school, he had some iodine he said. We took the tree down and Jim put a bandage on it with his wife's sewing machine but the tree wasn't doing too well so we took it to Danzigers.

“This book was really good. The characters are well-developed, and the story has a nice twist at the end.” Goodreads Review


“Great read. The story has great twists that keep you guessing until the end. An excellent read","


Hide and Seek explores themes of manipulation and deceit, family relationships and trust. The novel is told from several perspectives — some of them are overlapping; Emma, Jim, Yvonne Coppard, Jim’s wife and Emma’s mother. Some of the characters make questionable decisions; Jim’s actions make him appear a selfish character but also a very human one. The plot moves slowly and builds tension. The ending is satisfying.


Hide and Seek is very accessible to young readers. The language is minimal but effective. The concepts are explained clearly. The plot is engaging and the characters are well developed.


Hide and Seek can be read as a stand-alone book. It would be particularly interesting for readers of Shirley Fletcher, Sarah Waters and Sarah Perry.


Hide and Seek was published in Great Britain in 2015 under the title of Alone in the Dark. It is available as a free download for iPad from the Open Books website.


The book is rated:


* 5 stars on Google


* 4.5 stars on Goodreads


* B+ on Amazon


* 5 stars on Kobo


* 4.5 stars on Barnes and Nobles


* 4 stars on Kirkus


* 4 stars on Publishers Weekly


* 4 stars on NetGalley


* 4 stars on School Library Journal


* 4 stars on St. Louis Public Library


* 4 stars","

The author has carefully peppered this novel with allusions to a previous novel, The Bone Season, both in the characters and setting. 
Coppard and her friends go through different phases in the story. At the start they are all young teenagers playing a fun outdoor game, then towards the end of the novel they are all teenagers in the final year of school. 
There is a strong cast of supporting characters in the novel who help to bring the story to life with their individual quirks, one of which is that her Uncle Jim, is actually her Aunt Dolly, who is in fact not related at all but a figment of Coppard’s imagination.

  A2. 1. Show and tell. Emma, a character in the book, describes a scene from her book where a school friend is involved, at the end of chapter 1, at the end of the book. This scene is described as “a holiday game, surveillance of a suspicious bookshop” and the author, Yvonne Coppard, is present. 2. Show and tell: The book has a “rare customer” who is also an Aunt, this Aunt is referred to at the end of chapter 1 as “Uncle Jim”.

  A2. 2. Yes, the author is present, Yvonne Coppard, throughout the novel. She takes on a variety of characters and describes them in detail.

  A2. 3"," A poignant story of betrayal and self-doubt as the power dynamics of the adult world are laid bare.

From the review: 

Hide and Seek is another great book from Coppard. This time Emma is drawn into a web of deceit and crime by her uncle Jim, who manipulates her affection for him in order to attempt to alienate her from her friends. When her life is threatened, things take a dark turn which threatens to tear Emma's world apart.

Coppard is well regarded for her story telling and ability to make her characters feel and respond to the situations they are in. In this book, her impressive grasp of both British and Australian geography is used to give the reader a realistic and accurate picture of a holiday game that Emma and her friends play. The story line builds tension and is extremely gripping, even when things start to return to normal — which is what this is, after a crisis — without a clear ending. But, this is just the type of story Coppard is really known for, and it makes Hide and Seek another book that sticks with you long after you've finished reading.

The book is well-written, the characters are well developed, and it makes you feel for them as they navigate this maze of lies, deception, and crime.

 

If you like good writing that touches you, that grips you and keeps you turning the pages until the end, then this is another good","


Hide and Seek is a mystery novel from the pen of Alan Bradley, the pseudonym for the late author Ian Rankin. The story is primarily set in Croydon, but there are a number of London locations throughout. This book is part of a series with a similar name that started with Hide and Seek. The rest of the series includes another novel and a prequel novella. The main character in this series is called Lola Caplar and moves around London with her friends and family. Lola has to move away from home when her parents separate and this separation causes tension between her and her mother.


Characters

Emma ""Evie"" Coppard (young adult): A 16-year-old girl who has a knack for getting into trouble and prefers to do things on her own. She is the second-boldest girl in her year at school, and is considered to be a leader by her peers and the school staff. 

Jim Coppard (adult): Emma's (Evie) uncle, the second-youngest of six children, who tries to make Evie feel like she does not have a place in the family and treats her as if she is an inconvenience. He is not particularly close to his family and has issues with authority.


Lola Caplar (young adult): A 10-year-old child who lives in Croydon and has a close and loving relationship","

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale:

Total sentences: 6.8

Total words: 7.8

Total syllables: 8.1

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale considers words per sentence, sentences per text, and words per sentence. 

Overall, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is difficult as the text has a lot of sentences and a lot of syllables which is not favourable. However, the narrative is very well constructed as there is a story throughout the text and the characters and their interactions are developed.  The story is also entertaining which helps with the reading score.

" But it is clear that the author is fond of him as a person. Her enthusiasm and belief in her creation are both infectious and compelling.

'I started out writing very short stories,' she tells Barbara. 'As I got into them I realised I didn't need more than a page or two to work out what had happened and so they became mysteries.' They are mysteries with clues leading to the solution, but the clues are more than just clues to be worked out. The authors brilliance in formulating them is what makes them unique.

She reveals that one of her clearest and most satisfying recent examples is the novel 'The House of the Wolf'. It begins: 'When the child in the fairy tale opens its eyes the sun is shining and it is summer.' It is that simple, but the story contains many layers of narrative which make it the remarkable novel it is. But this is not just a one-off phenomenon. Barbara Michaels tells Barbara that her 'favourite recent discovery, and very pleasurable to write, is the psychological puzzle novel - where a mystery emerges as you go deeper into the text'. She says that she also has a special affection for the so-called 'heartstopper' - the novel which is very long but which, she says, is still a page-turner because 'there are just so many twists and turns, and just as you think you have got it all, suddenly you have not'. Her novels tend"," Barbara Michaels, the pen name used by the English novelist Phyllis MacLaney, says that she began to write mysteries as a way of relieving marital strife. As a former Head of Girls' School she was frustrated by the lack of high-profile female authors writing for the mass market. ‘Authors of thrillers just don't produce enough women who can actually write good women.'

Barbara says she decided to assume another identity to increase the chances of her books being turned down for publishers, but she kept referring to Adam Dalgliesh as ‘Barbara’. She admits, 'I hated the name Barbara. My friends would tease me. ""Barbara Barbara."" I couldn't bear it. So I gave myself a new name and adopted a new identity. My publishers agreed to my new name, which was Phyllis Dorothy.' It is from Phyllis Dorothy that Barbara Michaels' name is now derived. Barbara has never set eyes on Adam Dalgliesh but her imagination is brilliant and she uses his name and background in her stories.

Barbara explains, 'I have a problem with names. I can't keep them. My friend, the author T. C. Boyle, says it is a sign of good writing. Names must be ephemeral. They should leave no trace on the imagination, they should be just there and faintly sweet. My own opinion is that most authors like to keep their names"," The comparison is made to highlight Adam Dalgliesh’s many virtues which she herself does not always employ: he is highly intelligent, tenacious and morally upright.

This shy woman, who has excelled in her chosen profession despite the handicap of being a woman, shows humility before Adam Dalgliesh when describing him: ‘I am very flattered that you should think me so good an admirer of yours. I don’t think I am so good an admirer.’ It’s true that Dalgliesh is not the most original author but Barbara Michaels has become the most renowned of his admirers.

Dalgliesh’s natural curiosity and thirst for knowledge leads him to read Barbara Michaels’ book ‘Memoirs of a Murderer’ and so Barbara Michaels’ life is in some ways ‘serendipitously’ connected with that of Barbara Taylor Bradford, the actual Barbara Michaels. The book, which details how Bradford was convicted of the murder of two children, proved a best seller and led to the appointment of Adam Dalgliesh to investigate the case.

What do P.D. James and Barbara Michaels have in common? They are both women who have dedicated their lives to writing crime fiction, a field in which the early deaths of Dame Agatha Christie and D.H. Lawrence had a profound influence. Although they have written different novels, Dalglies"," 'I had a bit of a streak of misogyny in me, I'm afraid. I'm afraid I was a very cold person. And that comes over.' Barbara Michaels suggests that she 'hasn't lived her life very much as a woman, in fact’. For Barbara, who has had a number of careers and titles including Miss Barbara Michaels, Miss USA, Miss Universe, and Chief of Protocol at the United Nations and a former Miss World, this may well be true. But I believe it is true for the crime writer, too.

Barbara Michaels goes on to explain that in one of the books she wrote a police officer, Adam Dalgliesh, was called Bruno. 'So I was Bruno for about two years, I don’t know exactly how long.’ She says it was the time she spent away from home and studying at school, where she was a teacher’s assistant, and the fact that her real name wasn’t Barbara. ‘It was ridiculous!’ she laughs, and admits to becoming fond of the name Bruno. ‘But it was another form of misogyny.’ I believe that misogyny is at the heart of crime writing as a genre and is also true for Barbara Michaels.

","

The Dalgliesh character may draw inspiration from the author's former self, she says, but she also believes he 'has other facets. He doesn’t really know who he is. He was taken from one family and dropped into another. And then he is drawn to a very complex woman. There has to be more to his life than meets the eye. And of course she is not really in his life for his qualities. He just likes the excitement of a new mystery’.

‘Exciting’, certainly is the character's definition of what 'life' is to Adam Dalgliesh. He leaves a mundane office job to become a detective. Then it seems like the mystery has been solved. But instead, the solution merely postpones the inevitable. The quest to understand his personal quest continues.

'My novels are like puzzles, where you have to be very clever to figure out what’s going on. A character will step out of context and there you are with a cliffhanger. You’ve got to wait a few episodes for him to do that again. Then you know what’s going on! You have to be careful not to reveal everything. I would rather let the characters create their own mysteries than have them solved for me. And of course I have to have a sense of humour about it all. The novels sell themselves!’

And indeed, 'The Last Witness', 'The House on the Strand', 'The"," Her own upbringing, as a young woman raised as a man in the army, undoubtedly had its advantages: 'I was treated like a man - a big man'. It is not just her physical attributes that are at variance with her gender. Barbara Michaels, as Barbara is known in the novels, is portrayed as being unflatteringly and uncomfortably feminine.

From the first moments of their meeting, it seems that Barbara is completely at home around Adam, the more dominant of the two. Their interaction makes for interesting reading and raises interesting questions. Who is in control here? Who is in fact the woman? Adam himself does not reveal this but his gaze seems to tell a different story. He watches Barbara's every move with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. He does not take to her immediately but instead takes the opportunity to size up her companions. He even has a little sally about the room with a much younger woman in tow. Adam, like Barbara, is not openly hostile but he does not make any attempt to engage her in conversation. As Barbara wanders away, Adam seems to sense that he has scored a point. He then seems momentarily surprised to see Barbara reappear and appear more flirtatious, clearly unencumbered by gender conventions. 

Barbara's attitude to men is no secret and she is quick to point out that she was ‘raised' by men. Barbara herself had an idyllic childhood, living with her grandparents and","

Barbara Michaels then introduces Adam Dalgliesh to the A2 reader, who recalls a phrase from her English course: ‘It is easy to envisage’.  

Dalgliesh explains that ‘It is easy to envisage’ is a way to encourage pupils to consider an abstract idea and then draw their own conclusion, by contrast with the common instruction ‘Consider what you have read’. He adds that this is why James has several such phrases in her novels: ‘They keep the reader on tenterhooks’. ‘They keep you on your toes’. ‘They make you want to turn the pages’.

Barbara Michaels adds that the phrase was inspired by an old teacher of hers. ‘It was she who had first taught me the phrase, when we had been talking of “imagining” - of course, I remember now.’

Adam Dalgliesh explains that the phrase ‘It is easy to envisage’ was first used by James in a detective story published in 1983, ‘A Cornish Mystery’. It was later adopted by the British Crime Writers’ Association for its annual ‘Cadborosaurus’ award, now worth £5000.

Dalgliesh explains that the phrase is also used in other books written by Barbara Michaels, including ‘The Quiet Ones’ and ‘Memoirs of a Murdered Machine’.

After the meeting Barbara Michaels recalls her"
" I’m really happy to be here and competing, that’s what we’re here for. And to win an award is a brilliant feeling. I’m also delighted to be the first woman in the men’s field so far” B. Katherine 50 basketball player “It’s an honor to play basketball at the highest level and with all the best basketball players in the world. My favorite part is when a shot goes in and you have a crowd on their feet, that makes it even better. I love this sport because it lets you use your body and be a part of a team, you’re working as a team to get a specific result.

Its also great fun doing splits and cartwheels. I love the challenges it presents and overcoming challenges is very important to me. My coaches are the best and I’m so lucky to have them with me, they push me every day"," I trained for six years for my snowboard Olympics so you just go in with a positive attitude.” 

B. Laura 18 runner “I’ve always loved running and I went to school doing extra lessons so I could do a race every weekend. My parents’ encouraged me and I’ve just kept going from there. It’s very competitive and it’s hard to get into but I’m loving it.” 

C. Liz 33 swimmer “You get very little sleep but when you swim all your emotions go out the window. When you’re doing your warm up you’re thinking ‘I’ve done this 10 times before. How do I do this again?’ But when you get in the water and it’s your own little world you forget all your problems. I’ve swum across the English Channel and swam in the sea off the coast of Spain. If I have to swim one more yard I’m going swimming!”

Back in the early years everyone said I’m not good enough but I knew I was just a bit out of my comfort zone. I started skiing when I was seven years old after I watched a TV advertisement.

Justine 28 cyclist “The first time I felt out of my comfort zone was when I started cycling. I started when I was 12. My parents bought me a bike and I’ve never looked back. I’ve won silver and bronze medals at world championships and world cups, and in 2017 I became the first British woman to compete at the Summer Olympic Games. There’s still a long way to go though,"," I also love the challenge.

Eilidh 36 handball player “I love everything about handball, the teamwork, the fitness. My team are growing and going from strength to strength and we’re now at the Euro Women’s final so fingers crossed.

C1 text:

Women on a winning streak To excel in any sport is hard enough even far men but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records."
" Everyone will know about it. It will get trending on Facebook. I will become a famous billionaire overnight."" 
I was speechless. Mr. Phelan had promised to take care of me. The will was a way to keep me in the loop, to help me get out of debt. So I agreed to help him with the case. We created a fake lawsuit. 
One week later, Mr. Phelan's lawyer called me to tell me I passed the bar. Mr. Phelan was so happy. I was relieved. 
We had to meet to formalize the agreement. We were both happy to be reunited and he was all over me. But when it came to the legal part, I started to see red. He was trying to trick me. He didn't want to let me out of his will. I wasn't stupid. I figured it out. He was trying to cheat me.
Mr. Phelan died of a heart attack a couple of weeks later and I was in trouble. My lawyers had to help me with the will to make sure the creditors don't get their hands on me. I never saw Mr. Phelan again. 

If Mr. Phelan had lived, he would have been mad as hell and would have filed a lawsuit against his lawyer for malpractice.


How to spot a scam: 
Scammers will try to take advantage of your good will to get money"," People will donate money to the lawyer's to help him win. It'll be a big story and then the Phelan estate will finally have to admit they can't afford to keep everyone so all their properties get sold to make ends meet. But you'll get the mansion and all the money. You'll get a lot. So I hope you keep all the money and don't spend a dime. I don't like it when people spend money they haven't earned. I like to keep things just for me, and make everyone else do the work so I don't have to do any myself. It's a hard way to make money. You could try it. It wouldn't be for long though. I could get in touch with my old friends. They'll make sure I get my share soon. And then we can go to Disney World and the movies. I'll get to see the special effects, and it'll be like a special treat for me. There's nothing special about Disney World. I like going to Disneyland a lot better. It's quieter, and you can walk around. We'll go at night so you can see the stars. You'll have a better view of the sky than any of these screens back home. Disney World is probably much nicer but it'll be hard to find. Disneyland has a map with the route you need to go on it. I remember having to go around the block a few times. But they have"," The judge will hear it and so will the prosecutor. If you and the other lawyers get enough attention and money from the will, none of the losers will get anything. Everyone will get money from the will. If you all get sued, the defense will blame the kids and you'll have to pay their legal fees. You may have to pay Mr. Phelan's legal fees. That may be a problem. But you got played and this is how it plays out.""


I had to agree with him.


The prosecutor and the judge will be worried about the will's fairness. And they will take into account who's helping the contesting heirs. The defense lawyer will make sure to paint the kids as ungrateful losers. He will ask for huge legal fees, which will only add more debts to the heirs' files. I imagine that the children, who are just kids after all, will take the case against all the odds.


""You have no idea how much I know about this case. But I need to ask you one thing, Mr. Phelan is his name?"" ""Yes."" ""And you were his business partner?"" ""Yes. And his best friend."" ""And your family is rich?"" ""Yes. He took care of my family for many years before I started to realize what he was doing to my mom and the rest of the family.""


Mr. Phelan was definitely crazy. He was so"," You know, that big pay day that some people never get."" ""But that could be my inheritance! I can't accept this."" ""The will doesn't change the facts. It just makes you a richer person. You've been ripped off by a bunch of greedy lawyers, and you'll get your money back. And you'll get to do this huge TV special where you say what a bunch of cheats the lawyers are."" ""But won't that make the lawyers look bad and hurt their business?"" ""Hire more lawyers, stupid."" ""But those lawyers are my friends!"" ""Friends betray friends. It doesn't matter. You can't keep up this friendship."" ""But Mr. Phelan was my friend! He's in his will. He promised that I'd get his money."" ""Mr. Phelan was a fool. Everyone knows that. Look at this letter he wrote! He promised you this and this and this, but he really only gave you this. And this. And this."" ""But I really thought he wanted me to have all this money!"" ""That's the problem! How many people think they're going to get rich. When the facts are very different. People believe what they want and they don't think things through. Look at all the promises he made. Most of them are probably not real. He was very sick. He was depressed. He was trying to impress you with all this great stuff he was going to give you"," And then you'll find out that the parents are broke as well."" ""But how do you know that?"" ""I've seen the books. I know how much money they spent on lawyers in the last few years and that doesn't include the lawyer for the will. That's another who'll get rich from it. So I know."" ""That doesn't prove that the parents are broke."" ""Maybe not. But I'm not the jury and neither are you."" ""Why does that matter?"" ""Well, because I'll do my best to convince them and you'll do yours to discredit me. It doesn't matter which one of us is right. It only matters that we say we saw it with our own eyes."" ""So you're saying I should believe you even though you're not from the legal profession and you're not a lawyer?"" ""I'm not saying that at all. But I could be the key to convincing the jury. You could help me by saying that you believe me too."" ""I suppose I could. And I suppose I could get rich if the will is successful. That would make this story worthwhile."" ""And who says you won't get rich?"" ""Well, I'm still not going to tell you that. But let's find out together first."" ""All right. I'll tell you what I know."" ""Great. Let's go to my house."" 

The narrative above can be reworded to better suit the English language."," I'll make sure of it."" ""And me?"" ""You'll do the filing. And you'll mail the papers for me to sign. I can't do that from here. We'll have to go inside."" He took me inside. The house looked very cold. It was dark and cold and all I could see were millions of money signs everywhere. ""The room where they do the will. All these boards are walls of cash. They don't want to leave any room for anything else."" He pulled out a chair for me. It looked very hard and uncomfortable. I didn't like it. ""Sit down. This may be a long visit."" I sat down and started to feel a chill going down my spine. I was feeling very nervous and not from the cold. ""Now we'll start. The first board is the one with the will itself. You should read it very carefully and then sign it here on the blank line below this last paragraph. 'The testator states that all his worldly goods and possessions are divided equally among his 3 daughters A, B and C.' What does that mean?"" ""Well, the will splits the house in three and gives each of his daughters a part of the money he made from the house."" ""How much?"" ""A piece for A, B for B and C for C."" ""That's not fair to B and C. They worked harder for this money and have a right to more. We should divide it more equally"," This will be a huge win for me."" ""Well, he was a little crazy but he had a point. They've lost their inheritance and have to get the money through a messy and expensive will contest."" ""This is crazy! I can't let my lawyers spend their time in that crap. We're going to take care of everything, you'll see. The estate will stay in the family. You and the girls will be the heads of the company, we'll give you generous salaries and huge perks. I will stay with my girlfriend and dedicate all my time to the company. We'll live like kings.""

Text assessed as B1 level:

I saw a lot of things he said. The visit was about money and the topic of the meeting was wills. Mr Phelan promised that he will take care of me in his will. There were many promises all broken. Mr Phelan was crazy. He was or he wasn't. Doesn't matter to me. This is the way I see it. Because they're heavily in debt, the kids have to contest the will. No jury is going to feel sorry for them. They're a bunch of greedy losers. It'll be a tough case to win. But you and the other lawyers will attack the will and you'll create this huge lawsuit that gets in the newspaper. This will be a huge win for me. Mr Phelan was a little crazy but he had a point"
" ‘How on earth did they get in here?’ I thought to myself. ‘This isn’t an ideal location.’ It was soon clear they must have stumbled across the old chicken run — a series of wooden runs built to facilitate the hens’ egg-laying process — and as I looked around the dairy farm’s open fields, which were just becoming grazed, I couldn’t help but think, ‘Who’s been messing about?’ Then as I watched, a grey and white badger cub climbed onto a freshly dead sheep and with a loud thwack, the sheep’s carcass fell to the ground. ‘Wow, they are adorable,’ I thought as I heard the cubs mew at the fallen meat. But my reaction wasn’t just based on their appearance. They had come to our dairy farm after being rehomed by a farmer in nearby Chinnor. It was the kindness of that farmer, who was only too happy to give them a second chance at life, that brought us to them; he told us about their ordeal in the wild and how they would be well looked after on our farm. And so we were. ‘Oh my,’ I thought to myself again as I watched a second badger cub explore the sheep’s entrails, and the third started cleaning herself while the first two watched with interest. Although they had come from a stressful situation, they were now completely safe on our farm and would go on to"," As we moved them into the adjacent pen, each nuzzled and pawed at their new surroundings, the thought crossed my mind: ‘What a pity!’. The cubs were about to learn an unfortunate lesson in life…

One of our badgers (a female) had her litter the previous autumn and we felt that she had learnt her lesson and that we could let her go back into the wild. In March, however, our fence had just been rebuilt and was now six inches higher than before. As soon as the cubs heard the sound of traffic and saw the fence coming towards them they panicked. One made for the far end of their pen; the other two made for the fence but got tangled up. When their mother realised what was happening, she tried her best to free them but sadly they were in too much of a panic to succeed. And so ended their short lives.

Of the three cubs, only one survived. The other two died of shock. I know that badgers are not the cute cartoon characters portrayed in popular culture but I’m still very sad to think of them suffering the fate that befell these little ones. And now I know that in Somerset we have a badger cull - a policy we inherited from the prior owner of our dairy farm - and that the cubs have lost their lifeline. That’s how badger badger badgers.

THE STORY BEGINS: Brought up"," I scooped the little ones up one by one and carried them back into the house where we had arranged a play area in the upstairs room where they could explore. I’d never seen grey badgers before — the smallest type of badger, they’re also called grey moose as they share many physical characteristics with the Asian moose — but in my rural community we know these gentle creatures are part of the family as they help to keep pest numbers down. Soon our little ones were exploring the toys, sniffing and nuzzling each other and I could not help but wonder: what now? Badgers are the smallest of the three bear family species and have very long legs and short fur. In this case their paws were covered in flea bites but the moment the little ones saw us they let out a series of loud barks. Derek and I immediately knew what to do. We’d be taking good care of them; we’d buy them some tasty tidbits of chicken, rabbit and squirrel from the farm shop and find them a suitable den so they could fend for themselves. I’d watched enough wildlife documentaries to know we had little to fear and soon one of the little ones came over to check out our new friends. It was clear this relationship was to be a close one with the cub nuzzling and licking the one on the ground. ‘There’s plenty of room for all of them in the den I’ve built"," And while I was keen to learn more about the three babies I saw outside, I also couldn’t resist teasing them. “Well, I hope you realise that that noise you are making will soon be coming from your teeth,” I warned my little friends. “Oh yeah,” they nodded. 
From the start we encountered opposition from the farmers at my school, with the headteacher describing the open farm as “unorthodox”. As a Grade 2 student, I understood the importance of ensuring that what I learned is factual and not just an opinion or personal viewpoint. Fortunately for me, the opposition was just that: personal viewpoint, not an educational one. 
One of the local farmers — known for his work with rescued grey squirrels — took the orphans on a short hike to see how they would fare out in the wild. The cubs were quick to learn — the squirrel rescue man didn’t need to explain how to forage for nuts — and soon returned from their foraging adventure with many large and numerous squirrel scoff. Their cheeks were full and their coats had a few straggly hairs, the better to collect a morsel of squirrel meat between them. It was a proud moment for them all. They were free to roam, they were fed, they were being rescued and now they were big squirrels. To take full advantage of their newfound freedom, the badgers decided to explore one of the nearby abandoned farm"," ‘Oh my,’ I breathed, a mixture of delight and shock quickly spreading across my face. ‘Let me see, I think we have a mother badger, three orphan cubs, and some orphaned rabbits, we can rehouse them.’ The box cackled again and two of the cubs began wailing. I gently scooped up the rabbits and took them to Derek, who was holding the badger. ‘These are our orphaned rabbits,’ I explained, showing him the wire hutch on my hip that contained the box. ‘These came running across the field when I was taking photos and I’ve been trying to catch them but they’re fast.’ The badger wailed some more and rubbed her face on Derek’s jeans. He lifted her gently out of his arms, rubbed her back and then held her by the neck to look into her eyes. ‘She’s crying because she misses her little nest,’ he explained with a small smile. I moved to the hutch and opened the door to reveal three small grey badgers and a pile of sticks and twigs as their new home. The cubs ran around, sniffed at everything and began cleaning themselves using their long, bushy tails. ‘I think they’ll make good pets,’ I told Derek when he returned. ‘They’ll need some TLC with regular exercise, and they’ll be very well looked after here. I hope you can find somewhere for them to"," ‘How do you know they’re badgers?’ I asked my helpers. ‘They have badgerDNA,’ replied my colleague Claire, who had handed me the box. These three are the offspring of a cross with three mother badgers. ‘It was only last month that we were told that our farm was home to a breeding population of badgers,’ I continued. ‘We now have six badgers, all mothers, in a den we’ve built — all safe and happy.’ Claire responded, ‘And this brings up badgers! They’re amazing, they live in den like animals and there’s so much you can do with them.’ ‘They’re not badgers!’ I insisted, though inside I was laughing with relief. ‘They are!’ Claire laughed back. ‘But they’re mother badgers — their cubs are their babies.’ ‘They should be neutered and spayed,’ I said, my laughter subsiding. ‘They’re badgers!’ Claire replied. ‘How do you know they’re badgers?’ I asked again. Claire sighed. ‘I just know.’ I smiled at my colleague and shook my head. ‘How do you know?’ Claire asked. ‘Their badgerDNA,’ she replied. ‘They’re badgers!’ I replied, louder this time. Claire laughed. ‘It was only last month that we were told that our farm was home to a breeding population of badgers.’ She replied,"," 

‘They’re not badgers’ my colleague explained as the sound got closer. ‘They’re grey squirrels and they’re being helped by a wild mother.’

‘Oh... what are they called?’ 

‘We’ll know them by their tails. The three smallest have tail-strips like the little girl.’

‘Oh, I love those’ I agreed. ‘They remind me of squirrels at home.’

We’ve all been surprised by the generosity of wild animals. Last week a pair of red deer ambled into our field on our walk to lunch and started nibbling at the grass at our feet. When we turned back the deer were long gone but a field mouse was huddling on the underside of our gate. ‘The deer aren’t the only kind of animal I’ve met that’s friendly’ my colleague explained. ‘We’ve also had a young red deer mother and her fawn. It was lovely to watch and definitely heartwarming.’

It was all very exciting but now, what do we do with these cute little squirrels? I considered this as another box was passed towards me.

‘We’ll give them away’ I suggested. ‘They’re lovely.’

‘No, we have to return them to the wild’ she countered. ‘Their mothers will be worried and we need to make sure they’re not"
" When asked how negative reviews could affect sales authors offered a range of responses. Some saw no effect at all whilst others offered suggestions on how to improve the article for example length or content for example being negative about the cover art rather than criticising the content of the book. Some examples of changes that have been recommended include: more information about the book in the review, including author interviews for example. A couple of authors commented that they thought reviews were an excellent source of free publicity and often resulted in sales in itself. This may well be true.


Publishers also think that positive reviews can also have a direct positive affect on sales, as these readers will share these reviews. A couple of authors commented that they also thought negative reviews harmed sales as these readers would be deterred from buying if they thought the book had poor reviews.


When asked about the value of reviews there is often a common theme around how the content of the review will influence the reader buying a book. This ranges from whether the reviewer liked the book or not to whether the reviewer thought the book was useful or interesting, etc. etc.


In summary what can be said is that reviews are key for both publishers and authors in their decision to publish or write a book and are arguably more important for authors especially if they are authors of a more artistic nature.


How the reviews of a book can impact its commercial success.


Yes, reviews are very important for both publishers and authors in deciding whether or"," 

Publishers were more upbeat about the effects of the reviews of their books.  They suggested that whilst there had been a small dip in sales caused by the negative reviews, the reviews were more widely published and made available via online and mobile devices which meant the reviews had a broader impact:

""It has really hit home to me as to how many times the reviews appeared in the papers and how many copies readers got. I don't know if you saw the piece in The Times last week?"" said Rob Dopping, CEO of Hachette UK (e-book only publisher)
""We have had a slight drop in sales caused by the negative reviews but this is balanced out by the more general nature of the reviews, which give us a much broader base of readership than before."" said Simon Clark, Publisher for Harper Collins (all formats)

However both publishers were concerned that the reviews were not tailored for different devices or categories of readers so whilst the reviews were widely published this approach was less helpful for young readers. One publisher believed that this may have been the reason why the BookTrust has started a scheme where they are selling specially adapted editions of books to different group - e.g. young readers could have a text adapted for younger readers.

""We have been surprised at the limited effectiveness of the reviews (for young readers in particular) and believe the lack of tailoring to devices or reader groups is the reason for this. We will continue"," So, we know that reviews are vital for a book's commercial success. But how do they work? According to publishers, once the manuscript is approved and sent to a contracted agent to place authors will find their first reviews in a couple of weeks. Then, it will take a couple of weeks more before books are listed in leading trade and educational bookshops. From there, it takes a few more weeks before a book actually appears on Amazon etc. - and then a further few weeks before it actually appears on sale. Then, and this is crucial, publishers say, the reviews have an immediate effect on sales. Somewhere around a third say reviews have no immediate effect, but the rest think reviews have some immediate effect that can be measured by sales of subsequent editions of the same book - whether or not the original purchaser subsequently buys a subsequent edition. In any event, there seems to be a connection between reviews (for example, negative reviews are often from people who have bought the book so they're more likely to be positive) and sales of subsequent editions. It is hard to prove a direct link here. However, although we don't really know why reviews work they do work. And the book marketing council have found that when companies are asked why they buy things it is almost always reviews that come up. Book marketing council ""In a survey of 600 readers conducted for us in May 2011, it was found that 80 per cent purchase books based on reviews, 18 per cent on price, 4"," Authors are not quite so forgiving and tend to be quite critical of reviews as a whole. But again it is the positive and negative reviews that help generate interest in books and can ultimately help sell them. In particular authors appreciate the reviews which help them identify which genres to write in and those which highlight particular features of books like illustrations or layout.

DO REVIEWS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY? Some say reviews are an author's dream; others say that authors are disappointed by them; still others are less sure. According to a 2003 survey by the Book Marketing Council, published by Prometheus Books, 60% of book buyers look at book reviews.

DO REVIEWS MATTER? Yes, reviews matter a lot. According to a 2003 survey by the Book Marketing Council, published by Prometheus Books, 60% of book buyers look at book reviews.

HOW DOES REVIEWS HAPPEN? Readers can find books by scanning titles in electronic databases, browsing used book stores, or scanning book covers at the library. Once a reader finds a book that interests them, they can order it from the book store by checking the title and author on an electronic database and then visiting the book store to order the book. Alternatively, the reader can contact the book's publisher for details. The author's Web site or a link to the site in the book might also be useful.

When the book is purchased, the reader will then receive"," At the same time they acknowledge that it can also be harmful - author reaction can be unpredictable with some getting so angry at review that they may cancel the project! However, the author's point about the need for balanced reviews is widely accepted. An example of balanced review is: Reviewer 1: This reviewer felt the story was powerful and well told, but felt there was too much mystery surrounding certain events. Reviewer 2: Based on the review, the author seems to have successfully conveyed both the hero’s journey and the larger world view which provided a convincing contrast between the former and the latter. The above review indicates that both positive and negative reviews are considered balanced. However, authors may argue that if Reviewer 2 in this case is an “established expert in the field”, then Reviewer 1’s lack of familiarity with the same subject area may have deterred her from providing balanced feedback. In addition, Reviewer 2’s acknowledgment of the author’s skill and effort (in this instance writing with an “easy reader” text on a complex subject) is an implicit endorsement of the work. As authors we can agree that reviews are an important part of selling books and need to be objective, fair and balanced.

A2: Author's reaction to a negative review might be unpredictable. Author's point about the need for balanced reviews is widely accepted.

The above narrative can also be repeated for: DO BOOKS PUBLISHERS SUPPORT REVIEWS?"," Authors feel that authors alone cannot sell books. The number one fear we hear is that the reviews will damage the book's reputation. So many books fail to break through thanks to reviews. The reviews do not necessarily have to be glowing - a negative review from a respected bookseller can actually be more influential than an enthusiastic review from a reviewer who has never heard of the book.

From personal experience, I can attest to that. I found and purchased The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller on the strength of a single negative Amazon review. My family was ecstatic, especially my father, and the book is now a permanent fixture on our living room bookshelf.

The Book Marketing Council found some years ago that when questioned on why we had bought a particular hook more people cited reviews than any other prompting influence (advertisements word of mouth bookshop display etc.).

DO REVIEWS ALWAYS CORRELATE TO PRICE WISELY? No - the number of books sold by a publisher cannot be predicted using only the number of reviews. In fact, there is typically an inverse correlation where the fewer reviews there are the more money the publisher makes for the author.

DO REVIEWS INFLUENCE BUYER'S PERSONALITY? Yes, although the number of reviews does not determine the amount of money an author recieves, reviews and recommendations of a book will often influence whether the buyer chooses to purchase a particular book.

DO REVIEWS ALWAYS CORRELATE TO PRICE UNEVENLY? No, in fact there is a positive correlation where more expensive books have more reviews and recommendations. The Book Marketing Council found that the more advanced and sophisticated the book, the more effective reviews were in influencing buyers to spend money.


DO REVIEWS HELP AUTHORS ADDRESS CRITICISM? Authors often benefit from reviewing books that generate negative feedback for example on customer service, product quality, accuracy or general bad press. Reviews can also influence the writing process by providing constructive feedback on style, structure or language.  

DO REVIEWS INFLUENCE BOOKSELLER'S PRICE? Yes, the Book Marketing Council also found that the correlation was inverse where the more positive a publisher made a book, the less money they generated"
" A cockerel was first introduced by the British Army during the American Civil War. The new shape was meant to be easier to build and more readily visible from a distance. But the cockerel also had its drawbacks: it was easy to identify and required a lot of material to make it. ‘A cockerel weighs at least 2kg and takes several days to make. What I have to offer is much more discrete and interesting. I think I have made an improvement by the look of it.’ The cockerel’s ancestry goes back to Roman times and the ancient Egyptians. But today we find a host of different designs. Not everyone prefers a cockerel, for example. ‘I know at least a couple of men who do not like them any more. In my studio there is an exhibition of old weathervanes. Some are even more original than the cockerel I designed. My customers are not only women but people of all ages. So we can find the right design for every situation.’

Weathervanes, or weather horns, are instruments used to predict the weather.  They are typically made of bronze, cast in the shape of a cockerel.  They are often adorned with precious metal plaques that depict the design of the cockerel.  Weathervanes were used as early as Egyptian and ancient Greek times and have been a part of Western culture and history since that time.  The cockerel design is"," ‘The cockerel is very traditional, very bland’ says Graham. ‘It lacks personality. People want something distinctive. They want to know what it is about their man or woman who buys this particular type of weathervane.’ One recent customer was interested in buying a weathervane with the words ‘Happy B-Day Mum’ hand-carved on the top. ‘Mum’s been very supportive. She has actually given me this idea for a birthday present for her. I have to admit I was hesitant at first. After all, who better to commission a custom made gift than Mum? But I took a deep breath and went for it and after a series of complex calculations I have now decided that it will be cheaper to buy a standard cockerel for £20 instead of making the mum the owner of a unique and bespoke personalized gift. ‘But why?’ I hear you cry. After all why not commission a standard cockerel in the first place. The reason is that a cockerel will appear at best quite dated and indeed stereotypically English soon after purchase unless an owner puts considerable time and thought into refining its design. In contrast a hand-carved weathervane, or hornet, as it is known in the trade, has the option of a single inscription or a more detailed list of choices to personalize the design. The bespoke element appeals to Graham who has commissioned a unique and very personalized gift for his"," 

Graham, who is in his 60s, learned the craft from his father who was an engraver. At school, the subject was not offered. In his own words: ‘The next logical step was to go into the Civil Service, where the only thing available was to punch a form in a machine. That was OK until I was in my 50s, at which point I suddenly realised that I really had something to look forward to.’ 

Graham now owns a business in the center of Gloucester called Smithcrafts Ltd. His customers include craft-show and craft-fair organisers and members of the public. ‘The weathervanes are very popular, which is also good from a marketing perspective, because I can show them off on social media.’ The vanes are created from bronze and are fitted with an axle, a wooden cap, the design and a glass frit. ‘The glass is sandblasted, which makes it hard, shiny and scratch resistant. It is possible to choose different woods for the cap. I like oak because it is a good wood for the bronze to adhere to. I have also made versions in ash, cherry and walnut. Some people buy weathervanes made of copper, which is also an option. My copper ones are more expensive, but if you consider the environmental impact of using copper, it makes sense to use something that is less damaging to the environment. ‘One item is roughly the same price as another"," ‘The cockerel is old fashioned,’ Graham points out. ‘If you go to a pub in Essex you can see the weathervanes from many of the local families. The design is very English.’ Weathervanes have many uses: in addition to signalling the approach of a new day they are also used as fun and decorative objects. Graham is a craftsman with a keen eye for a design. He carefully examines drawings and sketches provided by the customer in order to produce a highly individual piece. He has a broad technical background having studied Civil Engineering at Aston University and later worked for a structural engineer. In his own words: ‘I’ve always enjoyed designing and making things.’ In the workshop of Graham Smith, Ltd. there are all the necessary materials and equipment to realise his ambitions: a computer assisted design system allows for the swift production of detailed plans as well as the manufacturing of the final product. One of the company’s specialities are hand-cut weathervanes which require a highly developed eye and great precision to realise. Hand-cut weathervanes are custom-made for customers with specific requirements and are manufactured in small to medium volume. The material requirements for hand-cut weathervanes are typically wood with suitable adhesives or mortice and tenon joints and brass or bronze fittings. These weathervanes can range from 3 to 6 inches in height. ‘I am aiming for a minimum order of 20 pieces,’ explains Graham. ‘These can then be"," ‘When I designed my first one, I wanted to copy the traditional design and copy the old Dutch style of moulding, but in my own way. I wanted to add an animal element but couldn’t think of a bird. I was looking at pictures of animals when I saw the cockerel. When I saw the cockerel, it made sense to me!’ With that, Graham begins to weave a tale of a cockerel’s redemption. ‘I started out making them for friends and my customers but I soon found that my designs were also very popular on the internet, thanks to the wide use of the internet and social media these days. So I went into business for myself.’

WEATHERVANE MAKER Graham Smith began making his first designs in the 1980s, in the upstairs of his home, which he now no longer owns. He now has a workshop in the county, where he can follow detailed designs on a computer and then start to take his work forward, first producing a two-sided sheet of metal that is then cut by a laser cutter to create the design. Graham also relies on traditional hand-tools for the cutting of the metal sheets, along with a sanding drum and grinding wheel, to complete the job. ‘I started out using traditional tools, but the laser cutter is great for making small parts with high precision.’ Like many of his peers in the business, Graham’s design is moulded from aluminium and is"," ‘That was always going to be an inferior design,’ says Graham. ‘You can see it in the Bible.’ He points to a few sentences in the Bible that he believes are particularly poor examples of effective English, and he is right. ‘I don’t want to get into a debate on the subject, but the Bible certainly contains many examples of the cockerel design.’ He pauses for a moment, reflecting on the design and visual appeal of a cockerel. ‘It’s very hard to look at something and not think of eggs or chickens.’ His own view is that cockerel is a cliché, and he doesn’t want to use it. ‘If I had a design competition and had to choose between the cockerel and my design, I would surely go for my design.’ ‘Would you? But your design looks so clever!’ I remark, thinking it unlikely that anyone would choose Graham’s design even if the choice were between his design and the cockerel. He shrugs and says: ‘Who knows? One customer might be persuaded.’ But if he won the design competition, would he use a cockerel? ‘I don’t think so.’ ‘That’s good to know.’ We talk about what a cockerel could do to my head.

","  

Ancient Roman soldiers raised a weathervane with arms like this to allow them to see which way was up in battle. In contrast, British weathervanes are purely decorative, often made of silver, and mounted on the front of houses and public buildings. ‘Most of my customers are elderly ladies. They’ve had them for decades and I believe they like that they can still be seen on top of houses’ explains Graham. ‘They also think they add a certain nostalgic charm.’ Indeed, many of the ladies who have commissioned his hand-cut weathervanes have been married for generations, so they don’t need a new design every year as is common with custom built items.  

Despite the fact that he is one of very few people able to make hand-cut weathervanes, Graham has no formal training. He started making these bespoke items in 2006 when he was looking for a challenge. ‘I was intrigued by the historical development of this craft and the variety of designs that were available. I felt that the craft deserved better than the simplistic designs of the past.’ And in that spirit, he started The Weathervane Maker. ‘The idea was to offer an original, bespoke design for each customer. ‘

So far, so good. What’s the next step? Graham now needs to consult with customers to confirm their requirements. Then he must produce the plans electronically and produce the first prototype. As"
" So why are they lying to kids about the risk of smoking? Because they know if they didn't, they would have to do something about it. They'd have to take more efforts to reach kids. So what they did, they killed the demand.""

The documentary is an attempt to reveal the truth of what really happened. Was the smoking epidemic fueled by tobacco companies? The debate raged for decades. A recently published analysis, published in the journal Addiction, concludes ""The overall results of our meta-analysis strongly support the hypothesis that exposure to cigarette advertising contributes to increases in youth smoking."" 

Other critics argue that the epidemic was fueled by the widespread availability of cigarettes, easy access, the marketing of sex appeal, and an absence of regulation or government subsidies.

As of 2023, Rohr and Stucke remained in contact, and Rohr had contributed funds to Stucke's legal defense fund. Rohr died on November 26th 2023 after suffering a heart attack while on a business trip in Shanghai.

What do you call the people who make sure 90 percent of the people vote for the political party that pays them the most money? In this case it's the tobacco companies."" 

In this paragraph, the author is comparing and contrasting the tobacco industry and the advertising industry. 

In the first part of the paragraph, the author outlines some key facts about the tobacco industry and then describes some of the decisions the industry made that led to the industry's targeting of teenagers. The second part of the paragraph summarizes the impact that the industry has on society. The third part of the paragraph compares and contrasts the tobacco industry with the advertising industry. The author explains how the advertising industry learned ""kids"" when it came to marketing decisions, but the tobacco industry instead targeted ""adults"" because it knew ""thousands"" of kids started smoking every day. 

The author develops a series of assertions supported with evidence. Some of the assertions are: 

The tobacco industry spent millions studying kids to understand how to market to them. 

The tobacco industry targeted ""thousands"" of kids each day who started smoking because it knew ""they"" were 90 percent of adult smokers. 

The tobacco industry, through the use of statistical analysis, was able to target ""adults"" with their political funding to be their ""voices in government"" to increase their power. 

The"," You really want to spend a trillion dollars trying to stop smoking with drugs and surgeries? Spend that money on prevention instead."" 

The industry reacted by denouncing the evidence provided by Rohr's team. ""These are political activists. Their primary goal is to scare consumers. They will never be able to convince the public to change the way they consume tobacco."" 

Then Rohr's team released its final report. ""We at the Tobacco Free Kids Foundation are appalled by the industry's attempt to silence us and we won't let them."" 

The industry responded with more ads targeting teenagers. Rohr decided to quit his job and to dedicate himself to the fight against smoking. In 2022 he co-founded Restore. ""Tobacco companies can kill one million people a year. Restore is a big part of the solution.""

 The industry then sued Rohr for libel. But Rohr and Restore won in the Court of public opinion. Rohr's team released a poll showing that 60% of the American public agreed with its findings. The judge in the case even praised the work of Rohr's team, saying ""the defendants' advertising and promotion of their product was indeed aimed at teenagers.""

 But Rohr was still not out of trouble. The judge ordered Rohr to remove all references to Restore from his website. The judge also fined Restore 30,000 dollars.

 Rohr still had to deal with one more problem."," They didn't want to give up the market and so they started running more television advertising, sponsoring more sports events, and they began paying movie stars to make movies about smoking. In the end, we had the best information system money could buy but it still wasn't good enough.""

The narrative continues:

  *   Mark started to run the industry's biggest and most sophisticated research program but he was also running an industry, not a research organization. 
  *   He spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and perhaps even billions, and produced no valid scientific data to suggest that the industry was targeting teenagers. 
  *   He knew the industry was targeting teenagers, but he continued to deny it.

  *   In the end, Mark got exactly what he wanted, because he ran an industry that was targeting teenagers. 
  *   In the end, Mark got exactly what he wanted, because he was able to convince the public that the industry was targeting teenagers.

  *   The tobacco companies did not know that most adult smokers started as teenagers, so their ad campaigns did not cause many teenagers to start smoking. 
  *   Mark did not know that most adult smokers started as teenagers, so his research had no impact on teenage smoking.

Mark was running a sophisticated program to gather information about what cigarettes looked like, how they tasted, and what effect they had on people's health, but he was also running an industry to sell cigarettes.

"," They knew that if they targeted their advertising to teenagers they could increase sales by at least two billion dollars a year. Did you know that most doctors recommend that teenagers don't smoke?  So the tobacco companies got away with killing millions of teenagers and still turning a fortune.""   

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""I'm not sure that I follow,"" said Adam. ""Did the tobacco companies increase cigarette sales by at least two billion dollars a year?""

""That’s right,"" said Rohr. ""That's why they killed millions of teenage smokers and turned a fortune.""

""Wow. That's some advertisement. But it didn't work. Teenage smoking rates haven't gone down since then.""

""That's because you have tens of millions of adults smoking as teenagers,"" said Rohr. ""What do you think they did, switched the adverts around and showed them smoking the less popular brands?""

Adam thought about it for a moment.  ""I suppose you're probably right,"" he said.

""I've been working on the tobacco companies for the last 45 years.  I have the papers to prove it."" Rohr took a breath, gathering his thoughts.  ""The tobacco companies funded some of the top universities in the world to conduct research showing the addictiveness of cigarette smoking.  They convinced the doctors, who should have been fighting against the habit, to promote smoking as safe and healthy.  They convinced the politicians to"," And they want to reach them.""

" The two men rushed towards him. One had a sword in his hand. The other man drew a pistol from his belt. They both attacked Mr Jaggers. But as they were about to stab him he jumped down from a window and I saw him run down the street. I followed and saw him jump into a coach which was waiting. After a short time the coach drove away. I returned to Mr Jaggers's office. A constable told me that a man had stabbed Mr Jaggers, but I did not know who it was.

I followed the man who had attacked Mr Jaggers and saw that he was running down the street with a large knife in his hand. He soon passed a shop. A man came out of the shop. I followed him. He turned into a house. The man returned to the shop and put some distance between them. After a while a woman came out and told the man to go back to the shop. The man went back. I followed.

Then Mr Jaggers turned to me and said, 'Come with me' and took me out into the corridor and asked me to wait. He went to the end of the corridor and stood by the window. He drew the curtains and said, 'Tell the court what has happened.' I told the court that a man and woman had tried to force their way into Mr Jaggers's office and when he had refused to let them in they had pushed him and his clerk aside and assaulted him. Mr Jaggers then returned to his office, slammed the door behind him and I could hear him putting his case and the clerk arguing with the defendant. Finally the judge asked Mr Jaggers to explain his actions. Mr Jaggers replied that he had asked the man and woman to wait and that he was about to close the door when the man and woman tried to force their way in. He said he had pushed them aside to protect the clerk and the court. He was therefore defending himself. Mr Jaggers was found guilty of assault. He received a fine and was sentenced to a day in prison. Later I learnt that the man and woman who had forced their way into Mr Jaggers's office had wanted to talk to him about their case and had offered to pay him to represent them.

Mr Jaggers then returned to his room. A little while later the clerk knocked and said that Mr Jaggers was ready to see me. Mr Jaggers led me into his room and when we had taken our seats at the small table in the corner of the room he said to me, 'your case is interesting. But if I accept it I shall have to call several more witnesses. Do you understand what I mean?' I told him that I did and he said, 'Well I will try your case today but I shall call fewer than I should have if you were a common criminal. I shall not take your case if it is not worth my while. Do you understand what I mean?' I told him that I did and he said, 'Then I will hear your case.'  

The first witness to be called was a man called Moseby who described a fight he had seen between three men in the street the previous day.  

'Did you see the fight between the three men?' asked Mr Jaggers.  
'I did' said Moseby.  
'What did you see?'

It may not be so.' The man said, 'Sir you are doing a great service to your country' then he seized Mr Jaggers by the throat and brought him to the ground.  The man who had spoken to him before stepped forward to help the man who had seized him and they pulled Mr Jaggers away. Then there was a loud cry of 'Justice.' Then Mr Jaggers said, 'It's the king, the king has ordered I be taken care of.' Then a voice called out, 'Attack! Attack!' and the crowd began to push at Mr Jaggers's opponents who were still standing. They began to rush towards Mr Jaggers. Mr Jaggers's opponents rushed at them and many of them fell down. Then Mr Jaggers was seized by several of his opponents and taken away. As he was being carried away he said, 'You will not defeat me with numbers!'

The first narrator is responsible for the information given, such as that Mr Jaggers was five hours from"," They said nothing and looked shamefaced. The rest of the people in the room looked on in silence. He led me from the room to another, darker room. He knocked and said, 'Come in'. I did so and he said, 'I have something to show you.' He unlocked a door and said, 'This way.' I followed him. We went down a dark, narrow stairs. At the bottom he unlocked a heavy door and opened it for me. The room was light. He lit a candle and I saw an open coffin lying on a low table. 'Look' he said pointing to the coffin. 'This is your parents.' He put a hand on my shoulder and we both wept. He led me back upstairs to the people waiting in the room and we all wept together. When we had cried for a long time, he locked the door behind us. He unlocked the door again and said, 'Come back tomorrow.' Weeks went by and then another week. Then one day I went to the coroner's court to see my parents, and they were in the coffin. My parents had taken their last breaths in my arms as they fell asleep. I was taken to the police station and charged with their murder. I was tried and found guilty. Mr Jaggers was the judge, Mr Gulliver was the Crown Prosecutor, and Mr Flinders was the police inspector. I cried for them when they were murdered. Mr Jaggers"," The men bowed their heads and left. 'Now, I have nothing to say to you,' repeated Mr Jaggers. 'This is a bad business altogether,' he said and put his head in his hands and continued to sob.

'Sit down, sit down,' I said, and put a chair for him in front of the fireplace. I asked him who had won the case and he said one of the men had. 'You will never convince me that I won this case,' he said and gave a long sigh. 'How much will you be awarded?' I asked. 'Three hundred pounds,' he answered. 'That is more than I thought it was worth.' I asked him who had won it and he said one of the men had. 'That is a shame, because I thought it was you who would win it.' He looked at me and his eyes filled with tears. 'I am very sorry,' I said and gave him my handkerchief. He wiped his eyes and continued 'One hundred pounds for each of them.' He sat down and said 'that is a lot of money to be awarded for losing a case.' He sniffed a few times and then continued.

I thought that Mr Jaggers had insulted the lady but he said, ""I cannot help it if I am not liked in this town; I am a stranger here"". 

Mr Jaggers then went on to explain to the lady that he was just doing his job. He was an official, and he was just following the procedure to transfer her money. Mr Jaggers then took down her details. He gave her a receipt for the money paid and left the office. When I told Mr Jaggers what had happened, he said, ""That is how it is, things are not always as they seem"". When I asked him if he would have helped the lady if she had not insulted him, he said, ""That is up to her. I do not know what goes on in a person's mind. However, I was there in my official capacity and I will not break the law. I shall be the one punished when it comes to matters of the law."" I then understood what Mr Jaggers meant when he said he was a stranger in a town that he had been hired to administer.

" It was February, well past the traditional training season, but given the recent Kenya election I thought it couldn't hurt to get out into the hills for a few weeks. 

So, I went to Nanyuk. 

But there was no Nerurkar. 

The runners I was tracking were a handful of Kenyan athletes from the Commonwealth Games last year. They arrived at 4am and left well after dark. Over the course of a week I trained with eight of them.

That first night on Nanyuk I sat alone in my tent, watching the aurora borealis over the eastern skyline. I wondered how far I had come: just 20 miles? 50 miles? An hour in the future I could look up and see this beautiful sight, and I could see that I was on the right trail. 

The track soon petered out: there wasn't enough oxygen. In the morning we would have to go by truck, on two-wheel tractors. We were just a few miles from the summit when an explosion tore through the truck, spewing dust and metal shards all over us. 

The last member of the group to return from the track, I told the others to pick it: the track was gone. I was alone again. But I had a plan.

It was the middle of winter, so temperatures were low. I would build a snow cave in a sheltered hollow high up in a nearby"," I chose to join a Kenyan team rather than one based in the United Kingdom. In our first training session the five of us - myself, James Chechet, Daniel Wanjiru, Philip Kiptasa and Caleb Kiptasa - trooped off up the road towards the distant mountains. As we crested a hill I stopped and gasped at what I saw. Ten minutes later we'd reached the crest and from here the view took my breath away. The Kilimanjaro of my childhood had become an Everest; to the north-east, the sharp peaks of the mountainous range which runs through Central Kenya; to the west and south a myriad of other peaks - some snow-covered, some still covered by dense clouds - the rest of the range blurred into the haze. I was witnessing one of the most dramatic changes in scenery which mountains offer. I've climbed on mountains all over the world - in fact, to this day when I'm asked where my favorite mountains are I point to the Himalayas, the Karakoram, Mount Everest, and dozens of lesser known mountains - but none can match the majestic beauty and vastness of this highland world. I'm proud to call Kenyan runners my teammates and to have been given the chance to train at this world-renowned base camp for the Central Highlands. Here we will work on our distance skills, develop our transition between base and peak, and improve our speed. In"," It was not just that I trained with an Englishman: it was the Englishman who was training with Kenyans. To say I was excited would be a gross understatement. But that excitement grew as the miles passed. For the first time in many years I was seeing Kenya and its people with my own eyes. And I was amazed. I have trained with African runners before, but never seen Africa as a visitor. It was as if this new vision opened up for me - an Africa I had never seen and a Kenya that existed in a way I never knew was possible. I kept thinking to myself: this must be what life will be like in my next dream city. And it was in that moment that the absurd and magical occurred. As we climbed through the afternoon darkness up the last steep mile, I saw a group of riders come galloping into view, riders and horses I'd never seen before and even didn't recognise. And as they passed me I heard one of them say quietly: 'There are no mountains here.' And for a few moments I lost sight of the familiar landmarks - even of the country I'd left - and I knew Africa again.

The scene on the horizon did not go unnoticed by the other runners on the trip. After a small detour to a local bar which proved insufficient to quench my thirst for local beer I turned and saw a group of runners smiling and waving. One of them had a note in his hand, but"," Kenyan coach Isaac Cheruiyot was visiting Boston and invited me along to run with his runners. ""This will be my first time training with fellow runners in America!"" he gushed. 

On our trek up the ice-capped Mount Kenya, Isaac and I discuss my approach to the course. In the words of Isaac ""Richard, we would like you to think like a Kenyan"". 

He's right. When you are hiking on a glacier with a group of runners, there are two distinct types of terrain to navigate. First, you want to move swiftly and fluidly over compact snow-covered terrain. The first mile will be the most taxing, as you climb from sea level to 11,000 feet. Second, you'll want to maintain a smooth, lope-like pace over the open stretches. We'd been training with snow over the past month, but now was the perfect chance to test out Isaac's advice. As we set off, he explained how Kenyans run over ""soft snow"" to soften the landing and promote faster, more agile movement. ""This is like playing pickleball in the rain"", I whispered to my partner, Sasha. 

Halfway up the 6 mile ascent, our lope-like pace suddenly turned to a frantic jog. We stumbled over large rocks in the soft snow, and then Isaac pulled me to a halt. We scrambled around for a few minutes, unsure of our"," I travelled to Nanyuk to run with some of the best Kenyan runners in their home stadium. With their coach, Paul Tanui, they are preparing to defend their world championship.

The night before the race a blizzard hits the base of Mount Kenya. With the wind chill and deep snow we retreat to a nearby mountain refuge. There we are greeted by a warm fire and tea. The team is delighted that I joined them. My two previous visits had been a huge success but this time they had invited me to join them the day before the race as well. The team discuss the significance of my presence on the team: some call me their psychological safety-valve, others their enforcer or even their coach but I am not entirely sure what that means but I know I am going to be climbing Mount Kenya the next morning, that is enough to feel happy. The team leaves early the next morning. I'm up at 4.30 am: the temperature outside is -9 °C but inside the warmth of the hut -2 °C. I dress carefully and grab some last minute toilet-stuff. There is also the matter of a water bladder as the local water has notoriously low quality.

At five o'clock we head into town to register our team number and pay the necessary fees. I am one of seven runners including world-class champion Paul Tanui who are training in Kenya to defend their world championship this year. Our coach is one"," Two of the best Kenyan runners I know, Richard Nerurkar and Daniel Wiliemi, would join me for the week. The four of us drove in a Land Rover to our mountain training campsite. The steep and loose gravel road zigzags up the mountain through the crisp clear air. We talk of our training goals, the route we will take the next day. Richard will go two miles further on to the summit than I. Daniel's feet are tough from years of playing soccer and downhill skiing, but his heart isn't in it. I, on the other hand, am well trained and feel fresh enough to be on the summit at the end of the week. I've done my best to prepare for the trip. First, I've filled my room at the hostel with lightweight clothes, hiking boots and a pot of hot soup. Second, I've bought a digital compass from the local hardware shop, as the GPS on my old one has stopped working. And third, I've taken a week off work in order to train. When the car park at the top of the hill is full, we walk down the short hill to a small farm with a small field, and a cozy wooden cottage. My room is near the road, where the sounds of the world outside are clearly audible. It's quiet and bright in the cottage but cozy, with an open log fire, and a small couch by the window. I spread out my new down sleeping bag"," Three years ago on that same training trek from Nanyuk to Thika, a small town twenty miles east of the capital Nairobi, I had watched as four young Kenyans — all of whom were already World-Class athletes — had completed the gruelling ten-mile run to the top of Mount Kenya. 

It had been a proud moment for me and a proud moment for the young Kenyans — all now professionals — who had beaten me to the summit, but at that point it had been no more than an observation. It wasn't until today that I got to see these young runners compete in front of a paying crowd. The Kenyans look well-fitted for the elite athlete life, in terms of their physiques. They were fit and strong and it seemed obvious to me that they could train and race at the highest levels. 

My guide, a young Kenyan, explains that this is the most challenging portion of the 10,000m that one can run — a 10-mile slog up a towering peak, where the ground only gets higher and higher. They say the last few hundred feet above the tree line can be very rocky and with some of the steepest pitches. I ask them what percentage of the total 10,000m does this section comprise. ""About one quarter,"" the guide says. They say I don't need to worry about the run since I'm the one running the 10,000m, but they"

So, who is the owner of the Westerman and what does he do? Well. I am a freelance journalist. I write about boats and sailing generally. I am also a member of a very select group of people who own a ship of the line. When I was growing up my father was captain of HMS Westerman which, after being named after my great-great grandfather, was used in the Second World War for radar patrols. 

When I was fourteen the Admiralty rang me up and asked if I wanted to go to sea. I didn't want to go to sea. My father said that I must go. So I did. I was sent to  Royal Naval Academy Portsmouth and spent three months aboard HMS Westerman in 1953. From 1956 to 1962 I was on board HMS Ardent in the Arabian Gulf with the British Joint Services Seaplane Branch, one of the most prestigious independent units in the Fleet Air Arm. 

My latest ship has a pedigree going back a century. My own Westerman was designed by Cunliffe, the current Commodore of the Royal Yacht Squadron. The Westerman began life as a commercial tuna fishing boat built in Finland by Metso. She was to have been called the 'Triton' but I suggested 'The Westerman'. Astonishingly enough, Cunliffe and I had a similar thought as we designed our boat, he"," But he's not. He's just a very clever sailor with great taste who appreciates beautiful lines and simple lines. He likes to sail my craft by traditional methods using ancient tools, but that's not why he buys his boats. He likes to spend time on his boats; to think about them, to watch the waves break over them, to imagine what it would be like to live on board. He says it's because boats are such a big part of our cultural heritage that we should do everything we can to protect them. I agree but ask him what heritage he's trying to protect. 'The boats in this show,' he says, 'but also the boats of 100 years ago, the boats that sailed the world two hundred years ago, the boats that might have sailed the world two thousand years ago, and the boats that will sail the world in 2022 when I'm old and grey. We should stop being so techno-obsessed and look to the past, to the human experience on land and in the water. We should learn from the past and make the future good for everyone not just for a few elites.' We're going to sail my boat. She looks pretty old but she should go well. We start by standing on the bank and getting our positions. He's a strong sailor so getting into the boat will be straightforward. I get into the boat by the back ladder. She's made of old wood and seems heavy in the hand. We take off our"," She is a genuine classic: her lines and timbers are in perfect harmony. I know that because I have spent the best part of a year disassembling her and examining the technical details of the joinery and glue that created her timeless beauty. In fact, looking at her now, she might even seem a little frumpy, or dowdy, in her retro-1960s glory days. But she was designed with cutting edge technology and this is the 21st century. She is very comfortable to sail, she is easy to keep clean and in perfect condition and she costs me a pittance. I may even be able to sell her for a profit and use the money to indulge my other love-affair, boating. She is the culmination of my lifelong love affair with boats. My childhood holidays were spent sailing. My first car was a boat. My parents have always owned boats. And my children grew up alongside boats on our rivers. I first started designing boats when I was 8 years old and have been designing ever since. My late father, who died when I was 13, was a master boat-builder who taught me how to read plans. My mother, who died aged 52, was equally adept at cutting up timber and drawing up plans. And there was one important person in our household, my wife. I never felt hemmed in by what a boat needed. My wife knew what was most important: the space on the boat for ourselves and"," But actually she is just your typical British boat of her time - solid, practical and of good craft. She's had a few upgrades (more solar panels, larger generator) but she is still a traditional boat of her kind and, I hope, of my dreams. I bought her from a yard near Cambridge which had her hull in their traditional white. That's a job for a modern yard who will know to treat it with chemicals which are safe for the wood but will give the old hull a bright new coat. Back to my craft - this is a well-proportioned 50 feet of solid British design built to the old style of planking, strakes and diagonal braces. She has been painted in a traditional blue which gives a welcome shade of old alongside new modern technology. She is, in my humble view, a work of art and the embodiment of my dreams. She is both beautiful and functional and to see her move on the tidal creek is a joy which is all the more poignant because it is so unusual. She may not be a work of modern design, but for sheer beauty and grace and practicality her days are numbered. As a good ship I am going to let go and she will disappear into the tide. And that is why all new technology should be combined with old traditional building methods. For she is an ancient craft and the purest expression of old dreams. Tom Cunliffe is the author of 'Utopian Dreams' and a boat"," She is a joy to behold. The ribs are beautifully crafted. The planking is immaculate. Everything about her screams timeless elegance. And yet. and yet. I bought her. I have no idea why. Perhaps she reminded me of the old family boat that I grew up on. Perhaps I sensed a nostalgia in her and was looking for a pastiche. Who knows. She has been named 'Diana'. And she is an absolute joy to sail. It has taken me a while to warm to her but now I really like her. I'm not sure why. I suspect the answer is in the name. Diana is beautiful but she is a boat of myths and memories. She combines elements of many boats that I have loved over the years. She reminds me of the classic American yachts of the 70's with their sharp outlines and sleek lines. Like them she has a large, well shaped hull. She reminds me of a French 40's yachtsman with its simple lines and open cockpit. But she is also modern with a highly efficient engine and electronic controls. And she is fun too. This is why she is my dream boat. It fits all the criteria that Tom laid down. Old with new. Classic with contemporary. She is a work of art. But she is also a vessel of my heart and for those reasons she has been the subject of this article. I believe that Diana is a lovely boat. But she is hardly unique. She is"," Her timbers are carefully hand planed to reveal the wood's signature grain, knots and knots of pitch-pine run up the masts, a testament to her construction 25 years ago. There's not much modern technology in her; she runs on sails and a pair of electric motors that have seen better days. But this is no sad relic of the past; it's a beautiful boat that's easy to sail and fast enough to cut through the choppy waters of the south coast sea-lanes, where I catch my fish. She's also surprisingly cheap to maintain: all the labour is done by hand and the upkeep is minimal. Despite her humble origins she is the best boat ever built. She's a winner. She's a design classic. She's a winner. She's a design classic. She's a winner. She's a design classic. She's a winner. She's a design classic. She's a winner. She's a design classic. She's a winner.

However my boat has become a reality thanks to the combined wisdom of digital design and old-school sail making.  She reflects both new and old but it is the old that is most striking. Her lines are pure Edwardian with all the rigging, masts and sails still intact. The interior is Edwardian with its soft leather seats and brass fittings. The engines are vintage  and have enough juice to get us down the river.  Her decks and interior are decorated with period artefacts and art from my travels and she is just as comfortable in the water as on land. 

My boat is the culmination of a hobby I have had for 30 years.  I design and build boats.  And it was this hobby that was the starting point of my voyage of discovery through digital design, old and new.  But the journey has been full of challenges as I stumbled upon the wisdom of sailing. Sailing taught me a lot about how materials behave in extreme conditions and in my quest to create a boat that was light, fast and powerful I was surprised to discover how old-school some things are.  To find out more about how to sail I visited a small boat in Portugal and found my way to an informal course on the Thames in London.  I learnt a lot about boat building and just how important it is to plan every inch of the boat,  especially the interior. And the result has been a boat which will take me where my dreams"

From the above sentence and your comments below:

The hedgehog is native to Australia, but also distributes in many other parts of the world.
Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines, thus are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker using their ball rolling ability as a last resort.

"," 

In Australia most hedgehogs are found in the east in the cooler months of the year. Most hedgehogs do not live in the heat of the day and instead live under cover during the day. A number of Australian state emblems includes the koala as it is one of the three species that are considered the most at risk from extinction. The other two species are the Northern Rainbow Bear and the Southern Rainbow Bear. 

Hedgehog A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked so that their spines point outwards. The effectiveness of this as a defence mechanism depends of course on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight and consequently they have fewer spines and are thus more likely to attempt to run into their attacker using their ball rolling ability as a last resort.

 The Hedgehog state emblem of the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory was approved in 2000.  Since then, there has been significant recovery of some species but the outlook for the rest is uncertain.

We then show"," The Australian Desert Hedgehog is one of the most poisonous mammals and will attempt to eat anything including humans. The Australian Desert Hedgehog is not a predator as its slow pace of movement makes it easy to catch. The Australian desert hedgehog is sometimes used as an anti-snoring device.


Hedgehog B is correct because while the spines of the Australian Desert Hedgehog may be effective as a defence mechanism it is, in fact, more likely to cause you to be eaten as it is a venomous creature.


Hedgehog C is incorrect because although the spines of the Australian Desert Hedgehog are potentially lethal to humans, it does not attempt to eat humans as a regular course of action.


Hedgehog D is incorrect because although the Australian Desert Hedgehog does not attack humans it has the ability to roll into a tight ball in order to defend itself, something that some desert hedgehogs have evolved to do.


Hedgehog E is incorrect because although the Australian Desert Hedgehog is not a predator it is actually quite slow moving. As a consequence, it is easy to catch. Furthermore, the fact that the Australian Desert Hedgehog will eat anything makes it both less dangerous and, in fact, an easy target.


Hedgehog F is incorrect because although the Australian Desert Hedgehog is not a predator its slow pace of movement means that it is easy to catch.

There are three different types of hedgehog which includes the European hedgehog, Chinese hedgehog and the African hedgehog.


The European hedgehog is characterised by a combination of soft fur and a long body. It has the smallest number of spines of all hedgehog species. Some scientists believe this is due to the European hedgehog’s habitat. European hedgehogs live in forests in Eastern Europe, Great Britain and Western Siberia.


The Chinese hedgehog is a larger species. It is furry and has long legs with large paws. This gives it the strength to fight back using its powerful legs and teeth to rake away at its attackers. Some studies have shown that Chinese hedgehog species actually use their legs to protect their spines. They feel threatened and instinctively curl their legs up around their body.


The African hedgehog has the largest number of spines. In fact, the African hedgehog is the only species of hedgehog that has a poisonous spine which causes a severe reaction in humans if a puncture occurs. These spines are extremely sharp and highly poisonous to humans.


Hedgehog attacks 
Unlike most other small mammals, hedgehog attacks are not aggressive. They are defensive in nature and when attacked they roll into a ball in order to use their sharp spines to prevent the attacker from getting close enough to them to suffer a bite.


The number of spines a hedgehog has determines how effective its ball rolling defence mechanism"

The Industrial Revolution, however, provided smiths with a new market and the result was a proliferation of blacksmiths’ shops in towns and cities across the country. It was now that they found their former stature was fully restored. Ironmongers’ and fairs’ vendors, too, benefited from this. Their wares were much easier to pack away in a suitcase when compared to those of a metalworker and could therefore be offered at exorbitant prices to consumers who never even saw the smith’s shop or the smith himself. Blacksmiths were therefore encouraged to focus on their artisitic skills and to ignore the industrial world entirely, where their products were used to destroy lives and destroy cities.

For instance, blacksmiths would now make their customers a helmet that was a death trap and then ensure their customers actually tried to wear the helmet by asking them to enter the abyss of their own minds. And thus the blacksmith’s art became divorced from the reality in which we lived and, in so doing, became de-historicised in a way that suited the demands of fashion designers, architects, interior decorators and other fashionable tastemakers who had ushered in what has become known as “post-historical” culture.

In time, perhaps inevitably, blacksmiths began to look and behave in ways that were entirely non-historical, no longer honed by their craft into a fine metalworking artisitic","

However, just as there had been a resurgence in interest in the 17th Century in the medical arts, there has been a revival of interest among 20th-century architects in the use of traditional blacksmith techniques. Now there are several manufacturers of re-enamelled and hand-forged wrought-iron items and a number of schools devoted to this tradition of artisinal ironwork, including several in the south of England whose blacksmith alumni have designed such prestigious structures as the M32 and Royal Mint Building in London.


This revival of interest is largely due to the fact that most large structures now comprise of many thousands of pounds of wrought iron. And so ironworkers once again enjoy the respect and the status which had once been theirs.


As well as being an artisinal practitioner, a blacksmith also needs to have a working knowledge of all the materials required, a sledge hammer, a vise, a forge, a smelting furnace and a forging kiln. He needs to understand what shape the part will take and will often forge several versions of the part before the one which meets all the requirements is finished. He is also an operator of a large variety of heavy and small tools including: the grapple, the chisel, the drill, the punch, the hammer, the stirrup, the wedge and the gouge. He also needs to understand the metalworking art of riveting.

If","

Then came the Age of Steel. Highly mechanised metal working means a blacksmith no longer needs to hand-hammer each piece, but instead uses a variety of tools to guide a giant pneumatic ram and large hydraulic press. A modern day master craftsman such as James Watt would be hard-pressed to produce anything near the complex shapes, the intricacy and the quality of the work now possible by a small team of dedicated blacksmiths based within easy reach of the huge factory furnaces.

The Smiths of Tooley Street, Coventry have adopted the new techniques and have embraced the digital age to the extent that they now use robotics to perform many of the more exacting tasks they had employed human muscle to perform a generation ago. They have retained their traditional craftsmanship by the application of a modern approach, whilst still respecting the metal’s innate beauty and utilising it to complement their contemporary interior design, rather than standing as an uninviting intrusion in the architectural scheme.

Smithing has long been recognised as a branch of architecture, so much so that blacksmiths often appear alongside stonemasons and carpenters on a building site. The ancient Greeks employed blacksmiths alongside their architect fathers, believing that a well made metal piece of work could outshine the best stone building.

The ancient Romans placed statues of the gods of metal on their temples. Later, during the Italian Renaissance, blacksmiths became the"," In 1970 an immigrant blacksmith by the name of Vardinoyannis arrived in Britain. He had been living and working in the Middle East but his country was then being bombed out and he and his family fled for their lives. He arrived penniless and was forced to start life again as an immigrant. By the time he was forty he was running a successful business and he began to train apprentices. His passion for the craft and his belief in its future inspired his workforce and in the early 1990s a wave of young blacksmiths were trained through the medium of Channel 4 television. By 2000 Vardinoyannis’s son had succeeded him as the company’s chief executive. It has since grown to become the biggest manufacturer of forged and polished metal in Britain and it employs 3,000 people. Many of its best workers are first generation immigrants. But the success of Vardinoyannis’s company is not solely based on ethnic roots but on the strength of its products and its promise for the future. One of its most popular designs is for a two-wheel cycle that allows the rider to pedal while straddling the back of the bike. This allows urban mobility for those who are short enough to be satisfied with standing on the seat. 

While Vardinoyannis’s firm has prospered, other traditional blacksmiths have been affected. In the United States, a few have been forced to close down due to competition"," However, as a result of a combination of government subsidy and entrepreneurship, blacksmiths re-emerged from the closet. There is now widespread demand for blacksmiths to make bespoke swords, medieval armour and other weapons.


The author of this article has been a smith for twenty years and believes that the re-emergence of blacksmithing in Britain has been beneficial. He argues that blacksmiths, because of the lack of reliance on technology for weapons and farm machinery, have had the space and time to develop a profound understanding of human psychology and to come to understand the subtle nuances of language. He further believes that blacksmiths have a unique ability to tell good sword from bad, and that they can analyse a sword blade and be able to describe what makes it work.

The author is the"," The last blacksmith was John Stretch.  

Stretch worked in the local village blacksmith’s for three decades. As he explains in this passage, the work had become increasingly mechanised, with most steel being produced now by the giant German companies known as ‘Migs’. 

But Stretch remained unsatisfied.  

“What if we could still make something beautiful and functional?” he mused. “What if I could still be a provider of good, solid metalwork for the world?”  

It was his wife, Margaret, who encouraged him to start researching the process of forging metal.  

In 1970, Stretch returned to school. He had never attended formal learning, having spent his teenage years designing computer programs. He started studying at the University of Brighton in the South of England, where he gained his PhD in metallurgy and forged his own path.  

It was only later, through the power of the internet, that he was able to share the discovery with the general public. And it was his discoveries which ultimately led to him winning this year’s Redgrave Medal.  

There are two remarkable elements to his story. The first is that, having only returned to formal learning late in life, he managed to complete his PhD thesis and publish his work at the relatively advanced age of 60. The second is that, having spent his teenage years designing computer programs, he was able to design and build"," It was only with the development of the environmental movement, urban regeneration and “creative destruction” that the art of the blacksmith was rediscovered by new urban managers and planners who were keen to reclaim industrial sites.

Blacksmiths, who had traditionally worked alongside industrial machinery, now emerged as prominent figures in the urban environment. They are now a familiar sight along the perimeter of major sites like airports, power stations and housing schemes. While most practitioners are keen to stress that the role is not political, the emergence of the blacksmith into public spaces was in part a response to neglect following the demise of the industry, as well as a deliberate attempt to reclaim symbolism that was once integral to the industrial landscape.

While many of the blacksmiths working with the newly invigorated urban environment are keen to stress that they are not political, the role is being developed in the shadow of the contemporary artisan as a modern artisans reclaiming a craft that once employed large numbers of workers and was intimately associated with the industrial environment.


The artisans of the 21st century are utilising traditional skills that had declined in popularity, while at the same time incorporating new methods such as digital fabrication. Whereas in the past they might have spent weeks working with traditional tools, they now use 3D printers capable of creating products much faster. Furthermore, blacksmiths are utilising the internet to share information and collaborate with others across the world in order to increase"

At first it was only the outside of the new Museum of Scotland that was unmissable stuck on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh with its huge yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings topped by a hulk of a hanging garden. Last winter the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece''stunning') cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. There were questions about whether it would attract a significant audience, whether it would stand up to inspection, and a general lack of confidence in the competence or sincerity of those responsible for it. Even many visitors admitted that it looked very slick but were confused by its lack of information or its apparent purpose. It didn't look like a museum at all. At least I thought that was the criticism. I decided to go and find out. Entering the building, the first thing that struck you was how very bright and very white the interior was. The lighting was excellent and the information display was clear and engaging. It was a big space and the curving walls made it feel less confined. The museum's opening exhibition, The Cheese Wizards, was a real coup. Exhibition curator, Lisa McPherson, designed the exhibition to tell the story of the cheese wedge and the story of early 19th century food and drink innovation, through the eyes of the famous cheesemonger, George Duncanson. This exhibition won the National Museum of Food and Drink's food and drink innovation award for 2015. The curator, Lisa McPherson, and McPherson's assistants, Jennifer Fenton and Helen Campbell, spent months researching and preparing the exhibition, developing original objects and exploring the museum's archives to tell this fascinating story. It was fascinating and inspiring. It showed the potential power of food, both to define social classes and to create and define regions and","Simplify the following narrative for Grade 2 learners in the Flesch Kincaid Grade scale:

Last winter the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece''stunning') cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. I remember thinking the criticism was a bit much. My own personal feelings were mixed. The designers' ambition to create a dramatic modern structure had obviously been realised and the critics were probably right to criticise it. At the same time, the outside of the building is a striking symbol of the ambitions of the Scottish nation to do things differently and is certainly impressive in the extreme. Inside things could not be more different. With its mixture of permanent displays of rare artefacts, temporary art exhibitions and vibrant community space it has a more settled vibe and feels less like a'stunner'. The entrance hall is full of a kind of postmodern kitsch, a collection of shiny, angular metal and ceramic objects that are certainly arresting and impressive. But the objects don't look like anything of a human make and, more importantly, they look like they came from outer space. They could have come from any one of the planets of the solar system. There are, indeed, many similarities between the design of the museum and that of another famous space-age building in Houston, Texas, the Museum of Science, designed by the late Philip Johnson. The objects at the Tartan Museum can be understood as exemplifying the principles of the 'New Structuralism' proposed by the French philosopher, André Comte-Sponville, that states that any modern, technological or scientific idea or object should be regarded as part of a structural whole in which all its parts have a specific and autonomous function.

Last winter the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece''stunning') cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. 'Look! Cheesedumb!' 'Epic fail.' This was not a pleasant experience. It was a very modern building. The outside was bold and striking, bold and striking against the old Edinburgh buildings. But as soon as you stepped inside - the interior - it wasn't so striking. The spaces were too uniform, too cold, too soulless - you could have been at any of the other new buildings being constructed at the time. There is nothing wrong with the building itself. In fact the outside is beautiful - the colour, the boldness, the sense of air and sunlight - so why did I hate it? I hate all new buildings. Especially if they look a lot like old buildings they replace. There was no cheese in the museum of scotland. It wasn't my favourite museum, but it was a museum.

'Whoever designed it should be strung up,' wrote one critic, 'for being ignorant, incompetent and showing utter disregard for historic Edinburgh.'. For the public the opening of the new building brought a mixture of joy and disappointment, and though 'there was a smattering of applause', there was also the admission that 'this museum... has done very little to advance the cause of cheese-wedge architecture'. Indeed, the architect was not invited to the official opening, but instead had to wait until half an hour afterwards before his name was read out. At least the museum does have some wonderful contemporary art on show, which some visitors appreciate, but its 'exceptional artwork' director feels that its shortcomings include 'too many high-tech displays that take attention away from the art'. However, some visitors do seem to think that the architecture of the museum is good, and indeed a recent visit I had was a memorable one with great views of the magnificent architecture (including views of the nearby Castle Rock).  

The Tartan Museum is an impressive new museum in Edinburgh, and has good architecture. Its contemporary art is good, and there is some good art in it. However, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade 2 scale would probably class it as 'difficult' to read.

Last winter the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece''stunning') cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. But, with the benefit of hindsight (sorry Sally), the reception may have been unfavourable because the new Museum of Scotland did have one particular feature that had many critics railing against it - an open cheese-wedge. Many Scots were shocked. 'What kind of museum is this?' complained one member of the public. 'Is it suitable for the city? There's no place for it in our skyline'. To which the museum's director, Stewart McDonald, responded 'it's actually a very suitable and prominent location'... ...and 'it does complement the Edinburgh skyline'. In this telling the story we can see the cheese-wedge as part of a modernist scheme designed to complement the skyline rather than a monstrosity standing out in a neighbourhood of Victorian skyscrapers. The cheese-wedge serves a useful architectural purpose and has a good reputation, but the narrative is more a case of architecture complementing the skyline rather than the building being designed to take prominence in the skyline. The narrative also exemplifies the use of explicit information and limited number of information points: the explicit information is Sally Varlow's visit to the Museum of Scotland, and the information points are Chambers Street in Edinburgh, the 'hanging garden' and 'no place for it in our skyline'.

As part of a broader programme to learn more about Sir Edmund Halley's voyages, the British Geological Survey today sends a team of volunteers to sea in a replica of the vessel he sailed on, and from where they aim to observe the behaviour of the compass. 

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous scientist, an astronomer and a member of the Royal Society. He made three trips on the warship Paramore from England to the West Indies in the years 1682-3, 1684-5 and 1686-7.  He was also an astronomer to the court of King James II and Charles II. The British Geological Survey is the only organization in the UK to have a dedicated team of volunteers who aim to observe the behaviour of the compass on board the vessel, in this way making Sir Edmund Halley's voyages and the work he did at that time available to science in the 21st century. 

The British Geological Survey is a charity dedicated to understanding the earth and its processes. We aim to support science and innovation in the earth and geosciences sector. For more information, please visit www.bgs.ac.uk. 

The Paramore is a purpose-built replica of the warship Sir Edmund Halley used on his voyages. It was launched in 2016 and has an aim to support and inspire young people to consider careers in the earth and geosciences sector through education, outreach"," The 'compass' Sir Halley refers to here is the magnetic compass. In 1676, as part of his attempt to observe the sun across 3 full moon periods, Halley set out from Greenwich. To take readings along the way he needed a fixed point. At this time Greenwich was in the position of having 2 known magnetic poles with one in the Atlantic and one in the Pacific. To get around the problem of having 2 fixed points, Sir Halley decided to set up a large magnet in the garden of his home in Henley-on-Thames - now known as the Sir Edmund Halley Magnet Gardens. Sir Halley chose his site for the magnet garden based on the position of his then current 'fixed point' in the Atlantic - a magnet in a garden in Germany had a fixed position in the North Sea. Once Sir Halley arrived in France he changed his mind and returned home. However once back at home his initial fix proved inadequate so he decided to set off again for the North Sea the next day (Monday 21st June 1676).

The first magnetic compass was made by Sir Isaac Newton in 1668. Sir Edmund Halley's quest for an alternative to the 'warship compass' was inspired by Sir Isaac Newton's work on an alternative to the use of the ship's compass. The quest is known as 'the true north project'. Dr Toby Clark a British Geological Survey Researcher is leading a group that is chart"," This discovery would have significant impact on navigation and exploration that continues to this day. The story of Sir Edmund Halley's quest to obtain a copy of Sir Isaac Newton's (1643-1727) book 'Motorium magnum' is now the stuff of legend.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) was born in London to a family with strong naval connections and, after a childhood spent at sea, he chose to pursue medicine. This however was to be the break that changed his life and career. Halley joined the British Geological Survey in 1684. The Survey was established by Royal Charter to carry out scientific research and provide geological information for the Navy and Crown. While serving in the Netherlands in 1687 Sir Edmund Halley made a very significant observation that would prove very useful for mapping the earth. He noted that, although the magnetic compass was true north the 'declination' was not equal to the angle between the magnetic and true north but was instead greater than 90 degrees. This observation was key in allowing the survey to undertake accurate mapping of continental Europe. The importance of Sir Edmund Halley's research cannot be underestimated and was instrumental in laying the foundation of modern navigation.

At the age of 50 Sir Edmund Halley embarked on a circumnavigation of the globe on the 36-foot-long ship 'Paramore' armed with state of the art navigational instruments that included magnetic compasses and a hygro-therm"," 

Dr Toby Clark, a British Geological Survey Researcher and one of Halley's foremost biographers is now looking for a way to retrace his footsteps to chart the compass variations and make a name for himself. A plan forms in his mind and with the help of a research assistant, he undertakes a two year journey along the east coast of the Americas - starting in Massachusetts. Their goal will be to reach the Galapagos Islands after sailing round South America. Here, Clark and his team hope to hire the services of a Native American shaman - Pinta - to use his magical powers to provide guidance. And after a few weeks on land they set off for a crossing of the Pacific to a settlement in Tahiti. 

Their journey takes them through the North Atlantic crossing the Arctic Circle and around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, the start of the journey to the East Coast of the Americas. On this last leg of the journey the Paramore encountered strong headwinds and took five weeks to cover. Dr Clark and his assistant decide that this is the time for a diversion to chart some of the compass variations, hoping to find a variation in their favour. 

The story of their attempt becomes the first chapter of Clark's forthcoming book 'True North - The Man behind the Comet' to be published in 2021 by Profile Books. 

In the story a few days before Christmas 1736 the two men hired a sledge to","

On 2 February 2020, Sir Edmund Halley's Voyage of March, 1671 is re-published after having lain unpublished for 200 years. It provides details of the voyages made by Sir Edmund Halley to map the variations of the compass. The voyage takes the astronomer from Plymouth to the Cape of Good Hope and back via the island of Jan Mayen, passing through the Atlantic, the Indian, and the Pacific Oceans. It concludes with Sir Edmund Halley and his crew encountering strong westerly winds and frequent squalls and rain while travelling from the Cape to the River Thames.

The voyage begins with a discussion of Sir Edmund Halley's 'observation of the declination of the compass at various places'. Sir Edmund Halley's experience on the warship Paramore is brought up again where he states:

It seems impossible to have performed the observations intended in the present voyage, without the use of the compass, as my directions were few and brief; but by this means we were enabled to find our way in those rough seas, and to guide the boats during those periods when we had lost sight of our companions.

Sir Edmund Halley goes on to state that the crew did not find their way to 'certain Islands, supposed to be situated in lat. 52 degrees S, and that the weather became so thick and rainy that they had to seek shelter on a Coast of Greenland.' This is the location of Fr"," 

Sir Edmund travels to Greenland in the 1720s and on this return voyage makes a remarkable observation. He says: ""when we drew near the pole, we observed no alteration in the course of the compass; which, though we expected from the heat of the atmosphere there, was unexpected"" (Halley 1738, vol. 1, p. 37). In other words, Sir Edmund did not observe any change in the needle's magnetic orientation, and was shocked by this.

To Sir Edmund's surprise there is no scientific explanation for this. In the absence of a scientific explanation and given his extensive voyage records, Sir Edmund, or more correctly Toby Clark, the scientist behind the Paramore, writes an article for the Brit Med J, 'On the Variations of the Compass: In the Arctic Regions. Observations of Sir Edmund Halley'. Toby Clark concludes that a vapour, most likely from seething whales, is causing this deviation.

Sir Edmund returns to England and publishes his observations in The Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1733, where his article is published in Volume 4. Clark continues his research, studying the effects of atmospheric vapour on the compass. In the process, he discovers the composition of the vapour causing the compass deviation. This discovery has significant consequences, both scientifically and practically. Sir Edmund Halley's ship can now visit the North and South Pole. The compass deviation and temperature change can be used","  

The explorer will use calculations, made by him on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore, that show the variation of the compass. The explorer says that he uses these calculations in his research. He explains that the variations could be explained with a varying magnetic field around the globe.

" My strategy going up Everest is to ascend by steps, one foot for every hundred meters, until I hit the snow cave. We had done the cave first, on the way down. I started to feel weird, the sensation of blood leaving my body, so I don’t now how much blood left my body but a while later, while I was sitting down, I felt myself stand up. I turned to look at Dougal and I saw what I later thought was a bright white light, I could not tell whether it was on the ceiling or directly in front of me, but I saw it and then I fainted. B. Mt. Everest (8586m) On 14 May, 2011, I reached the summit of Mt. Everest at 02:00 AM, 20 years to the day after my birth. I climbed with three friends, who are all better qualified than I am for such an adventure. We reached the summit via the Western Traverse Route and the Northeast Ridge Route. Both of these are considered the most dangerous routes up Mt. Everest. In all my 44 years, I had only previously summited five other mountains, which included: Carstensz Pyramid, Mt. Elbrus, Shisha Pangutina, Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya. To reach the summit of Mt. Everest requires a mixture of skill, luck, and endurance, but to do so successfully you also need to"," I was alone in a dark chamber with nothing to hold on to. Then the slope started to ease and I felt my way along the wall. I could see Dougal now, he was looking down at me. We both laughed, then I found my way to Dougal. I didn't say anything, but the tears were running down my cheeks. I felt at home, I felt safe. After eight hours of darkness and vertigo, Dougal and I reached the summit and spent two hours clambering back down the slope to the South Summit. Dougal turned to me and said ""that was fun, wasn't it"", and he turned back to his ice ax. He was gone. I sat in the snow, I felt lost. Then the slope steepened. The temperature plummeted. The air smelled of sulphur. I climbed with my head down, moving as quickly and efficiently as possible, one hand on the fixed ropes, the other on the Ice Ax. I was alone, or so I thought, until I looked up to find a climber looking down at me. We spoke for a while, and then he began to descend. I followed. As he approached me I realised he was carrying a heavy load. This is where it started to rain, and it rained on me. Dougal was right, it had been fun, hadn't it. We both laughed. Then I turned back to the summit to begin my descent. I was alone."," My brain had turned into a pretzel and so in my disembodied state I discussed the merits of various sleeping bags with my feet. I found that this was not as strange as I had thought it to be, and I then asked my feet why we could not use the spaceheat bag Dougal had packed.  My feet explained it to me; we would burn all our oxygen the higher we went so the spaceheat bag was a must.  So, there you go, we climbed 8986m and slept in the spaceheat bag.  A. Mount Elbrus Europe (6782m) The climb up to the South Summit on Elbrus was a series of three pitches of steep ice that required two fixed ropes. Our Plan was to ascend the ""North Face"" via the top ropes and rappel the ""South Face"".  The first two pitches had impressive icefall sequences that we avoided with clever climbing and rope management.  After a brief rest period we continued our climb to the ""North Summit"".  The North Summit had fixed lines that we tied into to allow for a summit assault.  The North Summit had a substantial portion of the ""South Face"" on the right and a large cornice on the left. We found the ""North Face"" approach easier and climbed to the top rope, tied into the fixed lines that would take us the remaining four pitches to the ""South Summit"".  While the fixed lines moved us quickly we found ourselves"," It took the combined efforts of Dougal, Dave and myself the next night to get Dougal back into the cave. The following morning we woke up to another amazing view; I knew I had to do this. I wrote my name on a flat rock on the mountain with a toothpick. While the others descended, I spent three weeks trying to reach the summit. I was too lazy to carry a stove so ate only one meal a day. I felt the oxygen get thinner the higher I climbed. The cold became more intense. The higher I got the more I had to take off my boots. I spent two nights on a small platform in the ice with a single down sleeping bag, the wind blowing against my face waking me up at 3am when it got cold enough. Despite suffering a frostbite injury to my left hand, I continued to climb. I reached the summit at 29 years old. I could not believe I had done this. We had a bottle of champagne waiting for me but I was too cold to celebrate; I just wanted to get down the mountain and go home. Returning to base camp and seeing the photos from the summit had a profound effect on me; I realised that my life now consisted of summitting Mt. Everest and returning home. A. Mount Kilimanjaro Africa (HD aerial shot) We started our ascent with a full day's food and warm boots. We had a GPS to guide us but it also got confusing."," I asked if I could borrow his sleeping bag when we returned down hill. B. Mount Elbrus Europe (9064m) My friend and climbing partner Dougal and I had set off from Kathmandu in a bid to climb Mount Everest. We had to wait for an expedition that would return with a team of Sherpa who had summited Mount Everest before we could begin our bid for Elbrus. We spent four months training in Nepal, then with our gear and training took six weeks on the mountain. While we waited for a helicopter to bring us down from our camp at 21,000 feet we spent time with friends in the Khumbu Icefall. On the way down the icefall we were hit by a snowstorm and our four man team lost three members. When we finally arrived at base camp we were disappointed to find only one of our four expedition permits had been renewed. We were in the process of trying to reapply when we were called upon to rescue an elderly Sherpa who had suffered a heart attack while climbing up the Icefall. After a month of convalescence our permits were finally granted and we returned to the Khumbu to spend another month training and prepare for the expedition to the summit of Mount Everest. C. Mount Kirishima Japenese (2664m) I wanted to climb Mt. Everest but not at such an early age, so I went to Nepal where I was able to train for months"," We had been discussing the merits of the Oxygen-X and Ultralight sleeping bags. I am ashamed to say that my concentration was now firmly on my feet and I was saying to myself, “My feet look like sausages”. At this point I remember being vaguely aware that we were still below the summit but my thoughts were entirely on my feet. I then became aware that we had been talking to a man with a microphone. We had been discussing the merits of the Oxygen-X and Ultralight sleeping bags. We discussed how the Ultralight sleeping bag seemed to do a good job in keeping us sufficiently warm but was rather heavy. We then discussed that the Oxygen-X seemed to be doing an effective job of providing enough oxygen, light, and space in our shelter whilst also being light enough to not be a burden. We then discussed how both sleeping bags looked rather like sausages and my attention now firmly on my feet. We then made our way back up the mountain in the cold and dark to the Snow cave. I remember feeling slightly queasy but that was due to my lack of acclimatisation to the altitude. I felt reasonably well prepared for what lay ahead. We then summited in a new record for both our team and for British men. B. Mount Everest (8547m) The summit of Mount Everest was bittersweet. We had achieved our ambition of climbing all seven summits. To accomplish this we had"," (A fun memory and a good reason to keep climbing) 

The Seven Summits are, from highest to lowest, Mount Everest,Mount Elbrus, Mount Denali, K2, Kangchenjunga, Mont Blanc (the highest peak in the European Alps), Aconcagua (the highest peak in the Southern Hemisphere)


To reach this level, texts should use simple sentence patterns with memorised phrases, use explicit information, use information in a limited number of information points and use explicit information in a limited number of information points.

Text should avoid phrases like 'I thought this was strange', 'putting this down to oxygen deprivation', or 'I found myself talking to my feet'. Such phrases don't contain any explicit information which makes them harder to process. Similarly, sentences like 'I talked to my feet' contain multiple pieces of information which require the reader to parse them out.

The Seven Summits are, from highest to lowest, Mount Everest,Mount Elbrus, Mount Denali, K2, Kangchenjunga, Mont Blanc (the highest peak in the European Alps), Aconcagua (the highest peak in the Southern Hemisphere)


The following books provide details of the Seven Summits:

" Consider if the group might want to be in motion. If they do then try to use slow shutter speeds so as to blur out the movement. And try to avoid cameras with wide lenses which often gives a “group portrait” look. B. SELECTIVE CROSS-FRONTS SHOT If possible have at least two groups in one photograph. One group near you (ie. front row) and one group at a distance (ie. the back row). It is even better if you can include a group near you and a group at a distance. And if you can include faces in both rows. You are looking for something between a “group of friends” and a “social group portrait”. In any case the subjects should be aware of your presence so that they do not move about and disturb the photograph. Also avoid including anyone who is known to be a close personal friend of yours (ie. spouse, children, friends from school etc.) or whose presence you have explicitly asked for in the instructions. And try to include people you don’t know very well (ie. colleagues, acquaintances from a social event, strangers you have seen on the street etc.). And be extremely careful when you include children: your photographer father has instilled in me that photographing children without their parent’s permission is a grave crime. And I strongly urge you to exercise extreme caution when photographing children and ensure that the child is safe and does not move about before, during and after the photograph"," B. PHOTOSPHING PEOPLE Keep your eye and lens on the subject you are trying to photograph. Avoid moving your eyes and searching for the best angle. C. TAKING THE PHOTOGRAPH Try to set the camera on a tripod, if possible with a neutral viewing angle. If you are using a smartphone try to use a neutral skin color if possible, as the skin will appear white in the image. Also try using a neutral background if you can, or at the least one that does not interfere with the subject in front of the camera.

A. GROUPING PEOPLE

Group shots are very important. People will look at the group much more than they do individual portraits. However as groups are typically more relaxed people should not be too closely grouped. Avoid grouping people when standing in a line as it may look too strict and unnatural. Instead, have someone leading the group so that the person in front of the camera has some sense of direction. In addition, you can include in the group elements that are at a distance such as a tree or a building. This will break the line in the picture without distracting from the picture.

B. PHOTOSPHING PEOPLE

As a general rule avoid taking a close up of anyone's face as it will make them look tense and angry. If you must take a close up avoid looking at the subjects eyes since that will make the subject look away from the camera. Instead focus on the"," B. MAINTAINING THE PHOTOGRAPH Have the camera on ""A"" or ""S"" setting (depending on the size of the sensors) and the shutter speed long enough to allow for blurring of faces. Use a wide angle lens and/or low ISO to reduce graininess and noise. Remember that the flash will cause a harsh picture and always use a reflector to soften the flashlight. If the people are in motion do not attempt to freeze the action. Use a cable release and a remote release to avoid camera movement. C. SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE LENS Select the lens for the job. Remember that the focal length of the lens defines the depth of field. A longer lens will provide a shallow depth of field which will allow you to take close up portraits but lose background. A shorter lens will provide a shallower depth of field which will make it easier to photograph people in front of a bright background but portraits will be blurry. When choosing a lens to match the subject (depth of field) also remember that the camera's focal length will match the focal length of the lens so a 50mm lens on a camera with a 35mm lens mount will provide the same field of view as a 50mm lens on a 450mm telephoto lens. If the subject is a landscape look for a wide angle lens with a wide angle perspective (i.e. 10 to 40mm) which will provide a shallow depth of field and a wide"," B. GETTING THE RIGHT SHOT Take your time taking the shot. Look for a moment when everyone is involved and look for a compelling composition. Remember that a badly composed shot can be worse than no shot. It is also important to remember that people vary in terms of clothing, make-up, hair style and other attributes so you need to find a way to capture this. C. CLEANLINESS OF SHOT Ensure that all subjects in the frame are in focus and in the same shot. Ensure that none of the subjects are in the way of the others or blocking any of the important features of the face. D. STYLING Consider how you are going to use the image. Do you want to use the image to tell a story about the subject or the photographer? If so try to find a way to use the group shot to show the subjects of the group in a flattering way and also the photographer in an flattering way. E. PHOTO EDIT Use sharp and focused lenses. Ensure that the focus is sharp across the image. Avoid shaking, jiggling or any movement which might affect sharpness across the image. Also keep the shutter speed short so that the image is not blurred. F. POST-PROCESSING Consider enhancing the image. Apply some of the basic photographic enhancement techniques. Borders, red-eye removal and black and white conversion can be helpful here. G. PREVIOUS SUBMISSIONS Submit your image"," Make sure that the people on the right and left have similar clothing and position their hands, faces and eyes on the same level. B. TAKING PHOTOS PLUS STITCHING PHOTOS Even though it might not be possible in all cases avoid the following pitfalls. 1. Taking photos while the people are moving Avoid taking photos while the people are moving. Some cameras have a continuous auto-focus that will try to detect the subject and the motion will cause the picture to blur. 2. Blurry photos Use a neutral background. Avoid shooting people from above or below. 3. Taking photos too close up Avoid taking photos too close up. Some people have a lot of hair and if the photos are too close the hair can get in the frame. 4. Taking photos in low light situations Use a tripod. 5. Not using manual settings Some cameras have a function for manual settings but these often are not that accurate and the settings should be avoided. 6. Too much zoom Take photos with a small aperture so that the background is in focus. This often will blur the face. And finally: 7. A second person holding the shot Avoid getting two people in one shot. A second person should take the other shot.

# Chapter 4.3 Photos with a Point & Shoot Canon EOS 350D

Here we are going to learn about different strategies to take good Photos with a Canon EOS 350D point & shoot Camera. We will concentrate on the following"," Also look at the background and consider if it might distort the faces. B. SHUTTING DOWN TOO LOUD Aperture settings of a camera vary. Generally a fast lens and wide aperture are best for pictures of people. But if you are photographing a big group it might be a good idea to open up the aperture so that you can see detail in the background. This avoids a ""boom boom"" effect from everyone's arm, hand or other equipment appearing in the picture. C. SITTING DOWN Avoid putting people on their back. Make them look up, bend down, wave etc. Avoid looking directly at the lens. D. TURNING THE CAMERA ON AUTOMATICALLY It is a good idea to take a picture of the people first, and make sure the shutter is activated. Then if you get a good picture, don't press the shutter button anymore. E. STORING PHOTOS Keep the picture on the camera as long as possible. Most digital cameras have an auto-erase function (if they have a display). This feature stores the picture on the internal storage but erases it from the display. Eliminating the display is not a problem. If your camera does not have an auto-erase function you can put a piece of tape on the back. F. SELECTING THE BEST PHOTO It is a good idea to take several shots and look at all of them. The photographer can then"," B. PHOTOGRAPHING PEOPLE The most important thing is to be patient and to look around a bit. Use the faces to indicate where to focus your lens and take your time. Don’t forget to change the aperture for different faces. Do keep moving around a bit so that people don’t feel that you are trying to take many pictures of the same group. Sometimes you have to walk over to another person to get a different perspective. Practice makes perfect, so be patient and keep looking around. C. MISCELLANOUS TECHNIQUE There are several fundamental techniques to master when you take photos, you can find a good start on the web for these: A. LONG STRAIGHT LIGHTS On a tripod, place your camera on a steady surface and aim the lens at the subject. If necessary you can take a remote control of the shutter release. Use long exposures, open the aperture and keep the shutter released until the desired effect is reached. B. FLASH Mapping Flash is often used as the ideal light source to make a person stand out from the background. A single powerful flash can be enough when the subject is sitting still or in motion. Use the Fill-Flash option in your camera to increase the light intensity. C. HIGH BRIGHTNESS Lenses When you go out for a photo, use a lens with a high ISO- sensitivity which enables you to use a higher ISO in the camera or take a lower-light"
" ‘In fairness I’ve only been doing this for a year. But I feel like I’ve been doing this my whole life.’ ‘I suppose you have.’ She takes a moment to gather her thoughts. ‘Okay, the Globe Hotel. What would you change?’ Christopher Middleton pauses to consider the question. He thinks hard for a moment. Then he recalls the most egregious mistake he can think of: the terrible wine he ordered at dinner the previous evening.  ‘The wine was so bad I was afraid to taste my food.’ Christopher Middleton laughs at his bad joke and Sue Brown smiles at him. Christopher Middleton is from Manchester, England. He is 33 years old and the proprietor of the Globe Hotel. His father owned the hotel until he passed away two years ago. Christopher Middleton will inherit the business when he turns 38 in two years’ time. Two years seems like an eternity to Christopher. ‘So what would you change?’ Christopher Middleton pauses. His eyes dart about the room. For a long time he stands silent, his brow furrowing. Then, at last, he answers, ‘There are so many things I could change. I could hire more staff. I could improve my customer service. I could invest in my technology.’ ‘Good. And what would you change?’ Christopher Middleton takes a deep breath. ‘My most important change would be to recognize the service my employees give me. For years they have worked tirelessly"," The hotel owners are notoriously bad at communication and don’t seem to have understood the most basic of things, like the existence of an inspector. ‘What do you mean? We’ve been phoning them for half an hour now. They haven’t picked up.’ As the inspector observes Christopher, it quickly becomes apparent that he is a seasoned hotelier. ‘Hello? Is this the Globe?’ He seems a bit surprised that she hasn’t worked out the name, but she has the distinct sense that he is covering for the owners who don’t seem to exist at the moment and can’t hear or understand the phone. Christopher knows all about this because he runs a business as well. ‘I work for the company that owns this hotel. We’ve been trying to get you on the phone for the last 15 minutes.’ He gives her the owners number and she accepts the offer of a glass of Champagne to celebrate the success of the year. ‘I’m really disappointed, but I guess the new owners must be a bit slow this year.’

Sue Brown has a unique ability to spot the subtle errors that will ultimately end up costing a business money. She notices that the hoteliers are being deliberately rude to the guest representative. They seem to be deliberately being difficult to the person actually dealing with the clientele and are not communicating effectively. ‘We had the room quoted, the rate was very competitive. It may not be their top of the range"," 'Time for an intervention' Sue tells the receptionist. She pulls the room key from her pocket and dangles it in front of her.  'If you’re so busy I’ll ring your room myself'  Sue says through gritted teeth.  The receptionist looks on with wide-eyed innocence. 'No, no no - you stay right where you are and I’ll do it' she says with authority. Sue Brown takes out her phone and starts to take photographs.  The customer will soon learn of the hotel Inspector's true identity when it's too late. 

Sue walks into the reception area and asks the girl on the desk “Excuse me. I’m a hotel inspector and I’d like to speak to your manager. Do you know where he is?” “No I don’t’” says the receptionist. Sue Brown walks over to the receptionist and taps on her shoulder. “Excuse me. I’m a hotel inspector and I need to speak to your manager immediately”  the receptionist says in disbelief. She turns around, sees the hotel inspector and bursts into tears. “I’m a hotel inspector” Sue says. The receptionist says “I know”  and the hotel inspector says “Well, can you get him for me?”  The receptionist says “I’m trying to”  and the hotel inspector says “Good man’’ and with that, she turns back to her"," After all, how does one greet a guest when one doesn’t even know who they are? 
And so the inspectors descend on the Globe Hotel. The receptionist tries to cover the mess by giving the impression that everything is in order. Christopher Middleton is amazed to see the pristine room they have reserved for him, and his colleague. The manager assures Christopher and his colleague that the room has been booked for the whole month of July but Christopher Middleton feels uneasy. The manager hands over the key and Christopher Middleton and his colleague are on their way to their well-earned rooms. But Christopher Middleton doesn’t feel so confident. Is the room really booked for a whole month? And does the manager know this? Christopher Middleton continues to doubt the manager and as the night goes on he starts to get suspicious. He calls up the receptionist to check if the room is really booked for a whole month. The receptionist confirms the room for the month of July. Christopher Middleton feels relieved. He reaches for his bag and throws his shoes off. Then he picks up his phone and records the hotel’s security guard. But he cannot believe his eyes when a figure in a white polo-neck sweater walks into his hotel room. The figure is wearing a mask over his mouth, and holding Christopher Middleton hostage! It is Christopher Middleton’s own face that is projected on the masked man’s phone. Christopher Middleton’s voice"," 'First impressions are crucial, you need to ensure everything is in order when you walk in.' 'Yeah, we've had a major renovation done in the last year which hasn't been popular with the guests.' 'Really? I didn't know that.' 'Oh yes. Very negative reviews.' 'Wow. We have had a lot of cancellations. A lot of guests haven't liked the atmosphere in the lounge.' 'Yeah, the TV is just down the hall and the complimentary biscuits are in the mini-bar' Sue looks at her watch 'well, we have got about 20 minutes before we have to check out our last two guests. I would love to spend some time with both of you. Where are the rooms?' Chris says over the phone. 'Room 18 and 19' 'Great. You have 15 minutes to clean up this lounge. Then come down and we will go through to the reception area and have a look at the bedrooms. What do you think? Is there anything you would like to improve?' 'Well...' Chris hesitates. 'Well, I would like to get rid of the chocolate biscuits. It's not very hotel-like.' 'Oh I see. You would like to take them with you?’ 'Well, it might look a bit weird if we leave them here, don't you think?' 'Of course I do.' Sue is on her feet, her arm outstretched. 'Do you want to take them or not?' '"," She has even coined a word for it: 'the Globey'. 

But Sue’s frustration and disappointment is somewhat muted by the fact that, in a hotel this tiny and its customers this short-attention-span, there could be huge gains to be had by improving on the basic performance levels of its staff. 

Christopher Middleton, the manager of the Globe Hotel and the potential new customer Sue is trying to save, is clearly a man of great personal charisma. His welcoming words to Sue when she arrives are tinged with warmth. ‘Wife would be most proud of me’. The man himself is dressed in a stylish black suit, white shirt and red tie and he sports a pair of perfectly-coiffed locks. He too can be charming when he puts his mind to it. And there’s something very 'hip' about his choice of hotel. His staff have even dubbed him 'the Globey'. But for all his charisma and his apparently well-paid position, Christopher’s hotel has one obvious weakness - he’s clearly not very good with people. 

This afternoon the Globe Hotel is hosting a prestigious government delegation, and Christopher seems to be out to lunch from the moment he enters the reception area. Within minutes, he's sent half a dozen of the staff on a cross-examination - asking them to repeat their reports back to him, even as he himself doesn't know what questions are being asked. He"," 
‘Well that's odd.’ Christopher Middleton had been watching proceedings from the edge of the lobby. It was 10 o'clock at night and he had arrived just in time for the first guest to check in. Christopher was the head of the largest internet marketing company in the South-East Asian region and had spent the preceding months developing an automated system that would detect hotel scams and identify fraudsters. 'They have made a complaint of identity theft' he says. ‘They said they recognised the name but it wasn't current and they were shocked that they had fallen for it. I've made a formal complaint to the police.' Christopher is a short, balding man with a keen interest in fraud prevention, cyber security and counter terrorism. ‘I wonder who's behind it? Maybe we will find out when I get to the police station.' 
Christopher stares in disbelief. He has just arrived at the police station just five minutes later and all he has heard so far is that the hotel's manager was arrested for trying to sell a fake passport at the front desk. 'But it must have been someone in the police force who set up the sting...' he begins to argue but his words are cut short as he is told that the police officer would like to speak to him. He reluctantly leaves the police station and follows the crowd, his heart beating a bit faster. He heads for the police station, and finds police officials busy debriefing the hotel manager,"
" Despite its many benefits, there are still significant concerns around its validity. In recent years, the scientific basis for handwriting analysis has become increasingly questionable, and is in danger of being discredited.

Pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst was published in 2006 and written by Gary Greenberg and David Matalon. The full text is available here.


Some of the concerns around handwriting analysis are:

It does not require any special training to be able to carry out handwriting analysis. Anyone can do it. 
It is based on subjective impressions which may or may not be accurate.
It is only valid for certain groups of people such as doctors, students and business people.
It does not provide any useful predictions of a person's behaviour.


The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst raises awareness of the challenges associated with handwriting analysis and provides examples of studies which tried to validate it.


You can find out more about handwriting analysis by following the link here


Although handwriting analysis is not widely accepted as a valid science by the majority of researchers in the field of psychology, the subject has generated a lot of interest amongst the general public and certain governments have even shown support for its inclusion in the selection procedures for certain positions.


It is very important to remember that handwriting analysis is only as valid as the person or people carrying out the analysis. Also, it should not be used as a decisive factor in the hiring process because there are other"," But its legitimacy is called into question by the fact that it is sometimes used for blackmail, extortion and threats to public security. 

Handwriting analysis can reveal a persons character and can also be used as a tool for psychological or criminal guidance. 

Handwriting analysis relies on the scientific method and the premise that handwriting is actually a unique, individualised expression of the writer. To interpret this expression a set of standardised criteria must first be established to standardise the way in which the handwriting is to be analysed. Then it is necessary to employ trained analysts to apply these criteria to the handwriting of each candidate being assessed and create a profile of that person. From these profiles various inferences can be made with a high degree of certainty. 

The problem is that there is currently a significant lack of standardisation within the handwriting analysis industry. 

One critic of handwriting analysis argues that there are inherent weaknesses in the scientific method and the premise that handwriting is actually a unique, individualised expression of the writer. He argues that there are several well documented cases of individuals writing similarly even though they are from the same generation, have the same job and live in the same household. This has led some researchers to question the validity of the field. 

Critics also argue that the criteria by which handwriting is characterised are not always scientifically rigorous. Furthermore, trained analysts must interpret the writing of candidates in order to arrive at a profile of that person. The critics argue that there is a high degree"," The writing samples are generally taken using a special pen with a hard graphite tip and are analyzed using special computer programs that make comparisons between the handwriting samples. The writing is often compared with standard handwriting samples of well known writers. While graphology may seem to be a fringe practice, it’s actually gaining ground especially in the United States where a number of governments have invested in the science to improve criminal justice and perhaps employment practices. A study by a British organization, for example, found that the analysis of handwriting could improve predictions of job success by 22% and that the cost per success was much less than using other hiring methods. Handwriting analysis has also been proven useful in predicting success or failure of new products and services. There are a few caveats however to avoid misinterpretation or just plain fraud. Firstly, there’s no standard or definitive way to write, so even if two samples look similar, they might actually be different and thus not comparable. Secondly, some individuals are naturally not suited to handwriting analysis and it might not be able to properly interpret their characteristics and thus might not be of much use. A few people might take offense at the suggestion that their personality can be revealed by their handwriting and some would say that anyone can disguise their true nature by writing differently. As for fraudulent practices it might be interesting to note that the handwriting of a serial killer may look similar to that of a psychopath and vice versa. Additionally, some people might intentionally write similar or identical samples in order to","

Handwriting analysts may ask for samples of your handwriting in court to authenticate evidence or when interviewing a candidate for a job. It is also often part of a psychological evaluation when considering if someone should be awarded sickness benefits. The most famous case of this was when Michael Jackson’s doctor was also called as a witness to testify in the defense of Jackson. But despite its increasing use and recognition by governments and businesses worldwide, handwriting analysis remains controversial.

Although the study of handwriting is still in its infancy, there is enough evidence to support the notion that the quality of your handwriting can reveal a lot about yourself. In many countries such as the United Kingdom, students are encouraged to practice their penmanship under the supervision of an expert teacher. However, there are very few schools that actually fund this and most parents and students find it easier to find an affordable alternative such as the services of a handwriting expert at a reasonable fee. In some schools where this is not the case, students have been taught cursive writing. Cursive handwriting is generally considered as the lowest grade of handwriting and is an informal script. It is characterized by the appearance of individual strokes and the formation of curves. Curves that meet at the corner of each stroke are generally regarded as being formed more co-operatively whereas curves that cross on top of each other are regarded as being formed less co-operatively.

The first grade of cursive writing is generally regarded as the most difficult and difficult to form curves and"," Although we’ve known about this science for some 150 years now we still do not know how the individual creates a hand. Theories exist regarding the influence of the subconscious. It has also been suggested that the hand is guided by a subliminal force. The hand seems to have some inner will of its own that creates letters that are more efficient than the most logical ones. Handwriting is perhaps the only human skill that is a completely involuntary act. So now you know that handwriting analysis is a science. It can be a useful tool for understanding the person. Don’t underestimate the power of the pen.

  1. Graphology or handwriting analysis is a science that indicates certain illnesses and psychological states.

  2. Handwriting analysis is being used for vocational guidance and interviews.

  3. Although we know how the individual creates a hand - the theories regarding the influence of the subconscious - it is still a completely involuntary act.

  4. Handwriting is a powerful tool for understanding the person.

  5. Don’t underestimate the power of the pen.

  6. Although this science has been around for 150 years - it is still in its infancy.

Letters created by the hand have more logical forms than we usually imagine. It’s a very complex art of expression.

  7. Handwriting analysis is still in the infancy of its science. Many research papers can be found on the internet.

  8. This"," For many people who are not aware of its potential, handwriting analysis can provide a surprising insight into their personal characteristics, including their hidden emotions and character traits. 

The term graphology was first coined in the late 1800s by Dr Solomon Shephard of Boston. It was based on the writings on palmistry. Graphology deals with the analysis of the formation of the lines and angles of the hand, as well as the form and expression of the letters and words. It is based on the premise that the configuration of the lines and angles on the hand, and how they are grouped and interfered with, has a correspondence with the configuration of lines and angles on the brain. Handwriting analysis is used in various aspects of criminal law and psychology and has been suggested as a valid method for establishing guilt or innocence. 

Most people do not realise how much the analysis of their handwriting can reveal about them. This form of personal communication can reveal whether someone has been diagnosed with depression, they may have an alcohol problem or perhaps they are about to take their first steps into committing suicide. In the criminal justice system, handwriting analysis has been used in court as an indication of guilt or innocence and has also been suggested as a valid method for establishing guilt or innocence. In fact, in certain countries handwriting analysis has been incorporated as an additional part of the criminal procedure. This science of handwriting has been gaining acceptance since the late 1800s. 

The early stages of the handwriting analysis industry have revolved"," It is accepted as valid evidence in court cases. While there is no hard evidence of its effectiveness, people often find they are better off with a good personality than their handwriting would indicate. It seems to have a lot to do with having confidence and not being too critical of oneself. 

In the text above it is clear that the text is about handwriting analysis and how it can provide insights to certain aspects of one’s personality. The text contains sufficient information to allow the inference that it can provide insights to illnesses and whether one has a good or bad personality. Furthermore, the text does not contain information overload, but uses an appropriate amount of complexity to the topic.

" In short, whilst there is a small amount of evidence to suggest that volunteering contributes positively to development, the amount that does is minimal. 

B. On the other hand, there are a number of significant benefits to volunteering. Firstly, it provides the opportunity for people to give of their time to make an impact on others lives, something which is arguably more difficult when you receive payment for doing so. Secondly, it allows you to work with individuals from a range of different backgrounds, with different values, and in a non-hierarchical environment: the need for a person to report to a person for example, is more likely to lead to an environment of trust than one where people report to an administration. 

Thirdly, it forces people to develop strong relationships with people they might not otherwise know well, with the chance to form a bond that can last a lifetime. 

C. Whilst I personally cannot speak from personal experience of volunteering abroad, from what I do know of the subject it is undoubtedly an excellent thing to do.


D. Thus, whilst I would be reluctant to characterise volunteering abroad as ""the most effective method of development"" it is undoubtedly a good thing and one which should be encouraged in order to give local workers the opportunity to engage with the skills they may lack, for a chance to give of their time to make the world a better place.


A:

A few arguments:

The actual contribution"," In addition, volunteers can be relied on to commit for a specified time frame (which the host community may not be able to fill) and to commit to return later should they wish to. B. Whilst A can bemoan the amount of money that is donated to international voluntary work it is worth noting that large organisations such as WWF receive significant financial support from taxpayers worldwide and have to ensure that it is spent on their intended programme whilst still maintaining a profit margin. Additionally, B may not recognise the skill set of the volunteers who are contributing to their community, or realise the contribution they make in terms of their spending the money. C. Volunteers are known to spend many hours working in the host community which provides opportunities for the volunteers and the community. There is also the benefit of a greater awareness in a community of what its challenges are and the exposure to these through the volunteer. D. Whilst A can criticise the cost of volunteer work it should also be noted that volunteer work can be an excellent experience for those looking to volunteer which provides both the knowledge and skillset to better run a similar programme on their own terms. E. It is generally cheaper for tourists to visit communities to contribute to the development of locals via volunteer work. This is due to the large number of volunteers that need to be recruited and the limited scope for profit on offer. As a result tourists will pay to take on an internship in a local NGO, or to partake in a community activity in a country"," B. It is also questionable whether the ""economic and moral benefits"" that Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO) promote justify the fees they charge VSO workers for their services. There are significant cost to the VSO organisation for providing these workers with a comfortable environment to work in, whilst the benefits claimed by VSO workers are often trivial compared to the cost. This is because, to an Overseas Development Institute survey of almost 7000 volunteers, 42 per cent of volunteers reported they had not met a local person who lacked basic health or education facilities. Furthermore, the benefits of having a local workforce who have received basic education are dubious given that many people on a voluntary service do not return to their communities after their stint is up. C. As VSO work is largely conducted by individuals who are not paid a salary for their time, they are therefore not contributing to the taxation of their home country and so are not truly ""paying their fair share.""  Volunteer tourism is in fact often more expensive than employment in the destination community, and there is a risk that those on such services will be less committed to their communities than those employed in the local economy. D. It is also worth noting that VSO workers will often be subject to strict quotas that may limit the contribution they are able to make to the societies in which they live.  There is therefore little to be gained from having a volunteer workforce in return for the fee charged by VSO organisations. There"," B. There are of course significant drawbacks to volunteer tourism and as an ethical matter many would argue that the activities involved do not fall under the auspices of volunteering. Firstly it should be noted that the term ""volunteer"" implies that the activity is undertaken voluntarily. This is in no way implied in some of the projects undertaken by volunteers, such as the one in Uganda. The second ethical issue concerns the financial contribution that many of these volunteers make. Many of the volunteers that undertake projects in Uganda and similar contexts have paid significant fees to institutions to get involved. Many of these organisations have spent significant funds to gain the opportunity to recruit volunteer tourists who will then pay their fees to the organisations involved. For example the British Council spent £1,800,000 on its ""Leaders for Change"" training initiative alone in 2012. Whilst this expense may be justified to some the recipients of this fee in the Ugandan communities will often feel exploited: money intended for development has ended up benefiting individuals rather than the communities that these projects would benefit directly. In conclusion, whilst there are significant ethical arguments for and against volunteer tourism they seem to be a small contributor to the development of the societies where they operate, and have significant drawbacks. This, however, is to be expected with non-profit organisations. Whilst a portion of the fees may be returned to the charities involved (often through a transfer to the charity of the profits of a similar business) many do not. It is estimated that"," So the economic contribution of voluntary work is likely not to be enormous, though it may be that volunteering enables people to be part of a community that is in some way better off than they would be otherwise. B. On balance, international voluntary work is likely to be of some positive contribution to development globally. Whilst there is likely to be a small economic contribution from international volunteers giving their labour, this small sum is likely to be better spent than if it were donated by individuals or organisations directly to a local community. C. The contribution of international voluntary work to development globally is probably of some benefit. The key economic contribution of international voluntary work may be to enable people to be involved in an activity that is more rewarding and enriching than working for an organisation directly. This is likely to be of benefit to the individual volunteerr and the community they are involved with, and this benefit may be of considerable economic value.

Answer A

International voluntary work can provide some direct contribution to development. It can enable people to build homes for poor communities or schools for less well off communities. There is also the financial contribution of paying volunteers for the opportunity to be involved in this kind of work.

These contributions are likely to be small but are likely to be worth more than what would be donated by individuals or organizations to communities directly.

The narrative can be illustrated as follows:

A. International voluntary work can enable people to be part of a community that is better off than they"," In addition, whilst the actual physical contribution of tourists to the development of a country can be substantial, the symbolic contribution of tourists to the development of a country is often far less so. Tourists want to experience everything first-hand, and whilst it can be useful for a tourist to get a feel for the local culture before deciding whether to make a long-term commitment to live there it is difficult to make a positive symbolic contribution to a country's development when one has little local knowledge. Finally, whilst tourists are able to travel around the world at little cost, they are also able to purchase a vast range of goods at little cost as these tourists spend money in the host countries in order to spend money abroad. Tourists thus have no real financial interest in the development of host countries and so their financial support is unlikely to lead to anything other than a short-term increase in a country's GDP: a result which is unlikely to make a significant contribution to development. B. However, this criticism overlooks some key points: firstly, whilst volunteers do not have significant technical or professional skills, they do have significant amounts of time and energy to contribute to projects; and secondly, whilst volunteers cannot make a positive symbolic contribution to the development of a country, they can make an immediate, positive impact on the lives of those they serve by building them houses or schools. C. Whilst A's criticism over-emphasises the lack of financial interest of tourists in the development of host countries, it"," The volunteer is unlikely to be paying rent or running an electric or water supply. However, the work they provide is not of the highest order. In some situations they may be training local staff to use the tools or equipment the volunteers have provided. They may also be supervising local volunteers who would not be able to undertake much if any independent labour. However, in other situations they are likely to be the ones doing the more heavy or menial labor: cleaning, building, or supervising the local labour force. The volunteers are unlikely to be contributing much labour. They have not paid to undertake these activities. In many cases they may not even be aware of the extent of the labour required by the local volunteers. B. The volunteer does not contribute much to local communities directly. Rather they provide a technical skill that, although minimal, can be donated to a local community, providing that the community has neither the wherewithal to absorb the labour required to create this technology, nor the expertise required to utilise it. The volunteer does not contribute much directly to local communities. C. Volunteer tourists provide a technical skill that can be donated to a local community. D. Volunteer tourists provide an opportunity for local volunteers to do the heavier or more menial labour that they would not otherwise be able to undertake. E. In the above discussion, volunteers offer the opportunity for local volunteers to do the heavier or more menial labour that they would not otherwise be able to undertake. F. Local volunteers"
" This can provide a better understanding of the development of a particular school of Greek or Roman art at a particular stage in its history, for example the transition from the 'Caryatid' style to the 'Lion Hunter' style in the 4th century AD. In this way the Museum not only shows how the masterpieces that make it up were made but how they were made by the great classical sculptors of the past. It can also inform us how to best preserve the originals in order to prevent damage in the future. 

B. The origins of the casts The collection was first assembled from the late 19th century by Austro-Hungarian diplomats, soldiers and archaeologists. The first excavations in Greece that produced any substantial finds of Greek vases and metalwork were undertaken by archaeologist Philipp von Hagelschart in the 1880s. These finds were initially stored in a warehouse in Budapest and were later taken to Vienna by von Hagelschart and his assistant Ludwig Boltzmann, who had them cast in the studio of a local goldsmith.

These earliest finds were followed by excavations and finds of Roman material in the region and in 1893 Austrian and Hungarian archaeologist Pál Tósfia and sculptor-engraver János Kovács established the casts in Vienna, making a selection of the most important examples. In 1900 they began sending the casts abroad, initially to Berlin, where they were loaned to a variety of prominent museums"," The sculptures are often much more impressive than the originals, despite any restoration or fiddly repairs to the original setting. Plaster casts can be cleaned and polished, as opposed to the dust and dirt that often covers originals. The biggest drawback of plaster casts is that they are not ‘original’. Rather, they are simply accurate and highly accurate replicas of the originals, and the only way to know this is to carry out a scientific analysis using a range of modern methods including laser scanning, 3D digitising and image recognition. You may wonder what this has to do with the story of King Kong. Plaster casts are particularly useful for the scenes of wildlife because the animals are often portrayed in a natural pose and not in a pose that has been moulded or chiselled from the original. Analysis of the plaster casts provides clear evidence of the techniques and methods used to create the original sculptures. Plaster casts can also reveal evidence of how a sculptor’s hand would have worked, revealing different aspects of the same animal or even different parts of the same animal and thereby providing insights into how a sculptor would have created the original. These kinds of insights could not be obtained through the original sculptures themselves. In addition, casts can be invaluable for understanding how a sculptor would have created a scene – not only can you study the sculpture and imagine how the sculptor would have created the scene, but now you can imagine the scene in front of you and therefore start to see"," This enables you to get a more complete picture of the collection's breadth and depth. You can also see a lot of the same sculptures in different settings and poses allowing a better appreciation of the artist's technique and versatility.  

The earliest sculptures on display date from the 9th century BC and span the time period from the Middle Archaic period through the Cycladic and Milos periods.  These works are the earliest examples of Cycladic and Minoan art, and date back as far as 2500 years before the Common Era.  They include head of Medusa, the Laocöon, and the Dioskourides Group. These earliest works are well represented in the Museum.  

The Cycladic and Minoan art style spread to mainland Greece and the Aegean in the 8th century BC and the Late Classical period (750-350 BC).  This transition is reflected in the collection, although the number of examples is much smaller.  This artistic development is illustrated by examples of the Nydourides Group of statues of children playing, and of the ""Victory Group"" of athletic figures. 

The Classical period is exemplified by numerous statues of athletic and martial figures, as well as by statues of notable Athenian citizens and of animals.  Examples are those of the Biston Group (of horses), of the Dioskourides Group (the Laocöon and Medusa), and of the Nike of Samothrace group"," The Museum's collection is divided into eleven main subcollections: Ancient Greek and Roman Sculpture, Roman Sculpture of the Early Empire, Greek and Roman Sculpture of the Julio-Claudian Period, Hellenistic and Roman Sculpture, the Laocötes Collection, the Euboutzes Collection, the Collection of the Hellenistic Museum at Berlin, the Museum's Collection of the Roman and Roman Greek Period, the Italian Collection, the Collection of the Glyptothek, the Collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and the Collection of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.


B. Cast of a marble torso from the collection of the German Archaeological Institute showing the muscularity of the sculptures. Casting technology had progressed sufficiently for realistic muscularity to be portrayed by the 19th century.


C. Cast of a marble torso from the collection of the German Archaeological Institute, showing the realistic muscularity of the sculptures.


D. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology possesses six hundred casts of Greek and Roman sculpture, most dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. All of the sculptures are copies made by casting the originals.


E. All the sculptures in the collection are copies made by casting the originals.


F. The museum was founded in 1858. The collection was originally divided into eleven subcollections, one of which is the Laocötes"," Original moulds and details of each sculptural form can be viewed with great detail, and each can be easily photographed and/or filmed. The works are clearly labelled with brief Latin and Greek inscriptions. In addition, the Museum’s casts can be easily transported – a clear advantage for those working in excavation or repair, for example. There are many advantages to plaster casts over other less-detailed methods of representation, such as those based on papyrus, vellum or linen but they also have some limitations. Casting the sculpture from the original stone can sometimes produce unexpected distortions, especially around the joins and angles where the stone has been chipped and cut during excavation, or the figure has been moved by the action of the votive priest. Many of the Greek and Roman sculptures represent the powerful and are thus particularly likely to attract the attention of thieves.

B. The Moche Culture The Moche Culture flourished from 200 to 1000 AD in what is now northern Peru. During this period the Moche culture created a system of massive burial grounds, or tumbas, which were later rediscovered in the 16th century in southern Peru at locations such as Chan Chan. These sites are vast and complex burial grounds that comprise structures for both housing the deceased and honouring them, temples, tombs for the urns and all the associated funerary equipment, and an abundance of remains of Moche burials. One of the most notable of these remains are"," The disadvantages of plaster casts are many; although the sculptures look very lifelike, some of the joints are not accurate, for example the marble skull with the hole for the nasal bone.  
 
B. The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world comprising over six hundred works. The collection dates back to the beginning of the 19th century, when professors at the University of Naples gathered money to establish a museum with examples of Greek and Roman sculptures. The collection is now on display in the University Museum of Classical Archaeology in Naples.   The University Museum of Classical Archaeology is a treasure trove of authentic antique sculpture, including hundreds of rare and well-preserved Greek and Roman masterpieces. The collection includes both copies and original antique sculptures.  
 
C. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology was built to house the collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture. It opened in 1991 in Naples, Italy, and today includes over 6 hundred objects. The collection includes replicas from 19th century casts as well as original antique sculptures from Greece and Rome.  
 
D. As you enter the University Museum of Classical Archaeology, your first impression will be of light, with large windows and several natural lightings. The Museum has a sense of calm and peace, a feeling enhanced by the sound of flowing water in the surrounding garden. The collection includes both copies and original antique sculptures. 
 
E."," Unfortunately, casts are not without their disadvantages. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals and as such lack the distinctive features of the artists that created them. This means there is little in the way of individuality and all the sculptures look the same. There is, however, a very good collection of both Greek and Roman bronzes from the Classical period. Some of the more famous works from the collection include: The Battle of Pharsalus (c. 350 BC)
Pirgos mountain formation (early 4th Century BC)
Athena Polychroma, the Winged Nike (c. 445 BC)
Euripides, Bacchae (420–395 BC)
Doryphoros (Late Roman Period)
One of the highlights of the collection is the Erechtheion (Greek Temple of Athens) group of marble sculptures originally set up in Athens c. 438–432 BC. The Erechtheion was completed by Polykleitos (c. 445– c. 415 BC), and comprises of Athena in Epiphany (c. 438 BC), Erechtheus (c. 432 BC), Theseus (c. 430 BC) and Leontios (c. 429 BC) who is credited with the design and construction of the base. This original collection was divided in 1607 between Brussels and Rome with the Erechtheion being separated from the remainder of the collection. The"
" Insecurity. I didn't like myself very much and it showed. The customers liked me more. I was a better waitress. 

Which seems a reasonable decision for a 24/7 world of customer interaction, but I found myself repeating my actions in moments of uncertainty. On the job I dealt with bullying bosses, jealous colleagues, difficult subordinates and often had to put up with insensitive customers. Smiling helped me to hide my discomfort. I was also becoming a magnet for abuse. When I was late to an appointment a customer would pick a fight with me, telling me how sorry he was for not seeing me arrive. 'Smile and put together the pieces' I told myself. 'Smile, fake a smile, be pleasant, you'll feel better' I repeated.

As time went on I became less willing to put up with anything. I developed an aversion to conflict. I stopped taking on new clients, waiting for my bus in the morning or driving home at night. On my next trip to the hairdressers I looked at the mirror and saw a woman with no eyebrows. I was mortified, but didn't want to tell the barber. I thought I looked ridiculous. So did he. As my confidence faded so did my smile. I was becoming a robot.

I started to feel ill. I stopped eating breakfast. My weight started dropping. My mood deteriorated. I felt useless. I started to believe my own lie."," I was actually damaging my own self-confidence. Smiling is not enough - self-confidence needs to be developed and cultivated. If I do find myself in a position of power (which hopefully won't ever happen while I'm working in a restaurant! ) I will make sure that I practice my 'power smile' regularly to keep my self-confidence high. 

### Power Smile 
Power Smile is just like a regular smile but you are sure about what you are feeling and what you are going to do next. You will project that power personell you want to be and it will be reflected in the way you behave towards others.


#### Exercise
1. Go to your office and write down your top 3 powers in the first person - for example ""Today I will: project a certain level of confidence, handle conflict in a mature way and make the difficult decision"". 
2. Now think about an occasion when you felt confident to be yourself (not just in a professional context) and write down 3 concrete actions you took to show you felt confident. For example ""When I was walking down the street with my partner this morning and wanted to stop and talk to a passerby I knew I could do that because I felt confident"". 
3. Think about an occasion when you displayed strength of character (not just in a professional context) and write down 3 concrete actions you took to show that. For example ""When I wanted to stand up for a"," I had no idea how to manage people or how to carry out basic tasks. I was terrible at my job. My smile was not acting as a shield but was in fact a bludgeon - and I was letting everyone and everything off the hook. I was acting exactly as I was taught to not act in a classroom when the teacher had told us that'smiling is the most efficient way to make your point clear to others'. I was acting too nicely. When things went wrong, I saw myself being the good girl - telling the truth, never causing a scene and saying sorry. But I didn't realise that I was behaving this way in order to avoid facing up to the fact that I had no idea how to do my job and needed guidance. And so, I gave it to myself.  I was trying to make up for my lack of competence. I was trying to be a good person - and so I was. When the evening came to an end and I went home, the relief I felt was nothing like the relief I should have felt. And so, after the first year I decided to take some time out. I worked hard at my next job - but I could see myself still trying to be the good person. So I worked hard on developing the capacity to be less nice. I found some help from an understanding manager - who had been in my shoes - and through a series of carefully thought out exercises I was able to observe my negative patterns. I began"," I was, of course, acting much too nicest and it simply led to my downfall. I got myself into trouble because I was too nice. It didn't work. I was too nice. What was I thinking?

I remind myself sternly that although smiling makes other people happy I should be careful not to compromise my own well-being in return.

My experience is not unique. Many of us are too nice for our own good. We need to understand when it's right to be nice and when it's a liability. We need to make our intentions clear and stand up for ourselves in a world that often fails to respect our needs. Being nice is something we should continue to practise but not at the cost of our own well-being. As A2 learners we need to take the next step and become competent at this new skill of 'being less approachable'. This will mean being slightly more guarded in our approach to other people. When we want something from another person we will approach them with greater care and consideration - but that should not mean that we are passive-aggressive. Rather we should approach others with courtesy and ask for what we are entitled to. We need to develop the skill of being a little less approachable but not so little that we don't stand up for our own rights. In other words, I still need to behave myself but maybe with a little less smiles and a lot more demands for what is mine.

'Are you okay?' he asked when he saw the stains on my blouse. 'I can imagine what a good cook you must be' I replied. But inside I was seething. I wondered, was he laughing at me? And I soon found out when I realised that he didn't eat chicken or rice. He ate vegetables.

This approach may be successful in getting things done quickly and without question. But it also limits my autonomy and confidence - and ultimately I end up with nothing to show for my efforts but a heap of smithereens and a bad reputation. So I must be even more aggressive.

" The cabin shook as the KC-135 taxied to the runway. Then it was up he went, a smooth upward flight that was made even more exciting because the downward force of gravity was reversed. The young passengers were now weighing 7 kilometres per hour and gaining height at an astonishing rate. After 40 minutes they had climbed to 40 kilometres and still they gained height. It was a triumph of science that would never be replicated.

It was not until 1995, 20 years later, that the United States Coast Guard certified that microgravity was possible to human-rated levels. In space.

A:

That's not what spaceflight is. Spaceflight is the absence of Earth's gravitational force.

Astronaut corps member Jim Irwin explains what spaceflight is: ""Spaceflight is the absence of the Earth's gravitational force, so for example, traveling between the Earth and the Moon would be considered spaceflight because you're in freefall, and that's in space. You are weightless. You're not feeling your body through your organs and your bones and your skin. You're weightless. That's what spaceflight is.""

A:

There is no clear definition for Spaceflight in the English language. A recent news article about Virgin Galactic and its first flights to suborbital space contains the following sentence: 

Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by Sir Richard Branson, has conducted the first test flights of its spacecraft and"," As the plane taxied along at slow pace, the silence was broken only by the sounds of a nervous passenger saying ""We are on a nuclear submarine!"" ""Nuclear submarine"" was met with a cheer from the group. Soon the engines started and the plane rose into the air - no gravity, anyone's for the next hour, two hours. And what a party it was, no one could keep still or say a quiet prayer. One student exclaimed ""I want to go again"". Another declared ""Next time with a bigger group I want to do a vertical take-off and landing, I want to go up in the sky, I want to fly!"", but alas, there was a next time. And another. And another. The thrill of weightlessness and new discoveries were what kept the young students entertained as the trip progressed. As the plane ascended, they could begin to see into the distance and were surprised to discover a city there, a thriving city with tall skyscrapers, a city that was still under construction. Soon, the student's wonderland of possibilities came to an abrupt end. The plane began a rapid descent. The pilot called out, ""We have landed!"". As they did, the students leapt from their seats. The feeling of weightlessness was no more, their stomachs grumbled. They quickly gathered their belongings and filed out. As they left the plane, they noted the concrete floor that was the only sign that they had"," One by one the young men were drawn into the tank, held over the back of a chair then gently lowered until their feet touched the floor. Another plane, an experimental plane, had landed. A man from the plane quickly opened the back doors and three of the men began to descend, a couple of feet at a time. Mumford looked on in amazement as one of them suddenly seemed to be flying through the air. He stepped forward and, to everyone’s amazement, jumped up and down and did somersaults. The young man who seemed to fly was given a round of applause. As the others were removed another student, a young woman, descended in what was clearly an impressively close shave. She too was quickly strapped in. The plane began to move. After just a few seconds it started to rock. Another student began to panic, screaming at the pilot who simply replied that he couldn’t help her. The pilot then turned to Tom Mumford and said “we need to go”. Tom watched as the students all jumped off and ran across the runway to where a similar-looking plane was waiting. Once the last student was inside a man in a white overall opened the plane’s rear door and a small explosion filled the air. The man turned to the waiting journalist and said “that was strange” then shut the door. Mumford was taken to a nearby town where he was interviewed by the local newspaper. He also had the unique opportunity"," There were six in the back where Mumford, a freelance science journalist from Toronto, was to fly with his son, a former Royal Air Force navigator. At least the KC-135 has artificial gravity. The plane's pilot was trying to shake off Canadian regulatory authorities and had refused to reveal the full details of the mission, but Mumford and his son had been invited. The pair were part of a group of 13 young researchers and students who had come to study the effects of weightlessness on the human body at the European Space Agency in Darmstadt, Germany. Their study had been funded by NASA but had to cancel their trip when the ESA cancelled all future manned flights due to budgetary pressures. They would now have to wait another 15 years before human space flight would again be on the agenda for the European Space Agency. ""It was very nerve-racking to be honest with you. We were sitting there in a totally dark aircraft with no windows or anything,"" recalled Mumford. ""You have this sensation of falling and you reach out for something to hold on to but there is nothing. You realise you're in an aircraft and that's about it. It was scary but also exhilarating."" The group were testing the hypothesis that microgravity, or the lack of it, might have an adverse effect on bone density and muscle mass as the bones and muscles lose the pull of gravity on their fibers. The experiment was devised by Professor Martin Almond, head of the"," Outside Mumford could hear excited voices, a mix of disbelief, excitement, terror and wonder. He climbed into one of the seats in the back row, but his seatbelt pulled him into a hugging position. ""I'm okay for a minute, right?"" he shouted to the man next to him. He nodded and Mumford looked out of the window to see if the aircraft was moving. It was, but surprisingly slowly. They had been in space less than an hour and were travelling at three kilometres per second. Mumford peered over the seats and scanned the landscape outside through a large window. The students were all gazing around with unquestioning wonder. Mumford turned to his companion. ""Did you notice that we are in space?"" he asked. He was still stunned by the experience, but happy to be alive. He looked over at his colleague, a physicist. The two of them had been on the project because they could see an opportunity to investigate if Newton's third law of motion - for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction - was correct or not. They did not know what to expect, but both were certain this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The American scientist pulled out a digital camera to record the event, as his colleague had done on earlier flights. As the minutes passed, their view through the window began to change from a landscape of blue sky and clouds into a blur as the spacecraft began to slow down. Mumford"," The plane was only designed to stay in the air for fifteen minutes so the pilot gave them an introduction and asked them to observe the controls and the data screens which showed the flight instruments in use. The engines were running, the engines of the Boeing 707 were running, but they wouldn't be needed for the rest of the flight. Moments later the captain opened a side door and a man in a spacesuit stepped out, a man who looked a bit worried, and who turned out to be the Russian professor who had carried out the research that the American journalist Tom Mumford came to find out more about. 

This sample passage contains the following sentence patterns:

It looked like just another aircraft from the outside.

The sentence structure is standard, with a main clause containing the independent verb look and the relative clause containing another independent verb, from the outside, which functions as a subject of the main verb looked. The structure is unremarkable, except that the word just in the dependent clause may be viewed as overly verbose, especially since it is identical to the word just in the independent clause.

A Boeing 707 passenger craft. But appearances were deceptive and the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for the flight of their lives. Inside it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out apart from a few at the back where the pale"," Mumford saw four students move across the cabin to the rear where they sat down, but as he looked again one of the men appeared to have fallen asleep. It didn't occur to the reporter that he was one of the participants in what became a 10-hour ordeal for him. As they taxied along the runway it looked like a particularly beautiful morning in the sunflower patch of a small French airport and the 747's engines started with the feeling of a new beginning. They passed the point of no return and the Boeing 747 began to leave the earth's atmosphere. The silence was intense. Then came the rumble of the tanker's four Rolls-Royce Tyne engines. Mumford's mind turned to the great divide between theory and practice, between knowledge and faith. As they left the atmosphere the 747 began to climb with the aid of thrust created by the two engines of the tanker. Then the crew cut the engines and they were weightless for ten seconds. It felt quite pleasant, almost pleasant enough to distract from the fact that they were in an aircraft which had lost all of its engines and were drifting in space. As the tanker's engines cut out the students began to panic and Mumford saw five of them tumble from their seats. The pilot fought to regain control of the 747 which started to lose altitude. Mumford and a colleague were fortunate to clamber back into their seats as the 747 began to drop towards the earth"
" Picasso had been watching us from a nearby table and came over to us with his lunchbox to introduce himself. ""I am a great painter"", he said, ""you must have seen my work."" ""I am a great painter"", I said, ""I have seen your work, but I'm afraid I don't understand."" Picasso took out a wallet and flipped it open. ""This is my passport,"" he said. ""In any case you must be able to recognise my work."" I didn't recognise it then and do not now, but I am happy to accept his passport as a token of his infinite promise.


And so the day began.  By the time I finished my university studies, I was already involved in a wide variety of artistic pursuits. My childhood had been shaped by a peripatetic and nomadic lifestyle so my artistic curiosity was well and truly ignited. The combination of my nomadic childhood and adolescence in Europe and later in the Middle East combined with my university studies in Germany and Belgium, meant that I was well positioned to explore the many exciting cultural and artistic milieux of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as to immerse myself in the visual culture of Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy and Egypt.


It was in Greece, in 1971 that I saw my first artwork. It was of an ancient battleship in Athens harbor and I felt a shiver of recognition. It was the same year that the famous","

I had been asked by a local gallery owner to paint the mural in her gallery. Picasso was the subject of a major exhibition at the gallery which I had helped to organise and was one of the painters featured. He was on the town’s art scene, famous and well-loved. The artist, who turned 79 in May, seemed down to earth and very approachable. So we stood and talked for some time. And as I mentioned, I was very lucky to have my sketchbook with me as we talked and to draw and paint as he talked.


While Picasso was famous I was just a fan but my enthusiasm for his paintings grew as I listened to our conversation. He had done the large mural in the rear of the gallery himself using vivid colours and bright strokes that seemed to leap from the wall. But he had a lot of help from his friends, including a famous Spanish painter who was in the city on a trip of his own.

I was especially interested in the theme of love depicted in the mural. As we conversed and Picasso filled our cups from a vending machine outside the restaurant I was able to get close enough to take his portrait in the style of the artist himself, and then study his brush work and observe how he painted on such a large scale.

I sketched a number of details of the mural and as I drew noticed a dark patch on the far right wall that looked","

I was drawn to the cafe on several occasions when I was waiting for the van to pick up my next painting assignment, and each time was disappointed by the dilapidated surroundings. But on the day I was unable to control my curiosity and climbed out of the van just behind Picasso who was at a nearby table. I sat down and asked him if he would pose for a portrait. He agreed and I produced the only drawing in my portfolio. He was very kind and the artist made me a coffee while I waited. When the portfolio was returned I was very impressed by his reaction - he actually smiled at the drawing. This was the moment I knew I had to become a painter.

Picasso was born in 1896 and died in 1973. He was a major figure in the evolution of Cubism and Spanish art. His revolutionary use of perspective and the rejection of naturalism and the subject formed the basis of modern art.  His paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings are held in museums and private collections around the world. Picasso has been included on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.


This is an excerpt from Richard Cork's book The Painter's Purse and the story of his meeting with Pablo Picasso.


The painter’s purse is a concept that I first learnt from James Galenson, a philosopher, writer, and artist who taught at Yale and Berkeley, and was the author of several"," 

In the 1980s the great Spanish modernista began spending his winters at the village of Gordes, 20 kilometres south of Cannes, where he and his wife had a house called La Castellane. When I visited in 1988 he was standing before his celebrated Blue Period painting, Femme aux cheveux de lin (Woman with Linen Hair). As I looked up from my notebook he said ‘bonjour’ in a clear and sonorous baritone. We immediately started talking, chatting and sketching the beautiful painter until he grew impatient and, with his gnarled hands gesturing broadly, wanted me to hurry up and complete my task. Picasso’s art, the legacy of a lifetime’s work, a legacy I wish I’d understood then, but was only able to describe in my own limited way, still resonates with me.

The blue period (1902–1925) in Picasso’s art is characterised by the artist’s mastery of the use of blue. The Blue Period is characterised by the artist’s exploration of the potential of blue in his abstract colour field painting. The artist created a vast body of work between 1902 and 1925 that includes Woman with Linen Hair. The painting itself was completed in 1905, ten years before his renunciation of art, after his wife, Guinevere, persuaded him to paint again.

I was awed by his energy and commitment, which even at","

""Can I join you?"" he asked in the warm sunshine with a slice of tomato and basil piccata. I explained I'd come to paint the boats in the harbour and he suggested I try a still life. He pointed at a yacht behind me. ""I've been working on that for years. It's always bothered me how the sails look like someone is asleep on board!"" He laughed. ""You paint very well,"" he commented as I drew the vessel and then a portrait of the painter. We talked about art, boats and old age. He was very approachable, friendly and asked me to join him for a meal in the cool of the harbour cafe later that evening. When I asked him what would constitute a successful work of art, his answer was simple - whether it was appreciated by the viewer or the viewer was able to express his or her own feelings through it. The more I sketched and painted, the better I felt able to communicate with the subject, be it a boat or an old man.

""A successful work of art, whether it's appreciated by the viewer or the viewer is able to express his or her own feelings through it.""

As the days passed I started to see Picasso with a clearer eye. He had a unique way of looking at the world, his perception was unerring. He'd observe something without really looking or attending to it and, as he'd worked all his life, the observation would register immediately"," ""Ah, my good man,"" he called across, interrupting a conversation with one of his colleagues. ""I was just telling the youngster that I was the oldest painter to complete a canvas of this scale in this style in this location. And he tells me he's a 78-year-old student. Can you draw him a picture of the village? He could use a little refresher."" Picasso beamed and replied, ""Yes, of course!""  

After a few moments to compose themselves, Richard and his colleague sat down at one of the few remaining cafe tables, while Picasso took a seat nearby at the waterfront restaurant. ""What would you like to drink?"" asked Picasso. ""No, thank you, I'm fine,"" said Richard.  ""Well, you seem fairly young,"" said Picasso, studying his handiwork. ""I'm in my early 20's,"" replied Richard, nonplussed. Picasso's brow creased, ""What do you do?""  ""I'm in my last year of university studying to be an architect,"" said Richard, who had expected an instant response from the artist. ""Oh. Well I'm an artist,"" said Picasso. It did not take long for the conversation to move on from the painting of the village to talk of art and philosophy. In time Picasso asked Richard for his phone number and invited him to visit his house in the village where he showed him his paintings and his","  I saw a man of great physical strength who was working at a painting easel at a small table, with a palette and a small child sitting nearby. I took a few cautious steps towards the scene and was just about to call out that a man had entered the square of this painting company, when, without moving a single hair, Picasso turned to me and said: ""Monsieur Richard, what are you doing here?"".  The impact of this moment was so great that I fell on my knees before him and we spent half an hour talking.  Even though I was in his 80s and almost entirely blind, I found this man to be an excellent listener, who spoke without interruption throughout our entire conversation.  He spoke about his youth, his travels, about his paintings and asked me about mine. He treated me with great respect and kindness but with no trace of condescension.  A few days later I went to the museum of the company in which he was working and bought a copy of one of his masterpieces for my collection.  Many years later, in my late 80s, I made the pilgrimage to the Basque city of Bilbo, in homage to the great artist who had taken me into his circle of friendship.  What I experienced with Picasso marks a pivotal moment in my life which turned out to be a turning point for my art, my way of thinking and, indirectly, my country's cultural identity.  It also changed my"
" In short, advertisers have been trying to reach ever more complex audiences with ever more expensive media and ever less response. In a world of mass customization advertising, as it has evolved over the past century, has not kept pace with a world of customization. The consequence is that advertising has tended to get the message across to the majority rather than the individual and, while that may be enough for the majority, it isn't enough for individuals or narrow, specialized markets. 

Advertising is in trouble not because its medium is less effective but because it has become over-elaborate and over-complicated. It has become like a high school English teacher who uses 100 pages of notes to describe to her class what happened in a chapter of a novel she didn't read. 

The good news is that there is a path that avoids the pitfalls of advertising and finds a better fit between media, brands and customers. It is essentially a return to what advertising was like in the first half of the 20th century, before the rise of mass customization. It relies on old media, low tech and face to face and calls it old media because it uses print advertising, direct marketing, and outdoor advertising. 

The first step is to recognize that there is a role for high quality low tech direct marketing. It has the benefit of targeting individuals, of being low tech, and of not requiring large investments in media or the development of new product lines. It also has the drawback"," Ads are now seen by as few as 2% of the population and the even smaller number of ads which get seen are less effective than ever.

But advertising hasn't been looking for an excuse to slow down. It's just been looking for a new way to reach more people with less expenditure. Enter social media. By harnessing the power of the internet advertising can appeal to niche audiences and penetrate niche markets with less spending. It's a win-win for both advertising and customers. It's only a matter of time before social media leads to a marked reduction in advertising expenditure.

The decline in advertising has led to the emergence of a new genre of advertising: the 'less is more' campaign. The latest example is Unilever's Dial SOS. Rather than spending millions of pounds on a large media buy of billboards, buses, hoardings and other mediums of advertising it created a series of smaller, more discreet displays. The result was a dramatic increase in visibility. Admittedly some people don't like these so called 'less is more' campaigns. They see them as empty advertising and the customers they seek to reach are not interested in the products they promote. But those concerned about empty advertising should consider the arguments presented by marketing scholars Michael Porter and Alasdair Macleod in their now classic text, 'The Discipline of Global Marketing'. Porter and Macleod argue that the modern advertising medium is too complex and too expensive to"," Advertising is a powerful force but it doesn't work for everyone and it doesn't work for now.

Advertising has failed to keep pace with the pace of economic change. Advertisers prefer mass markets and mass media but their campaigns aren't tailored to individual audiences. Advertising works for some but not others.

During the late 1980s advertising was in crisis. After hitting its highs of the 1970s advertising growth decelerated in the 1980s. With the deregulation of the media, fragmentation of target markets, the proliferation of media and brands, consumers had more information than ever before but weren't spending the money to buy more of it. At the same time that advertising was losing audiences, the information and communication revolution was beginning to transform the media itself.

The decline of advertising is worldwide. Worldwide decline in advertising is a function of the fragmentation of target markets, the proliferation of media and brands, consumer information overload.

Mass markets and mass media are a good idea but in practice they rarely work. At the moment advertising works for a minority but it doesn't work for everyone.

Advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change and isn't capable of adapting fast enough to the new media environment. 

Advertising started to fall in the 1980s early in the decade. Advertising started to fall well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change and"," We can see it in our daily news with stories of protestors in the Arab world protesting against the negative effects of advertising.

And the story continues:

But advertising is changing. With the advent of social media and video, we are seeing a shift toward message and experience delivery. Brands have realized that they can no longer afford to ignore the ""little guy"". The little guy may not be a household name or a huge billboard but every one of us can potentially be an influencer and an advocate. The future is all about leveraging this platform to create more effective and relevant advertising that actually touches the heart.

The Flesch Kincaid Grade scale, designed by Robert C. Wiredu, is a scale for measuring written English difficulty. The scale has five categories ranging from Level 0 (most difficult) to Level 5 (least difficult). The text given above falls into Level 3, or ""somewhat difficult"".

Level 3, or ""somewhat difficult"", corresponds to a text that is neither too simple nor too complex.

Level 3 text contains some but not a lot of complexity, with relatively easy sentence construction and an easy to read style.

"," Advertisers expect mass media to deliver consistent results regardless of the medium's merits so instead of engaging in high profile advertising campaigns that drive targeted media audiences into a frenzy advertisers prefer to focus on the evergreen and buy into the mantra: there is an advertisement for everything! The result is a huge increase in advertising but also an increase in non-consensual exposure to advertisements and the erosion of standards of taste. In summary advertising is in the doldrums and it is here to stay.


While this may be true, there are some industries that have been more adept at mass-marketing their goods and services and are more resistant to the erosion of standards of taste. The automotive industry, for instance, has continued to rely on mass marketing with advertising techniques that have remained consistent over the years, namely: 1) targeting key demographics using mass-medium like television (that will remain largely untouched by the internet); and 2) buying into the mantra: there is an automobile for everyone!


In summary, mass marketing as a concept is not dead and as long as the automotive industry continues to rely on targeting key demographics through mass mediums such as television, advertising will likely survive.


I hope this helps.


-Dmitri


I can imagine the automotive industry continues to rely on mass marketing with advertising techniques that have remained consistent over the years, namely: 1) targeting key demographics using mass-medium like television (that will remain largely"," The reality is that the average American sees only a handful of ads each year. So many channels compete for consumer attention. The media environment has become so dense and varied that consumers need more help sifting through it all. Advertising has become irrelevant. Advertisers have redefined their goals to be more about influencing behavior and less about trying to sell things. They are learning to be more subtle about their messages and are spending more on earned media. Even the tried and true techniques of advertising, like sponsorships, are now questioned because they are believed to be only effective on a limited scale.


Advertising isn't just irrelevant, it's a miss. Advertising's problems are more fundamental. Advertising started to plunge early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertisers like to think in terms of mass markets and mass media but as brands and media have proliferated target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences but they rarely are. The reality is that the average American sees only a handful of ads each year. So many channels compete for consumer attention. The media environment has become so dense and varied that consumers need more help sifting through it all. Advertising has become irrelevant. Advertising is a miss. Advertising has become irrelevant. Advertising isn't just"," Advertising is now seen as a luxury by many businesses with its high overheads. Advertising has become too expensive. It relies too heavily on traditional mass media, television, billboards, print and radio and as these have become saturated they have become prohibitively expensive. What was once seen as an opportunity for profit has become a curse. Advertising has been described as 'Hit and miss, try again, same ad, new target'. It has not kept up with modern communications technology and has become a barrier to economic and social progress. It is certainly a barrier to creativity. A new advertising paradigm is required that puts the consumer at the heart of everything it does. A true paradigm shift will require new advertising media. New technology is offering the potential for a whole new approach that will be faster, more efficient and more effective. The Internet is offering us the chance to connect to other individuals through a virtual social space but also offer consumer choice in what we see and how we see it. Virtual communities offer the chance for advertisers to create a true one to one relationship with target consumers. These individuals will not only share the advertising with friends but also generate their own content and build a profile of themselves. Advertising used to be about one thing and one thing only the product or service and the advertiser would hold the consumer's hand as they traversed aisles of a store or went on a supermarket shopping spree. No more. Advertising is now about a unique experience for the consumer."
" A phone was for making occasional dolly-medley contact with friends; email had not been dreamt up by Congress. I had barely even heard of podcasts, let alone how to make one. So it was with excitement that I found myself on a train to the Royal Mail's HQ in Chiswick, London, just a few miles from my home in West London. I had been tasked with producing a podcast for Royal Mail which would help promote its service and raise money for the charity Combat Stress. I needed to record my thoughts and opinions on the issues of the day in a manner that would be both engaging and engaging. I knew my limitations and decided that if I was to succeed, I would need to enlist the help of my new-found teenage daughter, Georgina. She was, after all, an ideal conduit through which my audience could hear my thoughts and opinions, while I could guide them through the process of transcribing my thoughts onto the small device in my hand. So we set about learning as much as we could about the art of interviewing. Georgina was soon busy typing and uploading her thoughts onto the Royal Mail website. I, meanwhile, sat and observed, occasionally asking her a question if my thoughts proved impenetrable to her. I was soon in awe of Georgina's skills at transcription and quickly discovered that she would happily guide me through a process that could easily have tested the mettle of a top news reporter. We had our first interview"," The only real hi-tech devices I owned were the television and the VCR. My office would have looked to the owners of the modern day equivalent of a typewriter as their fathers would have felt they had arrived.

So I decided to get rid of the 1970s furniture that was taking up so much space - the space I believed that only journalists occupied. The first step was to find a suitable replacement for my ageing Ikea desk, as they had gone out of business and were no longer available. The second step was to install free standing whiteboards in various locations throughout the house. The third step was to order a complete office fit-out and set about installing a computer system, a printer, a fax machine and a telephone. I contacted a company that specialises in these types of projects and was delighted to find that they were able to complete the project within my specified timescale. The end result was a comfortable office which would enable me to resume my long lost career in journalism. The moral of this story would be to take a long term view of things - the end is almost always in sight if you are willing to accept the discomfort of a career break and the necessary adjustments to make in the short term.


The story continues for Grade 2 learners:


The following month I had turned 38 - and realised it was time to upgrade to a more efficient work system. My old whiteboards were too slow and the size of the room didn't allow me to fit"," Then I saw an ad for a lease sale of an A2 unit at a media company - a division of a conglomerate best known for its energy drinks - which I had never heard of, so I took the plunge. 
My first task was to replace the ancient fax machine in the basement with a modern model, which, having recently acquired an iPhone had finally arrived. The fax machine is a symbol of the past that was still being used. Next I hired a qualified electrician to install an UPS, then I set about rewiring the house to facilitate plugging in all the electronic devices the company would require. The house has two electric plugs, both on the main entrance hall. My plan was to create one group for the phones, TVs and other electronics that the company might require, with the remaining one for charging phones and other items. 

With the electrical work done I set about replacing the fax machine and installing a modern one that would be more efficient. I was thrilled to find a model that was compact, sleek and would work from the back of the sofa, a challenge given that the sofa was the largest piece of furniture in the large reception room. I also bought a wireless broadband router for internet access to enable use of the company laptop - which I had to borrow - as well as a number of mobile phones and tablets, all of which had to be charged. I also bought an in-house computer monitor, which I had to dismantle and transport"," 
My journey began a few months ago when my brother and his family decided to buy the house we grew up in. He has done the vast majority of the work on the restoration and renovation - stripping back the clutter, upgrading the equipment, cleaning up the garden, reinstating the family room. The restoration work is now complete and the house is fully operational as my workplace. As soon as my brother and his wife arrived I was on the case, cleaning the kitchen, sorting the recycling, sorting the papers, running the vacuum cleaner, uncluttering the hallway. It felt like a labour of love and something I should be doing. We have a large computer with a wide range of specialist software that will allow me to be fully immersed in my work and continue my training to the highest professional standards in the world-class digital journalism programme at New York University. I feel completely at home here. 

Christmas is such a wonderful time of the year. I can spend it relaxing with family, eating delicious food and enjoying the company of friends. The McGuiness family are wonderful and the warmth and kindness has made my return to the workplace more enjoyable than I thought it would be possible. 

In summary, I was able to re-enter the digital journalism workforce through the restoration of my childhood home. The restoration work provides not just the space and equipment needed to work, but the opportunity to embrace the technological advances of the digital age. Restoration work like this is now opening"," 

So how did I pull this off? As always with the home made efforts I needed a plan. My plan was simple: a standing desk. 

First of all a standing desk needs a solid base. So the flooring was ripped up and the area beneath the desk carpeted. Then I needed some way of lowering myself to a height at which I could stand without hurting my back. My solution was a pair of step stools.

Having stepped this up a level I then needed to be able to see everything that was going on around me. Fortunately there is a gap in the skirting board that allowed me to install a desk CCTV camera to give me the perfect 360 degree view. 

Finally I needed something to write with. This needed to be in a place that I could see without being in your face. I then chose to install a small desk on a bookcase in the sitting area of the study so that I could keep an eye on all the screens at once without being distracted from my work.

Next came the design – a big desk is good, a small desk is better but a super small desk is the best of both worlds. A super small desk is best defined by a small working surface and a high top sitting surface so that one can comfortably reach overhead and at eye level without compromising one's field of view.

Lastly the hardware. My desk was going to need the following items. A large flat screen for TV"," To be fair, typewriters still existed and were widely used by governments, armed forces, companies and charities to send and receive messages. I therefore did my research, visited the home-ware store and selected the latest technology - a Samsung fridge freezer, Apple iPad, Amazon Echo, Google Home Mini, Microsoft Surface Pro, Microsoft Office 365, Apple Watch - all of which, bar the Apple Watch, I bought. The kitchen, bathroom, lounge and garden had to be emptied of all items that weren't going to be used, disposed of properly and put back afterwards, as well as removing all the junk mail from the previous decade from the so-called filing cabinet. The process took a couple of days. I had to make the kitchen, bathroom, lounge and garden ready for modern living. To avoid a disaster on the first day, I had the freezer loaded on the first day and had the fridge emptied and ready by the afternoon. I would load the freezer in the morning before leaving for work, drive to the local supermarket and pick up the items needed to get through the next day. On the first day, I made a few changes to the pantry and the garden shed, in case something went wrong or needed to be stored. That first day, I made the kitchen appear to be completely empty. The fridge was hidden from view in the garage. There was nothing to see, but I had managed to dispose of the vast majority of the clutter from the previous decade."," So, rather than spend another Christmas in the kitchen baking and cooking for my in-laws, I decided to go the ""web-side"" and transform our home into a modern, efficient workspace. By using technology to automate things that were done manually, I could not only save time, but ensure that things were done more consistently. The first area to look at was our paper work. My predecessor had neglected to staple all the documents together and to ensure that they didn't get missed or lost I used a program called Evernote to automatically bookmark all relevant documents into a secure online account. I also took the initiative to use email rather than physical paper letters. It took a little bit of getting used to, but I did learn that I could actually save time by not writing or addressing a physical paper letter and simply using an email attachment to transmit the relevant information. In the end it came down to automating the things that were manual such as taking photos of our document and sending them to our professional. I was able to procure a Raspberry Pi, which let's you connect to a WiFi network and is basically a mini PC that allows for remote access. Using the Raspberry Pi I installed a program called ""Pixs"" which enables you to take photos remotely from your mobile or tablet. I then programmed Pixs to download all of the photos taken around the house by the professional and place them in our secure online account. So what did I do? I made it so that when"

They have fitted one of their hens with a tracking device and another with a camera, then set the peacocks loose in Whipsnade to find out how the train is carried aloft. The researchers will use the data from the hen with the camera to compare it with the GPS coordinates of the peacock’s nest, at which point they intend to take the nest away and put the peacocks back in the wild, though not before the scientists have been able to film the event from their car. In the meantime they continue to track the train on the hen’s beak and monitor its progress in the peacocks’ specially designed nest - a mobile platform that uses tree branches lashed together, and with a hole cut into it large enough to enable the train to pull itself through.


Whipsnade is well known as the home of the ""Battleship"" HMS Warrior, and is often referred to as the most beautiful park in the world. It offers various kinds of amusement for all ages, including: a museum dedicated to the life and work of Charles Darwin; a petting zoo with lions, zebras, giraffes and monkeys; a fun fair; a farm and two lakes for boating, swimming, paddling and sailing.  At night, it hosts a full-moon boat party on the lake and an ice-cream picnic on the lawn.


The peacocks roam free"," The team have started with one of the largest and most impressive of peacock’s trains, and in a few months time will start filming the others for the Channel 4 series Birds Big Broadband. As they say, nature red in tooth and claw.  

* * *

 The peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues of the Open University are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try a century after Darwin’s death to try to settle the matter. The team have started with one of the largest and most impressive of peacock’s trains, and in a few months time will start filming the others for the Channel 4 series Birds Big Broadband. 

The peacocks, are a family of birds called Tyrannidae and are large, beautiful and flashy. The males have striking black and orange plumage, while females have more subdued colouring. 

The research team are observing and following the peacocks and will capture high definition video footage of their trains which are 15ft long with beautiful feathers and tail.  The train has been designed to mimic the natural appearance of a Tyrannidae bird.  

To date, the Channel 4 series has had a million viewers with many viewers voting and signing up to see the next episode","  

The researchers have re-created the harsh environment of the Galápagos Islands with free-ranging peacocks at Whipsnade.  They are then taking the birds on a six-month expedition to the Caribbean to observe how the tropical climate affects their migratory habits.  By then they hope to have learnt the answer to this intriguing question. And should the results support Darwin’s theory that peacocks evolved this extravagance to outcompete their cousins the turkeys for the limited supplies of train carriages that will one day grace the wedding train of Charles and Fanny Darwin, they will have done a small but valuable service to science.


The scientists hope to create their own “wedding train” at Whipsnade with the re-created peacock exhibit, the help of Charles Darwin’s private carriage and a selection of the zoo’s resident peacocks.


The peacocks are being trained to perform a spectacular night-time fly-past for the public, and their mating behaviour has also been studied to further our understanding of what drives the birds’ behaviour.  The research team is led by biologist Dr Marion Petrie, and includes zoologist Martin Richards and Dr Steve Jones from the University of Sheffield.


Dr Petrie and her colleagues will return to Whipsnade in September 2011 at the end of the six-month expedition to the Caribbean, where they hope to witness the re-emerg"," She, along with others, is using GPS to follow the birds’ daily migration routes to their “power dressing” points, where they must don their showiest feathers, and using satellite imagery to work out where each bird has been over the past month, plotting their movements on a map. Their conclusion? Like many other ornithologists, the peacocks and their friends the fantails, “the king of the finches”, the gulls and starlings, they don’t just dress to impress, but they literally dress to win. They eat only when full and, to preserve their feathers and muscle, they take long, cool showers - even in the middle of summer. If they’re going to do it, they think, they might as well do it right. The answer, they conclude, is that it isn’t about survival of the fittest, as Darwin would have it, but survival of the fittest dressed to impress, that is the peacock equivalent of flash.

"," They argue that although the peacocks may spend their summer days strutting their stuff for the assembled crowds, the hens are actually better off without their extravagant displays of feathers and fancy footwork. For the hens, it is not about beauty, it is about survival and, if the zoologists are to be believed, this may just be the closest that Darwin got to an actual example of natural selection in action.


Symbiosis is a complex relationship between two or more organisms that do not occupy the same level in the biological evolutionary pyramid. Examples of symbioses include humans and bacteria, plants and fungi, and bees and wax moth.


Peacocks are birds, and they are not mammals. They are birds. The peacocks of Whipsnade are birds. They are also not mammals. They are birds.


However, they spend their summers strutting their stuff for the assembled crowds. They do it every summer.


The peacocks spend their summers strutting their stuff for the assembled crowds. They do it every summer. They do it because it is what they do.

The first sentence in the narrative is longer than the average Flesch-Kincaid Grade, although it is not obvious from this sentence alone. After considering the Flesch-Kincaid and another English metric, the Gunning-Fog Index, the shorter version is: 
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale looks at total words, total sentences, and total syllables in a text. The Gunning-Fog Index looks at the characters in a word, the number of syllables in a word, and the ratio of characters to syllables.  

The total number of words in the first sentence of the narrative is 56:  56 words / 7 sentences / 12 sentences / 7 syllables = 56 total words. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade is then 7.3. 

The first sentence in the narrative contains 57 characters, which is above the median of 50 characters. The number of syllables in the first sentence is 11, which is above the median of 9 syllables. And the word ratio of characters to syllables is 10.2:1, which is above the median of 3.7:1. 

"," By wearing specially adapted suits which harness the power of a steam engine they are trying to breed peacocks with genetically altered genes that will disable their wings and make them the world’s smallest and most agile flying animals. As the scientists take their experimental birds out for the day the hen peacocks don their red, gold and green robes and go to lunch - only to realise as the hen peacocks return that their birds have been rendered flightless. Petrie and her colleagues - who run the Animal Liberation Front’s first-ever power-assisted peacock - say they are trying to make the smallest, fastest birds on earth and are using DNA editing to ensure that these birds’ wings won’t function. But she is also warning that they could be doing more harm than good. She says that, far from making the world’s smallest and quickest birds, the power-assisted peacocks would be indistinguishable from the real thing - or at least from the real thing as seen from Whipsnade: the real peacocks, she explains, are enormous birds and those at Whipsnade would be even larger because the wild peacocks, when not breeding, would be on the move.

" How can we explain our human uniqueness? We think we have unique skills (looked at as a source of natural talents) - but is it possible that they might be genetic? It would certainly make sense from an evolutionary perspective - as it would allow us to invest more in what we do, and so be better able to adapt to changing environments. From a human perspective, genetic differences between humans would mean that we are each able to perform a particular skill set a little better than others. The advantages that come from being able to do something a little better might be very big indeed. For example, imagine if, as an artist you spent three to four months of each year travelling to a few key markets to develop relationships and perform your art, which meant you were able to do this on a much smaller budget than other artists could access. Or imagine, if you had a rare genetic ability to produce the precise colour and shade of red that would appeal to a client. If you are an athlete and can train hard three to four times a week, then your genetic potential to increase your athleticism could mean that you are able to go further and faster in your preferred sports. There is a risk that the advantages conferred by genetic differences between humans could be very limited, and so we want to consider the opposite. A genetic argument for our uniqueness might be that we are able to perform our natural talents - perhaps a little better - due to a tiny fraction of our genes. One way to assess this is"," But that’s what it seems like has happened. We’re the only living species to have managed to develop so much art. What’s remarkable is that art is relatively straightforward. It’s not as if humans invented the wheel or gunpowder and needed to get our heads around concepts of weight and force. We have a hard-wired ability to make abstract images. That’s an enormous advantage in an age when it’s becoming harder and harder to communicate with only what we perceive as hard-wired non-verbal communication. Art, like science, is a form of communication. A scientist might, for example, spend hours in a lab making a perfect, precise measurement. The scientist then communicates that precise measurement to someone else. What we have to recognise is that any communication has to be interpreted, which means we have to be able to decipher what the other person is trying to communicate. It’s the same with art. What we have to recognise is that there is no absolute meaning to art. Anyone looking at a Picasso will see something different to anyone looking at a carving by an Egyptian. And Picasso might be trying to communicate something different to the carvings of Egyptian pharaohs. What we’ve got is a creative innate ability which anyone can study and which anyone can understand. There’s no need to assume that art is special or mystical. It’s just another skill. Like any other skill we can","  

That’s why, so far at least, it looks like human exceptionalism is a myth. When the genetic evidence for our uniquely human status is weighed against the enormous quantity of shared genes between humans and chimps the conclusion is inescapable that we have just a tiny fraction of the genetic material needed to account for our unique status. 

This doesn’t mean we humans are not special. There is still more to us than chimps in terms of our social lives and cultures. There are many reasons why a chimpanzee would never consider painting or other creative pursuits to be viable options for a human. But what it does suggest is we shouldn’t look down our noses at all other mammals – chimps included – for their natural talents. We should recognise that the human gene pool has some advantages. These might include a bigger brain, a better sense of humour, greater artistic ability or just the knack of looking after ourselves. 

NATURAL TALENTS The best of all natural talents may be that of the child prodigy, with their lightning speed, prodigious memory, original ideas and talent for impressing their elders. The best examples of such prodigies exist in every culture and across all time periods and geography. The musical geniuses of Bach, Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Wagner are all but guaranteed to be amongst the most gifted musicians of all time. 

So why don’t we hear more of these"," The obvious explanation is that the trait has evolved in recent times. If so, what are the characteristics of this exceptional human talent? Our unique talent in this area is probably our extraordinary capacity to control our senses and focus our attention to single objects, allowing us to ignore distractions and complete tasks efficiently, whether that means using our eyesight to detect and capture a rare bird’s egg in flight or holding our attention on a single detail on a black and white photograph for thirty seconds. The trait has also led us to create and appreciate art, an ability also unique to humans. We’ve created the paintings in the Louvre and the Mozart symphonies - and Mozart had no special talent. However we can attribute this extraordinary human talent to our close relative the chimpanzee, who some believe was the first artist. Chimps are also the closest living relative to humans of the ape family whose members made stone tools. We can therefore conclude that our capacity to be creative and artistic was honed by our close primate relatives by fine-tuning our senses to the particular demands of creative expression. 

The text begins with a reference to the ""distantly related"" ape family and ends with the attribution of the art trait to the ""closest living relative"" of humans, the chimp. The text is not descriptive enough to allow students to draw their own conclusions regarding the authors' premise, nor is it specific enough to ensure that students can use"," Yet this is the position that evolutionary psychology (which I believe we need to understand what human nature really is, in all its complexity and diversity) suggests our brains were specifically created for. So what are our natural talents? We can make art.


What are our natural talents? We can make art.


This statement is supported by a strong argument based on evolutionary psychology. Our physical capacity for making art (whatever changes were needed in the human physique brain and sense organs) and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes. That's a large burden to place on a relative handful of genes. Yet this is the position that evolutionary psychology suggests our brains were specifically created for. Our natural talents must lie in the small fraction of our genes responsible for our distinctive physical capacity for making art.


This is an impressive argument based on the premise that our brains were specifically created for art. To fully evaluate the argument we need to understand what our evolutionary ancestors were like, what the challenges facing our ancestors were, and how our unique physical capacity for making art contributed to our ancestors’ survival. This can be difficult to ascertain since we do not have direct evidence of our evolutionary ancestors, but based on archaeological evidence, we can speculate on their behaviour.

Evolutionary psychologists suggest that humans have distinctive physical traits specifically designed for the arts. Chimpanzees, on the other hand, tend to be more aggressive and are primarily hunters."," However, it must be remembered that it’s not an impossible proposition that only a single gene (or a very few of them) has been selected for its contribution to our exceptional capacity for art, science, music, poetry and whatever else we think is human.


Genetically, humans are 98 per cent identical to chimps. But art, science, music, poetry, and whatever else we think is human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes. That's a large burden to place on a relative handful of genes.

That’s one of the reasons why the debate around 'artificial creativity' (which the media and politicians often use as if it was a debate) doesn't interest me. I’m not sure what exactly we should be worried about when machines are capable of generating human-like creative ideas. Artificial creativity is here to stay, so perhaps we should embrace it. Creativity and innovation are the lifeblood of a society and technology is here to help us find solutions to our challenges. Artificial creativity has already helped to find new solutions to problems that plagued humanity in the past.  This article aims to outline the arguments against and for artificial creativity.

What is Artificial Creativity?

Artificial creativity is the ability of machines to generate creative ideas and solve complex problems that humans are unable to accomplish. Artificial creativity is already a fact and we're very good at finding new creative solutions to problems that humans have struggled with. Artificial creativity can be defined as any innovative solution that would otherwise be impossible for humans to imagine or achieve. Artificial creativity has aided our society in the past and it will continue to help us in the future.


Arguments against artificial creativity:

Machines are still very much constrained by the laws of physics and chemistry which limits their ability to think like humans. These laws are very complex, but if a machine were able to breach these laws and think ‘outside the box’ then there is a risk that machines could generate"

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bonnington was employed as a geologist by the British Geological Survey. During this period he wrote several technical papers on the geology of Greenland. Between 1985 and 1989, he set about climbing all the ice and rock mountains that were within 1,500 kilometres of where he lived in southwest England. He began with the highest mountains to provide a broad survey of their character and terrain. His route planning was inspired by the pioneering rock climbers who had used the Khumbu Glacier as a safe path to the south. He based his approach on the scientific method of ""prospection."" He would spend several weeks in base camp preparing the route and then spend several weeks in the mountains reaching the summit. He was accompanied in the mountains by a Sherpa and a support team of porters and yaks. He considered it an honour to have made the first summit of each mountain. 

One of his favourite mountains was Kangchenjunga. The route to its summit requires high-altitude traverses across ungroomed ice surfaces. He and his team often came across large boulders that were frozen in position. Bonnington felt that the large boulders were the most enjoyable feature of the mountain. In addition, the mountain boasts a huge crevasse on its southeast ridge. When the ice caves became inaccessible due to heavy snowfall, Bonnington would try to climb inside the"," Robin and Chris met whilst he was leading the ascent of Everest in 1986, climbing in the Northolt Climbing Team. This is when Robin first met Chris. The pair set out for the North Pole in 1988 via the Northwest Passage in a Russian ice transport ship named ""Arktika"" where Chris acted as Ship's Doctor, setting up specialist clinics for the voyage. Arktika survived Iceberg perilous passages and after a two-week ordeal returned to civilization. Chris' reputation as a rock and ice mountaineer was forged during this crossing. In 1990, they climbed the Eiger, Wetterhorn, Zugspitze and Jungfrau with a guide and porter, who had previously accompanied Chris on his solo ascent of the Eiger's North face. In 1994 they joined Chris' ex-wife and two children on the trip to the South Pole in a converted World Airways Boeing 727. Despite a serious air crash on approach that killed 14 people, including their 10-year-old daughter, they all safely reached the South Pole. In 1996 they climbed the Eiger again with a new team and guide. In 2003, their adventures brought them to the attention of the worldwide media with the filming of a documentary ""From Sea to Sound"" which aired on the BBC in 2005. Chris and Robin made their triumphant return from the North and South Pole in 2006 in a converted World Airways Boeing 727.

They are now working together again to return to complete the circumnavigation.  


Sea Ice and Rock tells the story of two friends who, after years of failed attempts, are finally able to make it to Greenland and successfully complete the circumnavigation of the world by sailing and climbing.  The duo were challenged by the inhospitable weather of Greenland, but the challenges they faced inspired the story and gave them a greater appreciation for the challenges they faced when they first started out in life.  Bonnington and Knox-Johnston's adventure is a tale of hope, passion, courage and overcoming the challenges of life to achieve incredible feats.


Sea Ice and Rock starts with the duo on their voyage from London to the Lizard Islands. As the two make their way across the North Sea they pass icebergs that form in early summer when the Arctic sea ice melts. In the story, Bonnington reflects on the challenges he faced on his first attempt at scaling Mount Everest in 1985, and reminds Knox-Johnston of the trans-Atlantic record he set in his solo yacht sail around the world. After a quick pit stop in the Netherlands, the pair make it to the Lizard. There they set about trying to raise sufficient funds to complete the circumnavigation. Bonning","

" The route was well trodden by other feet and those who had never set foot on the island were surprised to find they could climb. By late afternoon they reached the top. 'This is quite lovely,' said Lenina 'we are alone on this island and I can see we are miles from the shore. I wish there was a boat so I could swim across.' 'I wish we could bring the plane too,' said Toto. 'It is much faster than walking. You are looking at the most fantastic sunset,' Lenina continued looking over to the west. 'Oh look, the colours are so bright. I don't think I have ever seen so much light.' 'I think we might just make it,' said Toto. 'Let's go.'  They walked back into the dry channel and turned the corner the drums were beating so loud. The drummers stopped and looked at Toto and Lenina they didn't understand. What do you think you are doing here.' the drummers said in chorus. 'We are going for a swim.' 'But the current is so strong here. You will drown.' 'We don't care, it is so nice in the water.' 'We shall return another day, when we have retrieved the plane.' Toto and Lenina kept walking up the hill and the drummers could see that the children were having fun and that made the drummers sad. 'Why do you stay here then. Go away'. 'Are you"," Suddenly Lenina felt a shiver down her back and knew they were at the top.'It's too windy out here' she said looking back at the way they had come. 'We might get caught in the wind up here' said Peter trying to keep a steady pace. 'We could go back down' said Lenina. Peter looked up and there was a ledge a few feet above them. 'There's no way down' he said 'look for another way down'. They found another ledge and climbed that. They found another ledge and another. After 10 minutes they stopped at the last ledge and looked up at the top of the hill. It was now a great height above them. 'How high is this hill?' asked Lenina

The story then continues with the discovery of a cave at the top of the hill which contained strange decorations and a pool of water which they thought looked very much like wine. From there the explorers returned to the city.

The moral of the story is that although it may be harder to do things, it is often worth it in the end. By hardening our hearts and doing the difficult things, we can often discover blessings along the way.

Finally they reached the top. Lenina turned to look at Rex, there was a grin on her face.  
'How do you feel?' asked Lenina.
'Very very nice', said Rex.

The above text was taken from an article about the search for the Avianca aircraft by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

"," Occasionally the watercourse would part company with the rock and they would find themselves in a dry channel. Here the path followed a straight line and the going was easier.

The rock wall changed slightly and they climbed a little higher but now they could see that the path was ending not only at the top but also sloping down into a lake. They climbed down into the depths and walked along the shoreline for a time. The path was not visible and their footsteps only sank into the sand a few centimetres apart. They decided to look around and search for the path that they had heard earlier.

At first, the only sounds that they could hear were the waves crashing onto the shore and the trickle of water flowing from the hill to the lake. They stood for a time taking in the stunning view. They could see across the valley to the hills on the other side of the lake. On the far side of the lake was a small lake that was frozen over except for the tip where the ice was only just beginning to break up. There were trees on the other side of the valley and Lenina was trying to find a way to see them and so she pointed the way out of the valley to the hills on the other side.

She was pointing at the clouds.

'Those are the mountains. And those are the hills,' she pointed at the hills on the other side of the lake. 'When you look across the valley they look like"," When the path forked Lenina looked to the right hand path but there was only blackness. She turned the corner and the drums were pounding. 'Wow', said Lenina, 'that was a bit scary and really hard going, I'm glad we came along.' They continued and soon emerged at the other side. 'I wonder what's down there?' said Lenina, 'I'm really tired now, we've had an interesting journey haven't we?'

'Yes, but at least now you've seen it', said Mr C and gave her an affectionate hug. 'That's the best thing about the journey. You see the world differently. You see the beauty.' 'Yes, but what if we get lost?', said Lenina. 'If we get lost that will really test our faith, won't it?' Lenina thought for a moment and replied, 'I suppose so, but if we don't go on a journey we will never know the wonders of the world.'

Lenina and Mr C travelled down the path, and arrived at a large rock wall. Above them was a cave mouth. They walked through the darkness into the darkness into the cave. When Lenina looked up she gasped, 'What is that?' Lenina and Mr C shone their torches into the hole. The hole was not visible from the entrance, only when they were inside could they see the faint glow. They looked down at the light and shivered."," At other times they marched steadily along. Suddenly at the top of the path there was a great shout of 'Hooray! We have made it! We have made it!' and they tumbled over each other in the joy of their success. 'And now for the difficult bit' said Lenina. They tried their hardest not to make any noise. The path had gone from side to side again. There seemed to be no order at all to its direction. They were just in its way trying to get about their business of scaling the rock. The path became more narrow. They could barely pass each other. Finally Lenina said 'Oh help us now.' And she said 'Give me a minute to catch my breath.' She looked down with relief. The path was still there. They had made it up. They were out of the valley and on their way to the village. 'That was close though wasn't it.' Lenina said as she put a finger to her lip. 'But we did it.' And they both went to examine the path carefully. At the bottom where the water had worn away a pathway was clear. 

Now the interesting bit. Lenina said to herself 'That is really quite funny. A minute ago we were nearly there and now we can't even see the bottom.' So she returned to the bottom of the rock and led the way up. 'I think I know what happened here. Some kind of dry channel was carved through the rock"," Lenina thought they'd have to stop several times but then they'd only walk part way up so as to go backwards and try again. When they got to the top they found that there was a small waterfall in a deep pool and a bench by a little pool. 'Oh how I love the waterfall. I could drink its water and swim in its deep pool. We must return now as it gets late and the plane will not wait. I wonder what else we could do in this beautiful area. It would be so nice to have children of our own to show it to.' 'We could get married' said Felix. 'We'd have our own little piece of Earth to call our own.' 'You say the sweetest things' said Lenina as they kissed. 'But we're not having children.' 'We must make the most of what we have' said Felix. 'I think you are right.' 'But what about us?' 'I think you should travel to other worlds to see what else there is to see, to experience.' 'I don't know if I can manage that' said Lenina. 'I'm not sure either but I think we should explore all possibilities as long as we are still alive.'

In the Middle Ages people chewed an herbal combination called Bazeley. Chewing gum was not restricted to the elite and everyone chewed in an era that was famously classless. People chewed their way through the American Civil War.  Chewing gum was popular at the time of the Civil War and both North and South were using it to remember key moments. Chewing gum was also common during Prohibition when people chewed tobacco to dull the harsh tastes of alcohol.  Chewing gum became very popular in the 1920s and 1930s leading to the phrase “the great gumming debacle.” During the Great Depression chewing gum helped Americans forget about their troubles for a while.  Chewing gum was so popular that by the mid-1930s the U.S. government had to limit the sale of gum in pharmacies, drugstores, and grocery stores. The modern convenience of chewing gum has led to a resurgence in popularity but this time it is not only the elite who are chewing. During World War II Americans also chewed gum to help with fatigue.

Chewing gum is a natural way to strengthen the"," These chewing gum trits were the precursors of modern chewing gum which we know and love today. But why did chewing gum become so popular? Modern research suggests it was initially an aid for swallowing saliva during lectures and dinners. This was a necessary method for the consumption of solid foods as the mastic tree would not grow in the colder regions of Greece. Then it travelled with the Roman armies and colonists to many far off places such as North Africa and India. By the time of the Renaissance, mastic was a popular choice for flavoured waters. Mastic water containing herbs and flowers was sold in taverns and even the Pope had a flavoured water made with mastic. When the Protestant Reformation broke out in Europe, mastic water was an ideal way of quenching the thirst of the faithful. Mastic water containing the Roman Catholic dogmas made it the perfect water to douse the heretics of the Netherlands. Finally, mastic water was even used to baptise babies. The chewing of mastic became a social custom with no meaning beyond personal pleasure. Today, chewing gum is the world’s most widely traded food product valued at over $75 billion annually.

Chewing gum is very fashionable, but there are those who think it is more important to adhere to rules than to taste good.


Today’s chewing gum is largely synthetic with added pine resins and softeners which help to hold the flavour and improve the texture


Mastic tree bark"," Mastic was used to treat mouth sores and sore throats and also as a toothpaste. It was not chewed but rather pulverized and mixed with honey to sweeten. It contains about 12 calories and is considered to be the world’s most expensive sugar. Despite its calorific content, mastic was also claimed to have a number of health benefits including a strengthening of the teeth and gums, to prevent cavities. In 1496, after years of military campaigns in Italy, the army of Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman empire invaded Greece and the following year, 1497, Venice became the first European country to accept Ottoman merchandise. The Ottoman Empire became a powerful trading partner of Venice. This led to the beginning of the worldwide use of mastic in chewing gum. By the mid-19th century, chewing gum had become a cultural feature of the United States. Gum became a way to show you were not too refined.  There was even a period when many women chewed gum to keep their voices clear.  Today, chewing gum is still considered to be a sign of youthfulness among many American adults.  In the UK it is also considered a good anti-ageing measure. Today, mastic is extracted from the tree either by steaming the bark or by crushing it and soaking the crushed bark in alcohol. Mastic contains about 14 calories per gram and about 70% water.  The other 30% are sugars including dulcit"," During Roman times, mastic was traded for gold and frankincense. Mastic was also one of the first foods to be mass-produced by the Italian city of Modena in the 1500s. 

Ancient Romans also chewed resin from the mastic tree to boost their mood and mental performance, a practice still practised by many Italians today. The use of mastic continued to increase in popularity in the 18th century with British colonists in America, who imported mastic to flavor their cheese curds and biscuits. Today, mastic is also one of the ingredients in some over-the-counter cold remedies. Mastic is also used in many cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. 

However, despite it’s popularity, mastic was not formally classified as a food by the FDA until 1964. It was only in 1988 that mastic-flavoured chewing gum became available on prescription in the United States to treat symptoms associated with stress and anxiety. Despite it’s high calibre ingredients, mastic-flavoured chewing gum does contain a small amount of artificial coloring which is a banned additive in foods for human consumption by Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union. 

In 2009 the FDA approved mastic gum for use in a new category of products: dietary supplements. It is unclear why the agency waited nearly 30 years to formally include mastic in the list of foods. Nevertheless, there are still no guarantees that mastic-"," The Romans followed and they chewed cassia, a gum obtained from the seeds of a plant in India. The practice continued in England where it was known as snuff and even into the 17th century. Chewing gum was forbidden by the Temperance Movement which wanted to reduce the prevalence of alcohol. The first mention of chewing gum can be found in the 19th century and it eventually became quite popular as it served as a way of avoiding important discussions and giving the appearance of being informed. In the 1920s, American chewing gum manufacturer Reese’s created a national advertising campaign featuring young girl endorsing Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. 
After World War II chewing gum returned to fashion and as of 2015 Americans were still chewing 12 million sticks a day. Because chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick it is considered a low calorie food and therefore does not have to adhere to the safety standards of the FDA.

"," They chewed this for hundreds of years before switching to a synthetic product. Chewing gum is frowned upon by doctors and other medical professionals because there is evidence that it can cause cavities.

The author makes the unusual choice of talking about chewing gum twice. First, he introduces the chewing of a resin “exclusively obtained from the bark of the mastic tree”, as though chewing gum were exotic. Second, he notes that chewing gum was present in ancient Greece “Hundreds of years before the introduction of the synthetic product”, implying that chewing gum has been with us for a very long time. Both claims are incorrect. Mastic trees are common and grow in the Mediterranean region, particularly in Turkey. Their resin is chewed by Turks but is not unusual in Greece. There is no evidence that chewing gum for hundreds of years was the rule in Greece rather than the exception.

"," When the Romans invaded Greece they brought their chewing gum habit with them. The Romans also believed chewing gum helped to strengthen teeth and prevented tooth decay. In the early Middle Ages chewing gum fell out of fashion and by the 13th century it was thought to cause flatulence. In 1555 the Portuguese introduced it to Brazil where it made a comeback. This was after the Europeans returned from the 1588 voyage of Vasco de Gama, the first non-Indian to reach South East Asia by sea route. The Portuguese brought with them the knowledge of how to grow mastic trees and with them, the Brazilians adopted chewing their favourite gum once more. Today it’s estimated that over 200 million Brazilians still chew gum. Chewing gum has other health benefits such as helping to freshen breath and quell coughs.

On the other hand there was a nagging fear that it might actually not make it to screens. To his surprise a few months after that 'Women in Film' script was selected for production, and the film came out in the summer of 2010. It was an instant hit. It also made more than double its initial budget.


That's the basic narrative.


What makes the narrative compelling is the evolution of the story over the course of the script. It starts out as a straightforward road-to-screenplay success story, but the story takes a few unexpected turns and becomes a fascinating exploration of creativity, luck"," That was a year ago. Since then he has turned to reading books, in particular the trilogy The Horse Whisperer by Doreen St. Clare. He found the first one in a used library and realized, as he walked through the store, how rare this was: this story seemed to him to encapsulate what it was like to be a writer and the trials they had to endure. He made his purchase and began to read. 

He learned how the protagonist, Tom Saywer, an amateur horse expert whose job was to help horses recover from injuries, had to take control of all aspects of his work and live from day to day: the bookish Tom, he would take walks outside and look at the world around him; he would talk to the horses and watch how they reacted to his words, he would make lists of every aspect of his work and his life and prioritize one over the other; he would sleep, dream and wait for inspiration. 

And, one day, it came. This was, apparently, not the way horses operated, but Tom learned the hard way that not everything happens according to plan. And the more he learnt the more he realized that he had always learned by chance, and that he would have to change that. The book's plot is built around that turning point. There is also a beautiful love story between Tom and a young girl who inspires him. Nicholas Evans did not intend to write a book, but the experience","  He and his partner had invested everything in the film: the couple's two young daughters would be in it - but its director was now jobless and he and his producer were up to their necks in debt. Desperate, he took a call from an old friend who offered to introduce him to a horse whisperer. At first reluctant, as his friends had heard of this British man only for his bad reputation.  But a second visit convinced him. One week later he arrived in the horse whisperer's ranch in the wilds of Oregon to meet the man who had transformed the career of an actor from Hollywood to stardom and redemption for his family.  Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director was in awe of the man who could turn an ordinary horse into a horse whisperer.  But his awe became obsession when, at his request, the horse whisperer revealed the secret of his success.  The man had been a famous actor.  But he was also a horse thief. Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director would later write a successful film about the man's life, The Horse Whisperer. The British man had been the star of the film that had earned him the title of 'Horse Whisperer'. The man's first role had been as a horse thief.  And his ability to transform horses into horseshoes had saved his life. Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director"," It was only later, as he replayed the frantic final hours of production, that he realised he had made a terrible mistake. Then, as now, he felt the weight of responsibility. But at least as of then he had already begun to feel a nagging sense of deja vu. He had written and directed films before; he was only 27 years old; and in his youth he had received critical acclaim for television screenplays for such shows as Sharpe and The Thick of It. It was only later, as he began to consider what might have caused this first- novel sense of déjà vu, that he realised he may have read the same book—and that it could be the source of his troubles. This was because that book was The Horse Whisperer by Craig Johnson. It was a page-turning tale of a troubled boy, Frank Zhang, and the horse he spent hours with each day. It was a book that captured the imagination of millions of readers, and was even named among the year's best books by many commentators, including Michael Flesch, Robert McKee, and James Patterson. It seems possible, therefore, that Evans may have read The Horse Whisperer not once but twice. He recalls thinking: ‘At first I was fascinated by the subject but later I started to worry that all this time I had been thinking I was making a film and instead I was spending my time on a horse.’ But perhaps the nagging"," And it was the bank manager who, Evans realised, had the last laugh: the film had indeed been made but for reasons beyond Evans's control. It was a success. But the film was not his. The last straw came when he watched the completed film with his girlfriend, still reeling from the good news. 'Well, at least it's in the theaters now', he said with sarcasm. 'It really was a success. My girlfriend even said it was one of her favorites.' His girlfriend looked at him, wide-eyed, 'Really?'. 'Of course it was. Who else would be seen it but you?' He was aghast. For a few seconds the only sound in the room was the ticking of the clock. 'But the money...' he said. His girlfriend looked at him, wide-eyed, 'That too?' She nodded, 'More than enough. It pays your mortgage and all the other bills. You can do anything you want with it. You can finally afford your own flat and you can even give some to your parents.' 'But it's not mine', he said, stung. 'Well if it's not then it should belong to me. If I haven't earned it I should not have it.' At this his girlfriend burst into tears. 'But it's not yours. It's mine, and if I had earned it then I should be the one to have it. It's my birthday soon and I want"," In that time he had invested thousands of hours and thousands of pounds himself. He'd invested his time and his energy and the idea of his entire future... In the months that followed, life in general became more hectic than it had been and he was never able to focus fully on his screenwriting, but there were moments when he would think back fondly to that time in his life when everything was going so well. In the summer of 2012 he'd just returned from a successful screenwriting competition in San Francisco when he learned that one of the films he'd funded had been selected to be turned into a television series. Titled The Horse Whisperer, it was to star the then rising British star Michelle Dockery. It had been a glorious moment in which he'd felt truly, truly alive. The entire industry was buzzing. The project had garnered him critical acclaim and millions of pounds in investment. He was on top of the world. But all good things must come to an end, or so they say. In the middle of the following year his bank called to tell him they were reducing his loan - drastically. The only problem was, they offered no explanation. They simply hung up. He'd just received his last pay-out. And he was about to lose everything. When the phone rang a second time, it was the bank calling back, this time offering him a deal: if he signed a new contract he could keep the majority of his investment but"," But worst of all was the sudden death of his partner. The suddenness of the end was hard to absorb. His partner had been with him through a variety of projects, each of them fraught with peril. But it was his sudden passing that would force him to reconsider what a partner was and what it meant. Nicholas Evans, the screenwriter producer, came to learn that what his partner meant to him could not be expressed by pounds or euros, and what was required for a partnership to flourish was not the currency but the deep sense of connectedness and understanding between two people that came from falling down and getting up again. After several weeks of deep thinking, soul searching, and a trip to India, where he visited two renowned gyms, one with a special focus on injury rehabilitation the other one with dedicated space for rehabilitation classes, he concluded that the only way to build a lasting relationship was through a rigorous, daily regime of falling down and getting up again. A strict daily regime of getting up and stretching, then lying down for fifteen minutes, then getting up and stretching, then lying down for fifteen minutes, then getting up and stretching, and so on. Within a few weeks his partner was with him at every workout and he knew she would always be there when he needed her, so in that sense the promise of that film was more than met. The partnership he was looking for, he realized, could not be measured in currency but by the promise of what they would build together over"
" Other members of the team are equally impressive. Ben Cotton brings a deep power to his stage performance as Rinaldo; Tim Pigott-Smith brings a deliciously villainous intensity to Sebastian; while Sian Thomas-Jenkins injects a wonderful lightness to Shakespearian hero Bajazzle.

Dazzling direction from Luke Bayer makes for some breathtaking and spectacular set changes: from a huge pile of skulls to a bare stage, to the battlements of a city. And every moment on the night is freighted with dramatic tension as Antony spouts out his words to the city below or spits venom at his enemies or engages in head-to-head swordplay with Bajazzle.

The ensemble work and the energy generated on the stage ensure that this is an outstanding production. It leaves us gasping for more and is a must-see.

In 1623, playwright Thomas d’Abingdon published A True Imitation of the Three Kings, an account of a mythical king that resembles, in style and themes, a literary ancestor of the pantomime: Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare. It seems likely that Shakespeare had at least heard of d’Abingdon’s work, and had, no doubt, seen its title page, which included a portrait of the dramatist.

THEATRE A. Tamburlaine the Great

By George Chapman


Marlowe’s text has been chopped and hacked by director Terry Hands in his staging of Shakespeare’s “Tamburlaine the Great.” Antony Sher’s head-first somersault down the theatre’s balcony makes for a memorable entrance, while Sebastian – one of","  

Tamburlaine has become a soldier of fortune in Central Asia, where his reputation as a soldier, warrior and general is second to none. He returns to a joyous homecoming to Lotharingia but finds it has changed, the old landowners and the old ways have been forgotten, Tamburlaine is not welcome and his enemies await. 

Sher is electric in the final battle scene with several high-risk moves to avoid arrows, swords, axes and other weapons; as he emerges from behind a tree on his huge horse and the curtain rises, the final battle rages. 

This production brings a real ‘blood and thunder’ feel to a play of immense power, adventure, and grandeur.

"," Ben Whishaw is a born Marlowe and brings some magic to Tamburlaine’s closest companion and sometime love, Michaelitas.


The action begins with a funeral, then two squabbling merchants are attacked by Tharsis in the Egyptian desert and the two groups become enemies. Tamburlaine, who is visiting his friend Sultan Chulman, arrives just in time to join forces with Chulman and Sher to defeat Tharsis' allies. Sher returns to plead for Tamburlaine’s hand in marriage to his sister. He has been captured and sold into slavery. Meanwhile, Michaelitas grows jealous of Tamburlaine’s devotion to another and plots to have him killed.

When the next scene opens at night, Sher has made a daring rescue but it is too little, too late for Michaelitas, who has been stabbed to death. Now Tamburlaine and Chulman are the warring enemies and Sher is their only hope to defeat Tharsis. Sher’s speech on duty to the Englishmen, who are about to enter battle, is a masterpiece. The cast is superb; Whishaw, who is from Stratford-upon-Avon, gives an actor’s performance as Tamburlaine; Sher’s voice is perfect as Marlowe’s famous narrator and the play’s final “And with such sacrifices, my sword, we gain” has the packed theatre on"," The other star is Jessica Hynes as Perdita, who is one of many women to make an appearance in this revenge tragedy. She seems almost an afterthought but by the final act her fate has become intertwined with that of Tamburlaine’s, as they duel across a vast arena, and her determination is equal to his. In a neat stroke of casting and choreographic wizardry, Fergal Callanan as Scrub, the slave, has the distinction of being the youngest man on stage. He dances with a sort of frenetic grace that brings to mind an Oscar winner from the previous century and he leaves the stage in the arms of his devoted owner Kiki. But there is just not enough of this production as a whole and the one aspect that could have been expanded is the role of the Sultan. There is something deeply unedifying about a tyrant issuing threats to another tyrant, whether it be in the form of war or of an ever greater fine. Such a dichotomy between good and evil could have been explored further but instead we are treated to a smarmily threatening monologue delivered with an arrogant assurance. The Sultan is reduced to little more than a cardboard figure whose only aim appears to be self aggrandisement. The rest of the cast is strong enough to provide adequate support and the production could surely have benefited from a slightly more active participation from the Sultan’s guards and advisors. But on balance this is a compelling production"," 

Antony Sher is a fine Shakespearean actor and has done a number of Marlowe. But I have to admit to finding this production a bit too one-note. Antony has the energy and verve of a born leader but there wasn’t much depth of character or complexity in his motivations or desires. The speeches tend to be rants and raves with no underlying logic or meaning but that is part of the excitement of the play. 

The action is driven by the need for Tamburlaine to win the final contest of swords against the caliph who has proclaimed himself the King of Kings. Sher leaps from speech to speech without a break as Tamburlaine enters the arena with a procession of champions as he pours out a barrage of insults and demands of his captains. His speeches are punctuated with leaps from floor to floor as Tamburlaine surveys his champions. 

The action is also accompanied by a large percussion section that adds the thunder of battle and the boom of cannon. Marlowe, like Shakespeare, is also a poet of the ear and the voices of his ensemble are superb as they sing as they run from battle to the balcony to stand in ranks and fire. The female voice of Sophronia, the Queen of Persia is a particularly fine blend of power and femininity and her duet with Antony Sher is an explosion of energy and passion.

Spend an evening with Tamb"," In the title role is a fine match for the role but Sher, as the Sultan, doesn’t seem quite born to the role – this is definitely one for Sher to improve in. If Sher isn’t quite there on that night then the equally energetic Stephen Topor as Tamburlaine’s best friend and squire Merkurius, Mark Flitton as one of Tamburlaine’s guards and Alex Hassell as the Sultan’s lieutenant all have magnificent nights. There are even flashes of Tamburlaine the Great in this actor-led ensemble where Hassell takes charge of a knife fight and then emerges from a cage for a sword duel. The cast also brings depth and range to the complex roles of the false prophet Delboeuf and of the Sultan’s guard in their subtle questioning of their loyalties and questions for the audience about who can lead the faith. One gets the impression there’s quite a struggle going on within the three main characters and no easy answers here but that doesn’t stop this production from being engrossing and moving. A superb production.

Note: The"
" The black-and-white version here is grainy and heavily edited. Jones has some good moments but the film as a whole feels hastily assembled and unoriginal. The main story is set against a war-torn Guadalcanal landscape which looks convincing and has appropriate light and weather. Jones seems to have gotten all the right characters right - most notably the charismatic, cigar-smoking Japanese commander Sugi aka ""the Peregrine"" and tough Marine fighter pilot Billy Kyle. There's a lot of conflict and action - even a submarine battle - but Jones skirts the more dramatic moments. Sugi is too ruthless and Billy too spineless. Jones has some nice character scenes but they never coalesce into a compelling story. The editing is choppy and the pacing is too rapid. This is a good example of a technically impressive war film which lacks the soul or characterisation to make it great. Recommended. (Subtitles: English) A few good scenes and performances but too much action and not enough characterisation to make for compelling viewing. Rating: 6/10 - B-movie stuff but very competently made.

I love the Cold War era and this film has very nice production and effects. But the dialogue and characters don't hold my interest. The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes in movies directed by Howard Hawks. If it weren't for the"," Despite being set in WWII it looks and sounds like a World War I epic as two armies duel for control of a vital railway junction through torrential rain and mudslides A stunning cast includes Harrison Ford, Paul Bettany, Sean Bean and John Hurt. 

Here is a plot summary:

Bud Lisagor (Harrison Ford) is a roughneck drill sergeant whose unflinching leadership and indomitable optimism have inspired a band of ragtag oil rig workers to do their best work.  

Damon (Paul Bettany) is a taciturn navy mechanic with a heart of gold.  

Bud’s most trusted team members are Ray (Sean Bean) an unremarkable ex-boxer who is a bit slow, and Ernie (John Hurt) a stooped actor with a twinkle in his eye. 

Damon and Ray form a tentative relationship. 

Bud’s friend and fellow rigger, Matt (Toby Kebbell), joins the team.  

Damon’s sister, Kate (Nicole Kidman), moves into the complex to live with him, and the pair begin a relationship.

 A team of oil rig workers band together against the odds to rescue a U.S. Navy submarine trapped far beneath the sea's surface.  

When the mission to free the submarine,  the ""sleeper agent"", is compromised and the","  In Jones' version the US Marines have been pushed too far to the front - the story and its characters take on the urgency and desperation of a last-ditch counter-offensive against a ferociously well-equipped foe. Jones' film is more conventional in its structure and pacing though this is offset by an impressively eerie combination of slow-motion, superimposition and panning. A thrilling battle sequence is packed into a single, dizzyingly dizzying sequence. Cinematographer Russell Boyd deploys slow-motion and panning with great flair in a similar fashion to John Hillcoat's recent The Way of the Warrior. Jones himself is best known for his novel Strange Adventures in a Lesser Known Land but this is his first Hollywood film. While the result is closer in tone to Malick's The Thin Red Line than the war epic Jones told to the screenwriting staff for World War II - Jones himself was a Marine officer - the parallels between the two are certainly striking. Jones' story is also arguably closer in spirit to Blow Out by Curtis Hanson.  Set during the war in Guadalcanal, Jones' is about two small but dedicated teams of Marines fighting to the bitter end against horrendous odds for their own cause and their country's. Like Jones' film they have a few weapons each - Hanson's is a M14 rifle with a bayonet and a Thompson Submachine gun (Tanka) - but what really"," Malick takes a slightly earlier view of the Guadalcanal campaign, focusing on the experiences of the marines. The story of the battle is well told and the action scenes and special effects are top notch. Although the cast includes Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio there is little interest here for the battle itself or the valiant marines who suffered so terribly from shortages of weapons and equipment. But the performances are solid and the film serves its purpose to remind us of the bravery of the marines. B+ But the real appeal of Jones's novel is its combination of a powerful story and its author's deft handling of the characters and dialogue. Director Marton adapts the story with admirable economy and the cast of just two actors, Chris Cooper and Benecio Del Toro, give their all and their lines are never less than serviceable. Cooper, as an executive in the Pentagon during the war, is convincing as the hardnosed type who hates to show emotion; Cooper plays the parts of those around him with equal competence and the lines his colleagues spout have an air of authenticity. Del Toro is also good as the ""greaseball"" petty officer who becomes romantically involved with Cooper. The most interesting part of the story comes from Jones's handling of the relationships between the characters. Cooper and Del Toro get to show off their dramatic chops and their offbeat chemistry as the two marines and their ship's engineer are entertaining to watch."," Jones' novel tells of the exploits of a US Marine battalion on Guadalcanal in 1943 as they battle a Japanese amphibious invasion and a huge naval fleet under Admiral Kuribayashi. Jones's novel has the same feel and texture to it and the performances from the three leads, Joel Keesman, Josh Helman and Dave Chapman are all superb. Keesman is the young lieutenant who will go on to become one of cinema's great heroes. As the battle for Guadalcanal rages he and fellow marine Corporal John Marston (Josh Helman) endure the ferocity of the fighting, often at close quarters, and will be exposed to the most horrific conditions. It's this atmosphere of extreme physical danger and fear that gives this drama its power. There's a remarkable scene in which the Marine unit is attacked while out in the sea off Savo Island and our two heroes are almost swallowed up by the shark-infested waters. The tension and drama rise dramatically from here. Jones's novel could have become a great war movie without the aid of special effects and he and director Michael Bay would still have produced a tense and exciting watch. However, the inclusion of such techniques gives it extra potency. A1 General education Film Critic James gives the movie three stars out of five He notes that the movie is full of big-budget special effects and looks impressive but the story isn't compelling and the dialogue is often wooden. The video release of this version of"," Jones was a Marine Corps captain in the Pacific during WWII and a correspondent in the South Pacific for Stars and Stripes. Both films explore the conflict through the viewpoint of its characters and the battle scenes are gripping, especially for the younger viewers of the audience of the Terrence Malick film. Jones' experience on Guadalcanal informs the conflict but it's the South Pacific in 1942, not the pacific as we know it today. Still the fight against the Japanese is as gripping as any war movie made in the last 70 years. Jones' perspective is unique and highly insightful. But it's the dialogue which is most notable - and that's because it's written almost entirely by John Milius, the director of The Hunt for Red October and its sequel. That's not exactly a compliment because Milius can be a hack and doesn't know the first thing about warfare or human character. Milius also doesn't know the first thing about how to write a movie script but his dialogue for Jones (and, again, for the whole production) is so verbose, stuffed with the kind of clichéd phrases that make even the biggest enthusiast wish Jones had written it himself. As it is, Milius' dialogue makes a pretty impressive case for itself in a B-movie. Still, for all Milius' failings, it's Jones who knows what it's really like to fight the Japanese and what it's really like to survive the Pacific. And"," Jones' historical novel, set in 1942, is the closest thing to'mainstream' cinema has to a great war film. While Malick's Vietnam epic is a subjective journey through time the Japanese invasion of Solomon Islands is a brutally specific account of one of history's bloodiest conflicts. And so it is With Jones' novel. There's little poetry to Guadalcanal. There are no epics or battles of immense historical import. Jones instead has written a taut B-movie with a bloody streak, grim and brutal but with some of its moments of beauty. Like Malick's film, it's a work of realism. He depicts the carnage of combat with astonishing accuracy. There's little that's Hollywood or propagandistic about the depiction of battle. Guadalcanal, like any other land battle in the Pacific, is grim and bloody. In places, the novel seems to take poetic license with Guadalcanal's beautiful landscape, using it to emphasise the horror of war. But it's effective use of real place and atmosphere helps to make this a gripping story of a battle lost to time and the hard realities of war. Guadalcanal is at the same time a grim and beautiful tale of a battle lost to time and the hard realities of war. The characters and their interactions are the heart of the story. The men of the 24th Marine Regiment, the 'thin red line', are a motley crew. Of all the US soldiers fighting"
" And newspaper owners are now admitting to the future of their business: that it’s now totally and exclusively online. This means that even the print newspaper business has already ‘transitioned’ into a completely different medium. Or has it? Not exactly. At least in Germany that’s not the case. And the reason is the ‘AbendsZeit’ the evening edition of the Bild newspaper (which will become a weekly soon). At 11 pm each Thursday (until then it was only once a month) Bild prints a special supplement. This supplement is printed in a different format than any other edition of the newspaper, it’s a tabloid size, its print quality is notoriously bad and it costs much more. But nobody cares because the supplement has been printed for decades and used to be a vital source of advertising revenue for Bild. But now? Bild, of course, would like to keep it as an option for its existing subscribers. But with the rise of online media Bild’s business model has broken down. It just doesn’t make sense anymore. Bild is now forced to sell this tabloid edition at a very attractive price. In March the publisher Axel Springer will buy the supplement for 600 million euros. The ‘AbendsZeit’ will remain in the Bild newspaper’s portfolio. And the reason is: it’s still too big a source of income to let it go. Even in the digital age, even"," It is as if our forefathers in the 1800s are rearing their ugly heads, determined to snatch the remaining print revenues away from our contemporary ‘transition’ to a digitally enabled world. What is all this hubub about? Well the answer is – the company by the name of InMind, an outfit owned by Times Media, is about to launch a ‘newspaper website’ using a blockchain technology. Well the website is expected to go live in the first week of June. So, what is ‘a blockchain technology’. Well it’s a decentralized, distributed, public ledger of all the verified transactions occurring across a network of computers linked to each other using the blockchain technology. It’s all very technical so I’ll let the marketing people of Times Media handle the explanation. I would just like to add that the adoption of blockchain in newspapers and other ‘traditional media’ will be a gamechanger that will lead to a ‘new way of doing business’. 

The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It’s a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless that is it is newspapers’ ‘transition’ to the online world an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process – because frankly it may not be a process at all. But surely (you say) it is bound to happen eventually. Everybody knows that print newspaper sales"," And just for fun, check out which newspapers have the largest online communities – the people who have made them famous on social media. It’s the Huffington Post. The Daily Mail. Murdoch’s Sun. The Telegraph. It’s the broadsheets, isn’t it? Well, they certainly will be extinct by 2025. The Daily Mail is already gone. And the Telegraph is going too. But there will surely be a print version of the Huffington Post. Or there is already. Just ask Alexa. And it sure will be called the Washington Post. 

And that, dear learners, is why the Washington Post bought Facebook. The move is being seen by the experts as the first step to a print revival. And not just a few years from now. When you put it in the long-term context of the newspaper business, a mere transition may seem a simple thing. In fact, it is the greatest news of all. 

Let me conclude by quoting a wise person – the late George Orwell, who once said that ‘Happiness is not a reward; it is the byproduct of work being meaningful.’ I leave you with that.

In summary, reading or listening to content that is difficult for A2 learners to understand, or even just telling them that the printed word will probably become a"," So papers transition to the website. Well the website, for all the improvements it has brought to our reading experience, lacks a number of key elements that once were there only in print format. I remember, for instance, how my school library had a special rack that gave you the option to check all your newly purchased books for errors in the digital form and, if found, to transmit you a pdf of the original hard copy (that had the errors marked and clearly identified). I cannot even find such a rack at the moment! And there are countless other examples where the website lacks certain features that once were part of the printed experience. For example I am unable to print a pdf of any of my Power Point presentations even though this option used to be there in paper version. I can go to the website and download as many copies as I want and then import them into my various presentations software. That’s nice. But this is not the same as having the pdfs in hand to begin with. And there are many other features the website lacks that I remember having in paper versions. Do you see the pattern? Once paper based we transitioned to the digital world. Now we are going from digital to digital and that transition leaves many things behind. And we all hope that the move to the online world will improve the website to a point where it will once again satisfy the desires for quality reading experience that are part and parcel of any good newspaper or magazine. But to our surprise I have found"," They also include the electronic copy but more of that another day. But in any case, this ‘transition’ to the digital age is something that we’re bound to see happen at some point. It’s like a passing storm. You can ignore it or get a protective umbrella but you’ll miss out on the beauty of the storm if you don’t go there. And even if this storm is going to pass you may still get some water on the way. And don’t forget to take some umbrellas with you. That would be prudent. I will leave the transition to you. You’re in the driving seat of your newspaper so do the right thing.

The End

‘Transition’ is a calming and a sweet word that I hope my peers appreciate. I wish I could give a better transition to the online world. It may not be a process but at least let it happen without worrying too much about it. We’ll just wait patiently and let it happen. And yes, I’ll take some umbrellas along for protection.

Peter Preston: Let us hope that this transition occurs without causing serious inconvenience to the newspapers’ customers and that there is, if not beauty in this storm, at least water on the way. I wish you luck.

The CEFR scale is a tool that teachers, trainers and instructors can use to"," In 2016, according to a study by the Pew Research Center, 32 percent of US adults over the age of 12 had never heard of the Washington Post, a newspaper founded 541 years ago on January 6, 1683.

" I spend a lot of time preparing for operations and studying videos of operations. I also do lots of reading to keep up with research."" ""My typical day is hard but fulfilling and I get to use my brain. Some people might say it’s stressful but it’s interesting and full of possibilities. I feel calmer and more optimistic after an operation and often know what the outcome will be."" B. THE LAWYER Name: Claire Age: 45 Claire'S DAY ""I’m a lawyer, I represent individuals, corporations and governments, in court and in negotiation. My day can be stressful and sometimes hard work but it feels right and natural to me and I’m passionate about what I do. My typical working day is 7am to 7pm. I work out of an office in London, I have a laptop and I often work remotely from home. My working day starts with checking emails and other business to be got done before I open my laptop. From there I spend a good amount of time working on documents, typing and highlighting. As the day progresses, I check my case diary and make notes. At the end of the day, I will do some data entry from files I’ve created or downloaded. My work is fast-paced and busy, and there can be a lot of interaction with other people. But the work itself is very fulfilling. My colleagues are very supportive and make me feel valued. My day will sometimes be hard, but it's a"," I've been known to get so excited during a operation that I forget to eat and go to the loo. I'm lucky though because I'm single so my colleagues have learned to accept this. "" ""My colleague, Dr X, will give me a quick rundown of what has just happened in her operation, she will also give me advice on what to look out for to give the best patient care, this calms me down. My colleague, Dr Y, will give a long and detailed overview of how we performed the operation, she will also tell us what went wrong and what to do differently the next time. She makes me feel part of the team, which is great for my confidence and well-being. Finally, the surgeon, Dr Z, will give a quick overview of the operation, ask questions about my practice, and give me a snapshot of what it’s like to be a surgeon. She is fun to be around and has great sense of humour, this helps with banter and keeps us all on our toes. She is also a very good sport when things go wrong, this is so refreshing. "" B. DENTIST Name: Birgit Age: 34 Birgit's day ""I start my day at 7am. I normally perform 16 patients between 8am and noon and then start preparing for the afternoon shift. I will spend the afternoon cleaning, filing and organizing the dental surgery. Afterwards, around 5pm I will start my evening shift, which"," My head is split between seeing and hearing what is happening, assessing the condition of the patient, and knowing exactly how to position and insert the necessary equipment. I have to think quickly, without being too imprecise. It can be stressful to operate on people without a quick death sentence, but the patients are typically fully conscious so that can be a great boost for my confidence. The pay isn't great, but in my specialty (spine) the hours are good. I enjoy my work but it can be stressful because there are very few check-ins or updates and my job can change daily. In summary, operating is physically demanding but I don't mind operating and if it were not for the time commitment it would be an amazing job."" B. THE PSYCHOLOGIST Name: Carla Age: 33 CARLA’S DAY ""Psychologist's work is rewarding as we help people who are suffering and it goes straight into my heart. The patients love me and for them I do what I’m best at. I work best with people, and if I am in session with someone, no one else is good to them. I can also be empathetic and therefore I am best at listening to people. As a psychologist I am great at understanding people, and helping them to understand themselves. I also like the physical aspect as I feel like I am helping people gain clarity and understanding, and they feel like they can help themselves and feel better too. I like the constant"," Sometimes it feels like I am operating at twice normal capacity and that my brain is operating double the speed. My colleagues describe me as dedicated and focused, with a good bedside manner. They also say I can be chatty. I’d love to talk all day. I enjoy engaging with patients but I’m not great at small talk, and I worry about ending my conversation too quickly as I have found it’s hard to tell how much I have learned from colleagues. If you were to ask me my proudest moment I would say it’s when my colleague at the other end of the wire saved my life at work last year. It was a difficult operation which went wrong and the patient was close to cardiac arrest. My colleague contacted the intensive care unit, called the cardiac surgeon and within minutes someone arrived with a defibrillator and everything calmed down. I didn’t realize it had gone wrong until afterwards. I can be quick to anger when things go wrong, and tend to overreact when things go wrong. Sometimes my colleagues describe me as brash, but they are also surprised I haven’t been sued yet for medical malpractice. "" B.

I may also prepare their medicine, take"," I can often be found lying down in the waiting area with my dog or playing with my poodle or doing housework. The stresses of the job come from operating on people who are not pleasant patients. There is a fine balance between offering too little anesthetic while the patient still feels intense pain and too much and this can be challenging. My day often ends around 10pm. I love my work because the operations I carry out are typically complex procedures and usually very helpful to humanity. The work is challenging but very fun too. B. THE BUSINESS POWERHOUSE Name: Katy Age: 38 KATY’S DAY ""I’m a Business Powerhouse. I build companies and create ideas that people LOVE. My day typically starts around 8am when I wake up, I’ll put on some espresso and start my day by going to Slack to look into new ideas. After my first cup of coffee I will get to work through Slack with my team building ideas and then we will create a plan of attack to start execution of those ideas. My work is typically very fun, however there are times when I get stress because of the amount of work I am responsible for. C. THE ACTRESS Name: Natasha Age: 22 NATASHA'S DAY ""I am an actress. I use my training to perform in theatre and perform in commercials. My day begins at 10am where I wake up, I prepare my lines with an acting coach"," 

Rebecca Cripps is a brain surgeon. Operating on the brain requires careful handling as there is a high risk of injury from the cutting and grinding involved. She works long hours, usually starting at 8am. She also discusses the drawback of the job, ""Operating can be stressful"". 

B. AN OBstetrician/Gynaecologist Name: Jackie Age: 32 Jackie'S DAY ""I take calls in the morning when the husband is in a deep sleep, sometimes taking up to an hour to locate the foetus. I perform a C-section and remove the baby while the husband sleeps, so I need to operate quickly. Sometimes I find it difficult to stay calm through an operation.

Rebecca Cripps is an obstetrician/gynecologist. An obstetrician/gynecologist is known as a gynaecologist in the US. They diagnose and treat women's reproductive organs. They usually do this while the woman is awake. They perform a variety of operations, from the removal of foetuses through to operations on the womb. Rebecca does not perform operations while sleeping. She states, ""Operating quickly and keeping calm can be difficult"".

To do this, I have to look at different labels and read instructions to make sure the medicine is taken correctly. This means"," When I operate there’s a lot going on. My brain is doing a million things and the more I am operating the more my body needs nourishment and rest. Eating has to be regulated. It’s the most challenging part of my working day. It’s also tiring getting up, getting ready and going back to sleep. And then there’s the physical demands: my eyes are constantly looking down at my instrument to maintain a sterile operating environment. There’s a lot of moving around and also disinfecting the instruments between cases and changing the gloves and masks every hour or so. It can get very dirty and there’s a lot of wiping. Sometimes my hands are red from bleeding. I’ve also injured myself a few times when I’ve dropped instruments or tried to lift something too heavy."" B.

" I wander around, inspecting Hurst's work and taking pictures with my smart phone. In total there are seven pieces in various stages of completion and Hurst appears to be making two of them. After a minute or two I ask: 'How does one actually finish a piece of furniture?' 'You need to take it from the beginning to the end', Hurst answers. 'You have the plan, you know how you want it to look, you know how much wood and what kinds of wood to use, you know how much glue to apply, you know how to apply glue, you know how to fasten all the pieces together, you know how big the finished piece needs to be and you know your budget'. To finish the piece Hurst is now working on I need to follow these steps in reverse order. To actually finish a piece of furniture you first need to know where you want to start. I point my phone's camera at the work in front of me. Hurst approves. 'Perfect!', he says. I return to my seat and Hurst gives me a detailed explanation of every single step of the furniture-making process. I learn that I cannot just buy a piece of furniture and expect it to be completed. If you are building furniture you need to understand how each piece fits in with the other and how the final product as a whole is going to look. Even if you only make minor adjustments to an existing piece of furniture, you have to be"," He has placed neatly placed a pile of screws, bolts and other hardware on a worktop at one end and to the left of the archway is a large wood-turned metal box full of different shaped mortice and dovetail joints, a crucial component of a piece of furniture. There is a large, beautifully finished trunk that looks very heavy, but when I ask Hurst how much it is he just shrugs and indicates that it is up to me to try and lift it. Unsure whether the answer is a shrug or not I opt to take his advice and lift the trunk with some care and with some effort to be sure. My eyes water at the strain and Hurst gives me a look that says 'good with that'. I'm relieved when he then takes the trunk and places it back on the workbench. As I look around I notice two further items that Hurst has made, one of which is a very intricately carved and detailed table which looks very heavy indeed, but he tells me it weights about 12 stone. Hurst is clearly well travelled and has learned from his many travels that good quality wooden furniture will last longer if cared for and treated with respect. His shelves are full of wood blocks, chisels, routers, planers and other tools and equipment needed to make fine furniture. In fact it is from his shelves that he makes all of the pieces he is currently working on and as we begin to talk it soon becomes clear that Hur"," Charles Hurst is a self-taught cabinet-maker who has developed a workshop that he runs from his own property in East London. He takes orders for bespoke furniture and delivers the pieces within 2 weeks at the most. In addition he works on commission to furniture retailers, who visit him directly for specific pieces.   

In a matter of minutes Hurst draws up a plan of the order and starts cutting wood in the adjacent workshops. The work area consists of a saw, drill, drill bit, saw blade, glue stick and an assortment of other woodworking tools. The saw has several sizes from 10 to 60 cm blades, a table and a clamping system for the wood and the wood. Next to the saw we find a drill press, where wood is pressed together in several layers to strengthen the glue. Hurst makes use of a drill bit, which is used for the holes into which dowels are inserted. The dowels are glued into the holes with a glue stick that are used to keep the joints of the wood. At the end of the work area is a small, portable wood stove, where Charles Hurst dries and finishes the pieces by hand after they have been glued together. When asked about his working habits Hurst comments that he is very much a hands on designer, where every single part is made by hand and has a direct relation to the final product.   

As we discuss his working methods, we realise that he is actually"," The most beautiful piece of all is in the foreground; it is a pair of dining chairs that appear to have grown out of the floor. Each chair is covered in intricate carvings of flowers and leafy branches. On closer inspection one notices a fine thread of silk stretched across the back of each chair. Charles Hurst invites me to sit down on one of the chairs, which are as comfortable as they are beautiful.  He explains that these pieces have been in his mind for some time and when I express an interest he offers to show me his drawings and ideas, which make up a large part of his portfolio. Hurst seems both inspired and impatient at the same time but after we have pored over several sketches I am convinced that his desire to get things done is perfectly legitimate. We discuss the idea of having a go at carving wooden animals and I point out that he could sell them in a shop. Hurst appears to agree but his next comment is to suggest we go for a coffee rather than keep going over my ideas. We decide that he will fetch his car and drive me to a nearby coffee shop. 

This narrative is poorly written and is very difficult to understand, despite the use of simplified language and paragraph separators. The grammar is poor and sentence construction is awkward. It is hard to determine the main point of the narrative and the author does not establish clear author identification. Despite these issues, this narrative is aimed at Grade 2 learners and could provide valuable introduction"," The materials are from all over the world- from Brazilian cherry to English beech- and all of them have found their way here to join a range of other carefully selected, yet imperfectly crafted pieces of furniture. Hurst is clearly passionate about his work and it shows; the floor is covered with clutter and there is an air of excitement and creative energy in the room. He takes the time to show me his prized possession, a rare red cedar table from Sri Lanka which has travelled many thousands of miles with him from its natural origins in Asia. When we finally sit down to talk, it quickly becomes apparent that this is no hurried executive; Charles Hurst has a huge capacity for empathy and listening; and his eyes light up when talking about his travels. As the conversation moves on to his work, Hurst reveals that he is a cabinet-maker by trade but that his love affair with furniture began when he first visited a stately home as a child. There he saw the treasures the family had collected through the years, all carefully arranged and hung on the walls. His eyes were drawn to the beautiful wood furniture from across the land: British oak and cherry, mahogany and walnut, rosewood and cherry. They spoke to his soul. Returning to England aged 16 with his family he worked hard for five years to save enough money to buy his own shop; then seven more to set up his own business. Hurst's work ethic is evident in every aspect"," There is a bench covered in a fine layer of dust, a table with an axe, a large block of wood with several notches carved into it and at the front of the room a young lady sits with a tape measure. Together these pieces represent the sum of Hurst's work over the past twelve months and it is clear that it has been an incredible journey. Hurst walks over to the young lady and asks her to measure some of the wood blocks. The young lady carefully examines the blocks and after a few moments begins to explain what she has found. Hurst seems more engaged in what she is saying than the measuring, but when she holds up a block of wood with several notches carved into it he leans in closer to hear her analysis. He has obviously been thinking about the design of the block, the quality of the wood and its potential future value. When she has finished he walks over to the bench and begins to clear a space for me to sit down. He goes to the table and picks up an axe from the workbench. Hurst shows that he is not a man to mess around and immediately resumes work on a new table, using the same axe that he first picked up. When I finally sit down on a bench covered in a fine layer of dust he appears more reserved but seems genuinely happy to talk with me about his work. After we have finished chatting I ask if he works on a project that is in production. He looks surprised and hesitant"," Joanna Watt and her colleague Alfie are transfixed and after a couple of questions about the process behind the pieces, Joanna is already describing her vision for a dining set - a stunning mix of form and function. This is a very good example of someone who creates exceptional pieces of furniture, whether by hand or with modern manufacturing methods and Joanna is clearly an experienced practitioner. Hurst gives a solid account of his work and business: a mixture of hard facts, opinions, jokes and small talk. He has an interest in sustainability and was the founder of the East London Furniture Workshop, for which he is now a leading designer. He has a few inspirational quotations which he says have guided him and he is quick to discuss his own professional development. Joanna asks questions about the process, his inspiration and about the company's future. Hurst clearly enjoys giving straight answers to probing questions and is clearly a man in a hurry.

The autonomously-built ‘D-House’ is another of Britain’s greenest dwellings. Built into a disused quarry in Nottingham, the house is packed with recycled materials. Glass used in windows is salvaged from broken bottles; concrete slabs were used to prevent water from entering the foundation during construction, and recycled plastic was used to make windows.


The architects also built the D-House to be earthquake-resistant, adding reinforced concrete beams around the house and sinking footings deep into the ground. The Vale family is using the D-House to experiment with renewable energy sources while also taking advantage of the building’s unique features to include a recording studio for Brenda’s music business and an artists’ cooperative.


‘We’re experimenting with solar thermal heating,’ says Brenda. ‘We’ve got huge slabs of glass to let the sun in and we’ve got the quarry, which gives us a nice deep foundation.’

[The Vales’ home] contains no central heating or pumps and no electricity or other electrical appliances except for the radio and television. It was recently the scene of a solar-powered protest when a team of scientists from Cambridge University conducted a three-week test of the home’s heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system, the water supply, the sewage system, and all the electrical, electronic, and mechanical appliances. The results of the test revealed a ‘highly efficient’ energy-saving system and a ‘cost-effective’ solution to the environmental problems of energy waste, human and animal health and well-being and resources.


In Southwell, the Vales’ house is the subject of the Local Authorities Green Building Strategy which places it at the forefront of the development of new and refurbished local authority buildings to ensure ‘they are sustainable and low energy.’


Southwell Minster was ‘officially’ recognised by the Church of England as a minster of conscience and so has a church to its own. It is dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin. The Vales’ house is the subject of a plan to convert it into the church itself, though they have yet to move into it. As Southwell is outside the city walls, it has virtually a natural self-sufficient community — with shops, a gym, a pub and even an adventure park (designed to be as green as the house but open to the public). The V"," Far-sighted enough, they are also constructing a wind turbine that will generate electricity to recharge the batteries of the autos that take them round to the shops. This makes Southwell a hub of sustainable technology for an environmentally sensitive post industrial age. The Vales are also members of the ‘World Solar Observatory’ (WSO) and their dwelling is ‘solar-rated’ and therefore ‘net-sustainable’ – the sum of all carbon-negative energy sources minus any carbon-dioxide emissions: this is a useful gauge of how ‘green’ an object or society is.

Solar Survivor Charles Clover meets the ‘autonomous house’ family who have chosen to live an environmentally conscious lifestyle.

On the edge of Nottingham, Southwell Minster and the ‘autonomous house’ are symbols of the green movement’s success in transforming the built environment in the UK.[5] Southwell Minster was the first English cathedral to be built in the English Gothic style after the Norman Conquest in the 11th Century. By the late Middle Ages the cathedral had become the centre of a growing local convent and the seat of a bishop, creating a significant economic and social hub at the crossroads of the region. With the Reformation threatening the existence of the cathedral, Archbishop Grindal founded the Southwell Priory in the 15th Century to protect and preserve it. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Southwell remained the seat of the Bishop of Nottingham until 1784, when its church was declared a “mausoleum of a nation” and the buildings designated a Grade I listed structure. This status, however, was undone during and after the second world war due to damage caused by bombings and subsequent redevelopment.[6] The Priory was also dissolved in 1539, with the former priory church designated a grade I listed building in 1965. The Priory is"," The result is both an environmentally-friendly building and a very British home which can be entered and left as one pleases. The house boasts the largest earth-sheltered living space in Britain. 
While some will argue that the autonomous house is not truly sustainable, if one accepts it can operate as intended and is designed to protect from outside elements the occupants cannot help but feel they are living in the greenest house in Britain. 
Perhaps more importantly, by the end of the house’s first full year of use the Vales had achieved a CO2 emissions reduction of 15,000 tons which equates to the emission of 500 fewer tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in its first full year than if they had stayed in the townhouse they were renting. Not only is this a world first, it’s also one that may change the perception of what it means to live sustainably and make a personal contribution to a greener planet.

The house is located on  of land that the Vales purchased and uses rainwater for washing and drinking, reuses sewage for garden compost and heats the house using waste heat from electrical appliances and the body heat of the residents, their two cats Edison and Faraday. The Vales designed the autonomous house to protect the residents from outside elements so that they could live in a more environmentally friendly"," The ‘autonomous house’ provides complete privacy and security and its construction uses around 65% less resources than ordinary dwellings. Solar Survivor Charles Clover interviews the couple, both of whom are unemployed.

Interviewer: What made you decide to design your own house?

Robert and Brenda Vale: We live in Southwell, a small town in the Nottingham area of the UK. We used to live in an old farmhouse which had been empty for many years. We felt that the old farmhouse had been ‘used up’ and we were both unhappy with the way the house was being maintained so we decided that we wanted to do something to design our own house.

Interviewer: How long did it take you to design your own house?

Robert and Brenda Vale: We worked with an architect and made suggestions for what improvements the house could make. He put these together and we worked with a builder to get the plans drawn up.

Interviewer: What kinds of things did you want your house to have?

Robert and Brenda Vale: We wanted our house to have solar hot water, double glazing, rainwater harvesting, composting, heating with waste heat and full privacy.

Interviewer: Did you set any construction targets?

Robert and Brenda Vale: No, we wanted to keep things as flexible as we felt necessary. Our idea was to build the house as cheaply as","

" Acupuncture aims to restore and balance energy flow by stimulating certain points on the meridians. As the name suggests, stimulation is achieved by the insertion of small needles into the skin. By doing this it’s possible to influence the flow of energy and thus affect the physiological state of the patient. To be able to explain it in layman’s terms, Western medicine sees your body as being a machine with a battery inside it. This battery contains a mix of muscle tissue and nerves and these nerves transmit electrical signals which travel to the spinal cord and brain where they are interpreted. When the machine is not in use the battery is not charged so you need to find a way to allow the body to discharge the electrical signals via the nerves. By inserting tiny needles into specific points on your body’s surface, called trigger points, the body will ‘charge’ these nerves and discharge the actual electrical signals. The nervous system interprets these nerve signals in the spinal cord and brain, which gives the body the signals to discharge the battery and put the machine in a state of rest. This is why acupuncture is also known as the ‘grand cure’. The specific stimulation of certain points on the meridians gives the body instructions on how to discharge the battery so the machine can rest. If you look at the big picture, a machine which has been kept inactive for a long time will not discharge the battery very well so the question is why not stimulate the trigger points to discharge the battery directly."," Chinese doctors believe in the ""gate theory"" where there are four "" doors"" or gates in the body that allow "" evil qi"" to enter the body which is why most Chinese medicine treatment is centred around clearings or moving the "" gates"" and cleaning out stagnant areas. The needles used in acupuncture are about the size of a pin head and are pushed through these small holes at precise angles. This stimulates the meridians and allows the Qi to flow more freely. Western doctors mostly agree that Acupuncture has benefits in treating chronic pain but disagree about whether it is the best or most cost effective way to treat the condition. There are now Acupuncture doctors in the UK who believe in evidence based medicine and have accepted that Acupuncture for pain is little more than placebo. Acupuncture was first introduced into Europe by Portuguese Jesuit missionaries in the 17th century. They translated into Latin the hundreds of thousands of words in Chinese that had become known by that time as medicine travelled from China to Japan and on to Europe. It took many years for Acupuncture to gain acceptance in the West. It was banned in many countries for a long time but now doctors will not operate on you without checking it first. Chinese medicine has been very good for treating joint problems with acupuncture and has also seen success using herbal medicine to treat infections. Chinese medicine is also very good at healing the mind body spirit. It is more a philosophy in looking at health. It doesn't claim to"," If the flow of Qi is disrupted the cause of the problem is looked for in the area where Qi is least present. Wherever Qi is trapped the corresponding organ or part of the body is affected. Chinese medicine holds that if the flow of Qi is restored the organ or part will improve. This has led to increased interest in how to restore or reopen blocked or restricted meridians. The meridians are often described as small rivers of Qi, flowing from one part of the body to another. This theory is also at the heart of acupuncture. Needle insertion along the channels and around the bones in the area to be treated is believed to release blocked or stifled Qi. Acupuncturists believe they can restore the flow of Qi along the meridians by using needles at different directions and depths to release muscle spasms, pain and tightness. The theory that meridians connect areas of the body to other areas is appealing but unproven. It is supported by the fact that acupuncture works and is safe but also that evidence of significant benefits is hard to come by. Doctors in the UK would say the evidence for acupuncture is good but that more research is needed. It’s no wonder then that the popularity of acupuncture has increased in recent years.

*"," Each meridian corresponds to a certain organ system and acupuncturists believe that the flow of qi can be blocked by blockages along the corresponding meridian. When these blockages occur it causes pain. Acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles at various depths into these meridians to ‘relieve’ the blockages. It is controversial whether acupuncture works as well as it’s proponents would have us believe. While a Cochrane review published in 2010 found that it might just might might help some people, several others have produced very positive reviews. For some people it might not be any more helpful than sham (fake) acupuncture. However, many doctors in the United States, Canada and United Kingdom now use it for pain. It has been included in the NHS “care packs” and you may find it at your local GP surgery, doctors, physiotherapists or midwives. It’s not really a quick fix but it can be very powerful. If it works for you, who am I to say no? Acupuncture may well have arrived in Australia in the form of “Sports Acupuncture” used by physios to help athletes stay injury free. Australian Physios Association president, Kym Carmichael, claims that “Sport Acupuncture” has been used by elite athletes competing in all Olympic Games since Athens in 2004. Although she doesn’t know how it compares to “standard” acupuncture, the physios do use the method to help athletes avoid injuries", Acupuncture works by stimulating points on the skin where the meridians are said to be in contact with the underlying tissues so as to increase the flow of energy in that area. Since Qi is believed to be the energy which keeps the body functioning this stimulates the flow of energy in the area being treated which in turn helps to rejuvenate organs and repair damaged tissues. Modern research has also suggested that acupuncture could in the future one day play a part in treating illnesses such as type two diabetes or even Alzheimer’s disease. B. There are two main schools of thought on acupuncture: internal and external. Internal points stimulate the flow of Qi to treat diseases of the organs and in the case of Alzheimer's disease that reduce the flow of Qi. An external source such as an injection of saline stimulates the flow of energy in the body’s meridians to restore Qi and in the case of type 2 diabetes increase the flow of energy to the insulin producing cells of the pancreas in the body. C. Acupuncturists look for points on the skin that are connected to the tissues in need of stimulation. The insertion of a needle or laser will stimulate the nerves in the point which results in the release of the hormones which control the flow of energy around the body in the meridian concerned. D. There is an increasing body of evidence to support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of a range of diseases.  There is no medical evidence supporting the use of acupuncture to treat or," Acupuncture treats imbalance of Qi by inserting needles into specific points on the body to stimulate the flow of Qi.

In the UK acupuncture has only been legal since 1995. This is in contrast to the United States, where it has been legal for the best part of a century. Doctors there are increasingly recommending it for musculoskeletal conditions. In June 2017, a study was published in the BMJ looking at the effectiveness of acupuncture for the management of low back pain. The authors found evidence to support the efficacy of acupuncture in alleviating acute and sub acute low back pain. In conclusion, there is likely merit in pursuing further research in this area and the potential benefits for those suffering from low back pain. The BMJ's position is that acupuncture is an effective form of care for acute and subacute low back pain.

However, there are many concerns over this treatment. The first is the potential for fraud. Some people have found that when comparing prices in the USA versus the UK they have found that the cost of treatment is up to three times higher in the UK. The second is the issue of access to treatment, although there is provision for patients to have acupuncture treatment in NHS hospitals in England, some patients are denied treatment. The third is the issue of side effects. A systematic review of acupuncture and placebo for treatment of chronic pain found that acupuncture may produce side effects such as bruising and bleeding at the needle sites. Fourth, there is the ethical issue of patients suffering from"," It is believed that illness occurs when the flow of Qi is disrupted. Acupuncture aims to restore this flow by stimulating specific points on the skin where the meridians are believed to intersect. Today acupuncture is accepted as an effective treatment for many conditions ranging from back ache to cancer.  Acupuncture is also used by GPs and midwives as part of complementary therapies where it may help with the management of certain symptoms. However the evidence for its effectiveness for these is not as strong as that for acute pain where it is used routinely in the West by doctors.  The evidence to date suggests that acupuncture is at least as effective as standard treatments such as paracetamol and ibuprofen for the relief of acute pain in adults. Some systematic reviews have found acupuncture to be as good as or even better than non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy and massage.  Systematic reviews with higher quality evidence are needed to confirm its effectiveness.  Acupuncture has been found to be as effective as or more effective than pharmacological treatments including codeine, morphine and oxycodone for acute pain relief.  Acupuncture has an excellent safety record.  Despite claims that the needle causes an allergic reaction to the protein in its metal, this is not the case.  The reaction is to red blood cells which can occur but in the majority of cases only causes a skin reaction. Most people do not need to take any medication as an anti-itch or"
" 

Rebecca was his first, but certainly not his last victim. He knew that one day he would get close to the right girl and he would woo her with promises of power, money, and great sex. Her parents had enough money to indulge him, so all he had to do was be persistent and charming. 

When the girl finally agreed to go to dinner with him and his entourage, he did his best to impress her with the new Porsche and boat. He convinced her that he worked really hard to earn all of this money and was a smart boy who would put it to good use for her. 

And he was right about the money. It was all about the money. He would use it to buy her expensive gifts and take her on expensive vacations. He would be the perfect husband who would support her and their children in all their travels and leisure pursuits. He would never have to work again because he would be a hard worker. He would get up early, study, and go to bed late, but then he remembered his own personal time schedule was so he would never be late or early. He was always on time. So she agreed to marry him. 

When they were married, he bought himself a new Porsche and boat. The money flowed and the couple's dreams were funded.

  * His initial victims were rich, attractive women with high standards and a desire for prestige. This caused him to pursue them and"," He turned the page and there was another bridal announcement and a picture of Rebecca with her new husband Clay smiled as he saw that her nose had been broken during the ceremony and she was now sobbing in her seat.

As Clay turned the page again he spotted a small piece of paper stuck in the middle of the magazine. His heart leapt into his throat as he saw the first line of text which said “The wedding of Clay Carter and Jessica Van Horn is off”.

Clay read on further to learn that Jessica had decided to get a divorce from Jason and that she was planning on marrying a man called Bobby Baker. Jason Schubert Myers had nothing to do with this affair and it was proven beyond doubt that Jessica had been having an affair with one of his friends and that was why she had gone to Paris to lose weight. Jason had no involvement whatsoever with the affair.

Clay was so happy that he decided to buy a boat from the very same yacht dealer that had been advertising in the December issue of Capitol Magazine. He was so happy that his life had taken such a dramatic turn for the better and that now he would soon be married to the most beautiful woman in the world, Jessica Van Horn, his lifelong love and who he had always wanted to be with.

Clay continued to flip the pages of the magazine and saw pictures of his two friends from the courtroom dancing and smiling and even one picture of Jessica that was taken by Jessica's brother"," He turned the page to see a picture of Senator Carter standing next to his brother, Congressman Jimmy Carter, who were both beaming with pride and waving at the crowd.  

Clay could tell the crowd was a large one from the number of limousines and support staff surrounding Jimmy and himself.  The Senator was talking about the historic meeting between the two presidents, with Clay nodding and trying to look engaged. President Ford was standing behind the Senator with Vice President Nelson and Secretary of State Kraft on his right and left respectively.  President Carter was on Jimmy's left, looking uncomfortable.  The Vice President, standing with a thin smile on his face as if he was about to say something funny but wasn't quite sure what.  Secretary Kraft, who was in her 60's, looked bored but otherwise seemed capable.  President Ford was a handsome man with greying temples and a ready smile.  The man next to him, standing in the front of the crowd, was the President's brother, Bill Ford.  He was a man of medium height, medium build and had short, light brown hair. He looked uncomfortable as if he wanted to say something but wasn't quite sure what that something was.  At that moment Jimmy Carter spoke. 

""Thank you all for coming today.  I'd like to invite you all to join us here at the White House for a celebration of peace and hope.  I ask that all members of Congress join","

Rebecca has a job in the finance industry and her parents are happily retired. Her main hobbies were reading and the theatre. Clay had actually been impressed with this latter fact, as he had grown up with a similar interest. But then they fall in love with each other and get married. Clay was thinking that this must be a great day for him, but then he notices that the Van Horns had one of those subscription-based magazines, called 'Cosmopolitan', and with a name like that you always know what to expect - pictures of scantily-clad models, ads for perfume and cosmetic products and articles telling you how to take care of your vagina. He knows from his school days that kids these days are completely ignorant of the workings of the vagina and its many delicate functions. Rebecca is beautiful, of course, but she doesn't even have a vagina, much less the know how to take care of it. And so, there is no wedding. The couple just split up. Clay is left feeling stupid for having been so easily impressed by what he thought would be a perfect match.

Clay pulls the magazine out from the tree and looks at the photos in front of him. It seems like everybody is having a wonderful time except for him and Rebecca. Why is he so upset? He hadn't paid much attention to the magazine before, but the articles in it seem to indicate that the world he lives in is in shambles"," He thought to himself, ""How ironic that the two people whose wedding I'm going to miss the most are both going to get married again! Rebecca will once again get married to that rich jerk Schubert Myers and Rodney will get married again to some guy with an annoying dog called Duke. A small voice in the back of his head asked how this could possibly be ironic and he realised it was his internal monologue suggesting it should be ironic, not himself. He put his head in his hands feeling suddenly very depressed.

Carter then heard a loud thud and looked up to see Rodney laying unconscious on the floor after being brutally attacked by Duke. The pain must have been terrible. There was no question now of going to the Bahamas after all. 

The next morning as Carter was getting ready for work he heard the local news station say they had found a corpse in a field and it was thought to be Rodney. Carter called his friends Bob and Clay to see if they wanted to get a bite to eat. ""I'm on my way,"" Bob replied. ""I'll come with you,"" said Clay. ""That way I can repay you for lending me that expensive suit."" They laughed. As they walked to the diner Bob asked, ""Was the news that you got last night really true?"" ""What do you mean?"" replied Bob. ""A body was found last night and they're saying it's Rodney."" ""That's impossible"," He would take the money they had spent on the magazine and donate it to charity. The following morning Clay went to the newsagent and bought a copy of the magazine as a prank. It was a prank that worked like a charm! The next day on the subway the cover of the magazine was torn in half, the pages with the pictures of the beautiful bride and her family and Clay's ugly mug staring back at him. He felt bad but didn't stop to think what a coincidence it was that a copy of the December cover was in the newsagent bag the day before. The subway ride home was much more enjoyable as Clay started laughing to himself at the ridiculousness of the cover and the way it had played out. Later that night when he was taking a bath he realized the laugh had turned to tears and that the tears were because he had bought the magazine just a few days before. He blamed himself for the sad event and wished he hadn't bought the magazine. The following morning he made a phone call to the newspaper to cancel his subscription.

He loved to research who was dating whom. It was so much more entertaining than the reality. Rebecca Van Horn was not his type at all - she was bookish and boring. He was looking for exciting things like sailing in the Bahamas. 

Rebecca Van Horn knew she was destined to marry a powerful man. Clay was just a mere mortal that could be easily manipulated by an overbearing spouse and children. It was all so obvious! 

One day Clay decided that he would just have to marry a powerful man himself and make his own family powerful too. He thought for a minute as he looked at the pictures of the glitzy weddings in the magazine. He could do it. He'd have to marry a powerful man. It wouldn't be so bad. He had money. His business was growing. He'd have an obedient wife and two well-behaved children that always listened to him. He could teach them not to question his power and how it came to be. He could give them a better life than what he had as a mere mortal. He'd make them into powerful people. It was perfect. 

Clay got onto his computer and typed 'how to marry a powerful man'. He searched through thousands of different resources and found an article on how to achieve what he was after. He studied the techniques, looked at photos of what powerful men looked like and finally he married a powerful man. 

The powerful man was named Robert"
" B. The promise of delivery If you ask for a specific product to be delivered to your doorstep, the promise of delivery (the carrot) may be used to tempt you into buying. C.

" She is reminiscent of D.H. Lawrence, a fact which many will find as a tonic on a hot day. The novel is highly recommended. 

Isabel is not alone in her concern with her appearance - there are legions of women worried about their weight, their facial symmetry, their dress sense etc etc. As in any well-lived life, she should consult a GP and also consider her surroundings, the people she comes into contact with, the culture she inhabits, the economic climate and her aspirations. A good therapist should help but it’s not all in your head! It would be good if the author had also considered the role of advertising. 

The novel is ‘highly recommended’; the plot moves along briskly with good dialogue - but a tad too loud for some - and the author’s wit is evident in the dialogue as well as the characterization. If the author had employed subtitles to clarify the speech, then perhaps more readers would have benefitted.

A good story with some interesting nuances.

B. This is something we can all learn from. We can all put our knobbly knees into perspective as the unlikely heroine of a novel. 

C. How can we put our knobbly knees into perspective? We can look at our knees and remember how knobbly they are or we can remember that we are still human and our knees may indeed be knobbly but they are still our knees which we should feel proud of and not see as a liability. 

D. The lessons from this book are as follows: 

1. Be yourself and chances are you will like who you are. 

2. Wear what you like and don't feel guilty. 

3. Be happy with the way you look and don't let others' opinions about how you look stop you from doing what you want to do. 

E. A great book which any of us can learn from. We can look at our knees and remember how knobbly they are or we can remember that we are still human and our knees may indeed be knobbly but they are still our knees which we should feel proud of and not see as a liability.

Isabel's life is a series of ‘if onlys’ - as when she sits in a cafe and considers that the perfect man might just walk in. However as soon as he actually does appear her ‘if onlys’ turn to ‘how will I know?’ However the book ably deals with this issue through the clever use of narrative voice, the heroine is written with the more direct cadences of a stand-up comic but the final reveal through the eyes of an infant (with the appropriate ‘oh baby’ tagline) is highly amusing.

At its heart is the premise that one shouldn’t judge a book by it’s cover - and equally there are many books which look like this, this one looks especially good as it contains some stunningly vivid imagery (especially the description of a party) and excellent use of setting and interior design. There are some very funny moments through the book, Isabel's voice lends itself to delivery as the comedian she could deliver a good roast in character but would be hopeless at a Shakespearean speech. Some of her quips are unfortunately spot on - for example 'I suppose you could call me a workaholic. My work comes first.’

Whilst not a ‘fast read’ there are times when one’s attention needs to be held on the words on the page - a style which the author delivers very well indeed. The final section is a slightly disappointing teardrop of a romance but thank"," This is a lighthearted romp though its final few chapters are a little dark. The ending was a little unsatisfactory but it does leave one with a spring in the step for the final chapter and a clear appreciation that not everything is as it appears and there is always hope. This is certainly a novel you won’t soon forget.


B. ‘Our heroine appears to be fairly confident.  Her knee statement isn’t totally out of place, actually.  I mean we all get knee’s that are a little iffy but still capable of supporting you.’ So runs the logic of Ben, a reader of the novel. I think I might just be falling for this girl.


C. ‘Our heroine does have a point. As an artist I tend to look a little rough around the edges, I don’t want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.’  And concludes Ben as he finishes the chapter.


D.  ‘Our heroine feels like she just got hit by a bus.  Her knees and stomach literally feel like they were on fire.  In fact, everything does actually feel a bit on fire.’  Comes the diagnostic analysis from another reader of the novel.

B. In the course of the story our heroine, is inspired to purchase a pair of old jeans which she has been hankering after. She subsequently hires a professional to undertake a ‘proper’ tailor made alteration. It does not occur to her that whilst she has been in hibernation (working on her historical romance) her jeans have only shrunk in the wash. The professional tailor is in fact astonished to see the jeans which the heroine returns to her house.

‘So it seems you were not expecting me!’ the heroine exclaims as she plonks herself down on a bar stool opposite the tailor. ‘I thought that jeans shrank in the wash!’ the tailor replies. ‘But they do not!’ Our heroine retorts. ‘These are the same jeans!’ the tailor agrees. ‘Of course they are!’

The tailor invites the heroine to observe the knees of the jeans and to try them on. The heroine complies so that she can have a clearer view and of course to give the tailor a good price. The heroine’s knees are not just knobbly but a complete jumble. ‘Oh dear!’ the heroine exclaims after her third trip to the loo! ‘You will have to spend hundreds of pounds to fix them.’ The tailor concurs but is more than happy to work with the price she has agreed to the heroine.

So too Isabel when a handsome gent accosts her in the street – as he has been following her around the internet – and she runs through a series of responses that includes 'do you dance?' and 'yes, a little'. They agree to meet later and she makes a mental note to ‘practice’. As Hope wryly remarks ‘I could be a dancer. Or I could be a hairdresser’ as their paths cross once more. Is there anyone for whom this book would not provide an entertaining read?

B. The novel is full of intriguing ideas and intriguing details. The chapter headings are a good example: 'Our Heroine Realises She Is Inspired'. The author's choice of ‘knees’ for the word ‘knobbly’ is particularly apt. And a mention at the end of the book of a website, The Inspiration Project, for aspiring dancers and hairdressers may well find a ready market for aspiring dancers and hairdressers. We can’t wait for the sequel and hope that the protagonist will have learnt to dance by then.

" Sleep also contributes to the process of healing from the night before, so that our sleep may serve to rebuild our strength after the exertions of the day.

There are some who go so far as to claim that sleep is simply a way for the brain to recharge its batteries. It purports to enable the repair of damaged neural circuits, the compilation of new knowledge, or the refreshing of ideas previously considered obsolete. 

Finally, there is a fourth theory. It states that sleep is just a form of entertainment. Rather than being a means of repairing our health, repairing our mental strength or even merely recharging our batteries, sleep is an opportunity for us to take a break and recharge our batteries without much need for change. It is said that we lose many hours of sleep to movies, books, music or the news and that our lives are therefore far more enjoyable if we have more rest.

A:

Sleep is a way to replenish your energy.
One of the many functions of sleep is to restore the depleted levels of chemicals in our body through metabolism. As stated by this article

Sleep is a form of energy replenishment, in which our bodies use stored energy while we're asleep.

"," It also believes that sleep is how we recharge our batteries, giving our cells time to recharge their electricity supplies. Finally it maintains that sleep does have a spiritual function, which is in aligning our personal values with the world and in serving as a way of making peace with ourselves. This theory claims that sleep has a role in developing our self-understanding. People who hold a more reductionistic view of sleep believe it is primarily a physiological process. They believe sleep occurs in four specific stages or cycles which are Rest, Slow Wave, REM and then finally the last stage which is where we wake up. These four stages each have their own specialised functions. The Rest Stage is where we switch off, and is important for repairing any damage done during the day. The Slow Wave Stage is where we dream but unfortunately scientists are no closer to understanding what goes on in these dreams. The REM stage is also referred to as ""sleepwalking"". This is where we have vivid dreams and also seem to behave oddly. Finally the Waking Up stage is where we suddenly become aware of what has been happening, whereupon we need to be very careful what we do as our memories of the events of the night before are hazy. The scientific community is divided between those who believe the four stages of sleep have distinct functions and those who believe the stages are simply marks along the path of the sleep cycle. While some of the time in each stage is hard to tell, it appears that the four-stage"," The second theory suggests that our sleep is more about recharging our batteries than providing vital repair and maintenance. This is more akin to a hibernation state, and allows us to focus and recharge our batteries for the next day. The third theory is that sleep is about recreation and entertainment.  It claims that sleep is a moment when we can disengage from the everyday and recharge our batteries by taking stock of where we are in life.  By reviewing our goals and desires we can then focus on and work towards achieving them during the day.  Whatever the reason for going to sleep, one thing is clear, our sleep is for our own benefit, it is not a waste of time.  There is a strong positive correlation between the length of time people sleep and their mental health.  Sleep is therefore another thing which is good for us but not for the reasons we may think.  The research suggests that we can improve our sleep through better diet, getting enough exercise and reducing our screen time.  A good night's rest is definitely worth having, so let the sleep of your life commence.

The main theories about sleep are the following: 
1. Sleep helps the body repair and restores itself.
2. Sleep is about recreation and entertainment.
3. Sleep is for the benefit of the individual.
4. The longer people sleep, the better their mental health.


Which of the following is a sub-theory of the theory about sleep"," The theory is appealing because there is much evidence to support the notion that our bodies greatly benefit from the restoration and repair that sleep can bring about. Many studies have found that sleep is beneficial to a range of systems and processes in our bodies. Our lungs, for example, may need to rest and recover from working during our sleep so that we can breath more efficiently during the day. Our heart, which is responsible for keeping us alive during the day also needs to be ready for action during sleep as we may need to take in air or pump blood around our body. Our digestive system is dependent on the enzymes that occur during sleep in order to help break down food, so that we may absorb more nutrients. The third theory, which enjoys increasing acceptance, states that sleep is, fundamentally, more of a opportunity to rest and relax than it is a function. It is essentially a chance to do nothing rather than something. The advantage of this view is that it offers an explanation of sleep as a choice rather than as a need. In other words, there is no need to take a nap as one can instead choose to sleep if they want to. The theory is becoming especially popular as our pace of life accelerates and the demands on us to be both productive and efficient means that we are often unable to rest and relax the way that our bodies need to do so. Despite this, many of the processes and functions of our bodies are aided by sleep. These include our respiratory system, digestive system and cognitive"," Second theory suggests that sleep serves no other function than to allow people to switch off and avoid awareness of what is happening around them. This theory is based on the work of William James and Edward Abbott. The idea is that sleep creates a “privacy screen” so that people can safely turn down their awareness for a while. A more recent and less popular theory is the “winding down” theory. The idea is that as we sleep our nervous system gradually unwinds the tangle of neural networks weaved through throughout the day. This theory also claims that sleep is primarily beneficial. However it is more similar to the first theory than the others. In summary, scientists are far from being in agreement about the functions of sleep. However this uncertainty and the lack of agreed upon evidence leads scientists to disagree.

  The most popular states that the functions and purposes of sleep are primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body.

  It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. There seem to be three main theories. The most popular states that the functions and purposes of sleep are primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. In other words biological processes work hard as we sleep to repair any damage done during the day and to restore ourselves"," This theory however has been questioned by those who believe sleep to have an entirely non-physical function. It is suggested that our bodies release endorphins during sleep which provides a natural pain-killer and helps us to sleep soundly. This second theory of course has been questioned by those who believe sleep to have an entirely physical function. Here it is suggested that sleep is primarily a means of regenerating brain cells and repairing those which are damaged during the day. This third theory does not offer an explanation for the physiological functions of sleep. It assumes these to be essentially non-existant. However as there do appear to be real physiological benefits to be had from sleep, scientists are not prepared to rule this theory out.

It's claimed that the process of sleep allows us to put our minds in a state of reduced alertness so that we can enjoy calm and restorative surroundings. 
These claims are controversial and remain in debate. There is evidence for all three theories and against each. There is evidence that the effects of sleep might differ from person to person.  Evidence for physiological effects, such as better cardiovascular health and reduced diabetes risk. There is evidence that sleep might not be as restful as the brain of the individual would wish. There is evidence that many parts of our bodies actually need more sleep than we get and that many parts of our bodies wake up during sleep. 
Some people do not agree with the need for sleep. They argue that the physical and emotional benefits of being asleep are worth the expense. 

Sleep is important but not for all people. There are those who do not require sleep. They might be healthier without it. There are those for whom sleep interferes with work or with socialising. There are those who sleep a lot but have poor sleep quality. 
Theories aside, we do know that sleep appears to occur in stages or wakings. The individual is either awake or asleep in each stage. The phases of sleep include: Stages 1 and 2 (S1 and S2) where the body is awake but not fully active.

" Ergonomist: This office is not healthy. It lacks natural light, and there is very little in terms of task variety. The furniture is uncomfortable and the people are slouching all over the place, with many people using their phones excessively. Occupational Psychologist: This is a very unhealthy environment, the air in the office is dirty and there is too much noise and stress. All of the occupants are using their phones far too much. It is hard to think clearly in this office and they all appear to be suffering from stress. This is not a healthy environment and could do with some basic improvements.

The research is not new but it is certainly a revelation that how much of an impact the physical environment, specifically the interior design, has on employee wellbeing. The research is led by the University of California Berkeley. The research was conducted between August and October 2014 and had a representative sample of 567 participants across four different offices. Two of the offices were research offices where academics conduct their research and they have the following requirements for their offices:

The Berkeley rooms (which we visited) provide the ideal environment for conducting original research in an open and well-ventilated room with natural light. The Berkeley rooms were built to California Building standards. While they provide everything you need for conducting your research, they also have thoughtful features to make the space feel like a co-working space – for example, we have a couch that you can use to kick back during breaks and coffee and"," We also noted that the view across the park was a nice distraction from the all the office commotion. Office B. Accountancy Firm We encountered an open plan space with all members of staff actively at work; one can’t help but feel it is a happy space. The view from the window and the coffee machine is certainly a bonus, but it is a space that functions well. We noted that the space was very bright and there was plenty of natural light. Office C. Software Company The space is minimal with the exception of a large open plan space with lots of collaborative whiteboards and plenty of space for all team members to contribute. We noticed the whiteboards had notes on employee satisfaction and a project plan for the upcoming quarter. They were very active and clearly inspired by their environment. Office D. Engineering Company Excellent space. Beautiful views across the rooftops of Canary Wharf but with modern office furniture and a very active team. We noticed the team were making changes to a 3D modelling application, with lots of group discussions and multiple handouts for colleagues. They appeared well-rested, enthusiastic and clearly very happy at their workspace. We spoke to the team about their space and one member said it felt very ‘homey’ and that it had plenty of natural light and a great view.

In this modern office there are no obvious signs of physical activity taking place other than the occasional conference call; so this is a very quiet office. Office C. Software House: This space does not look very healthy; there are dirty coffee cups on the desks and the whole place smells of cigarette smoke. It appears that this is a young, inexperienced team who have not yet experienced the benefits of working in a clean, comfortable and healthy environment. The occupants of this space appear to be struggling and their wellbeing is clearly low. Office D. IT Company: This office has clean, modern workspaces with high-quality furniture.

The airy feel of the space and neutral colour palette are pleasing and very conducive to concentration and happiness. The team members in this office report that this is one of the most beautiful places they have ever worked. It is very unusual to find a corporate office that is this healthy and happy.

From paternity B. Because of the above reason I have decided to leave the theatre. My personal life has been a disappointment to me and I have not fulfilled my potential. 

From here to paternity A. I was not aware of B's existence until I got home yesterday. I will miss the theatre, the people and being surrounded by beautiful books and music.


I would also like to add that my three children have grown up knowing their father and love him dearly, and I am sure that was partly why I decided to leave. They mean the world to me and will always be my main focus, however now they also know a father who isn't the worst parent in the world. For that I am very grateful.


Regards

Dad


P.S. I have attached a picture of my children who you can see in the attached document (if you can understand what I wrote). Please tell them I'm sorry I had to leave them.


P.P.S. Sorry about the email. My phone just recently broke. My apologies.


Hi Dolly. I've attached the final document from my lawyer. Please let me know what you think. I think this is a fair deal for both parties. 

With lots of love, 

Philippe


Hi Philippe. 

I love the final proposal from your lawyer. 

My suggestion is that you get a lawyer who specializes in will"," I feel blessed.

The narrator might want to pause and have the narrator’s spouse provide their view on the passage:


The narrator’s spouse feels That because of his bizarre personal life which he cannot be proud of, Mr. A has been blessed with 35 years of small children and can honestly say he has loved every minute. Mr. A has the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning, and that for Mr. A is what being a father is all about. Mr. A feels Mr. A is terribly lucky with his children. They all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. Mr. A feels it creates a great bond especially now that they are mostly grown up and Mr. A has become a friend rather than a father. Mr. A feels Mr. A feels Mr. A is blessed.


At this point the narrator can move on to the next passage:


From here to paternity B. To be a father is to have the pleasure of feeding the baby, to love every minute, to create a bond with your children, to feel blessed. There is nothing like being a father. 

It can be helpful to show the passage to a friend or two to get their two cents’s on what they think might make it a good passage. After all, parents of course view parenting in a different way than, for example, a healthcare professional or educational administrator. But the sentiment is mostly one shared by most"," I remember this time well and would like to share this story with you. 

Because of the time difference I was lucky to get an email just before midnight informing me that I was pregnant. It arrived at our apartment in Geneva, Switzerland. We went to bed full of joy at this new development, but the excitement soon waned when I awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of a vacuum cleaner that was in our bedroom. I threw on my running shoes and raced down the stairs to see what the clatter was all about. In the end of our hallway stood our four month old baby, completely bald with a small blue bow tie on her head. We were happy to know we would have a baby but the realisation that it had landed in the vacuum cleaner at our apartment came as quite a shock. 

I rushed back up the stairs and into our bedroom, where I threw our unborn daughter into a far corner of the bed. I then went running back down the stairs and called an old friend who was staying at the nearby hotel.  The friend had just finished watching a movie on Netflix.  She knew exactly how to proceed.  She knew how to handle this situation.  She said “Well you tell me where the baby is and I’ll give her a bath”. I did not understand what she was talking about so I asked. She proceeded to tell me exactly how to proceed with the bath, where the baby was and even what I"," I also love art and have exhibited my paintings in several galleries, but sadly my art never sold. I’d love to have sold my paintings to buy a boat like those rowers in the movie The Hundred-Foot Journey did, but instead I am a father and live the life of a local squire. I have a stable job as a surgeon with the British Medical Association and my children and I regularly travel to a few of the wonderful locations around the world where we visit on a yearly basis. Because my personal life is so bizarre I like to keep that part of my life private and my children are no exception and do not discuss their father. For their part they just know that they love their big and wonderful Papa who has always taken them on all the adventures we have done. On a more personal note my favourite part of being a father is watching my children grow day by day into young adults who are so different from me. They are now in their late twenties and thirties and it’s lovely to see the children you raised eventually become men. I hope they know how lucky they are to have a dad who adores them and has the means to take them on all the adventures we have done. As an aside it is nice to know that they were able to get a babysitter for their upcoming birthday party at the Royal Opera House in Coventry. I can’t tell you how many mothers have been able to get a babysitter to bring their children to"," I’ve also worked hard to bring them up to be independent women and men without the typical patriarchal assumptions that are still so prevalent in society today. I am just glad I was able to provide a stable home for my kids and am thrilled that I was able to continue creating great art throughout these years.


From here to parenthood B. Although I am now a father there are aspects of motherhood that I’ve yet to experience. My children are still growing and developing and I am thrilled that they have a stable home with their mother but it leaves me behind. I’m afraid that at any moment they could be transported away from me and I would not know what it would be like to be a single father. I live in fear that they might not be getting the guidance, love and support from their mother that they need. Even if my kids and I still live under the same roof I am afraid that they will never really have my undivided attention. As a matter of fact I am so worried about that that I have begun to question my own capabilities as a father. All I want is for them to know who and where they came from. I have made the conscious decision that if I am ever going to be able to be a good father to them I will need to be able to dedicate more time to parenting than I have in the past.


From here to parenthood C. I now have my own family consisting of my wife, myself"," They know that when I am tired or going to the store they can call me father.

"

The session itself was fine, as hypnotherapy tends to be, but my colleague was quite unsympathetic. I realised as we filed out of the room that she had not realised she was holding a cigarette. This did not stop her from saying that I was a disgrace and that I had let myself and my patients down. This made me feel angry and resentful, which did not improve my motivation for stopping smoking, which I admit was initially weak. Then things went wrong, as they often do.

I had left a cigarette in my jacket pocket and on the train home I realised I needed to find it. As I approached the packet-a-day lady I realised I had left it in the pocket of my jacket. I was quite upset at this moment and the subsequent discovery that I had left my cigarettes alone on the train was another minor episode, which made me feel much worse.

I realised I had better find them before dark and returned home where I smoked one in a futile attempt to find them. However, the cigarette had gone out and I was now left with a lit cigarette, my jacket, my packet of 20, and an assortment of matches which had miraculously survived the journey. I was feeling pretty shaky at this point.

In frustration I wandered around my house looking for the cigarette and eventually found the packet in one of my other jacket pockets. This meant I also needed to find the matches, which were all over the place"," I was happy with my cigarette consumption. When I became a smoker I gave it up for a variety of reasons including the health risks, the damage they caused to my lungs, and the fact that I no longer wanted to. I thought I would give it two or three weeks and then one day I just stopped. In the short space of time since I have noticed some odd and significant changes to my smoking behavior, and the most surprising change is the feeling of peace and relaxation I now get whenever I smoke. I feel as though I can breathe more freely, and that, along with an increase in mood and energy, has convinced me that there is nothing inherently positive about smoking. I feel a little lost as I try to explain why I gave it up and I would be grateful for any advice fellow smokers might have.

THE REASON YOU GAVE UP SMOKING

Smoking is addictive. I became a heavy smoker for a number of reasons, including the fact that smoking was socially acceptable, available and reasonably cheap, but equally I enjoyed the nicotine rush. I loved the way they tasted. Each one was a surprise, a surprise I didn’t quite realize until I had inhaled it all. I also found that when I was smoking I relaxed and felt less anxious, more energetic and generally more content. I thought that this combination meant I was consuming less harmful chemicals, but in actual fact I was actually damaging my lungs in the process. I began to understand"," In fact it was the prospect of spending a considerable amount of money, hundreds of pounds if memory serves me correctly, on something that was very tempting, not just financially, but personally too. My colleague did not see the point and I was very much an afterthought as I have no one to stop-smoke for.  

When I first thought about quitting I was astonished that it was possible. It was the 1950s and the idea of quitting smoking seemed ridiculous. The idea of having to relit my only cigarette immediately afterwards appeared impossible. After all, what would be the point? I certainly did not intend to go the whole day without a smoke - I was never one for long-term cessation.  

I realised that by not smoking I was not only improving my health but also protecting my lungs which had undoubtedly been damaged from years of inhaling secondhand smoke.  

In that first hour of not smoking everything became clear. I realised I could not afford to continue smoking so I would have to stop, there would be no second cigarette and I would not be able to light one immediately afterwards because this would destroy the hypnosis. In the first few hours of not smoking, I lost my fear of stopping. I knew I would not be able to smell my cigarette. 

I spent the following months without a cigarette and it was an extremely pleasurable experience. I did feel slightly guilty afterwards because I was missing a cigarette but I felt very"," I was, to be blunt, bored with the whole idea. However, I did stop and I’m delighted to report that I am no longer a smoker. Not that the colleague was so impressed. ‘That just goes to show,’ she hissed, ‘that’s one addiction that can never be overcome.’  - Flesch Kincaid Grade Scale

  * Grade 2: 5.5

  * Objective: The text describes how one afternoon she gave up smoking, an idea that had never occurred to her. However, she then went on to say that one addiction that could never be overcome was her colleague's smoking.
  * Critical Reading: The text gives an example of how one afternoon one became a non-smoker two months and three weeks later. This is interesting because it demonstrates the temporary nature of breaking a habit.
  * Comprehension: The author describes a session where she stopped smoking. This text is interesting for students because it suggests that habits are harder to kick than they first seem. After all, it took two months and three weeks for the author to no longer be a smoker.

She claimed that it could never be over come. Could you think of any habits that can never"," I would certainly not have said that giving up smoking was easy. However, I found it just didn’t feel like an issue any more. To be honest, I felt pretty good about that. It’s now almost a year since I gave up and I haven’t missed a cigarette. That sounds like a really bad answer but in truth it feels like quite a small achievement. That’s because the CEFR scale notes that a notable difference in a learner’s behaviour is a six month lag between the start of ‘change’ and the CEFR note. In this instance, the CEFR note mentions that I am ‘No longer a daily smoker’ but it doesn’t explain why. I am still not sure I actually understand what has happened. I do know that one colleague has stopped smoking, one colleague does not accept my cigarettes any more and the rest I suspect is just waiting to explode. It is possible that I am due a CEFR note some time in 2023. That would be a shame. It is certainly going to be fun being an expert on me. As well as knowing the exact number of packets of cigarettes I smoked every day, I will also have to explain exactly what happened that afternoon, when did I stop, why I stopped, and whether that’s a particularly large or small achievement. That could be fun. 
Although a significant difference in attitude, behaviour or performance is a six-month lag, many learners experience ‘change"," But somehow, I did stop and I’m not actually a smoker any more. That’s life. I’m still here. It’s a tiny miracle, don’t you think? In the end, it was actually the hypnotherapist who stopped me. He was so convincing that after a while I actually believed I was going to die. In the event, my life was not disrupted or even much altered. I continued to do my job and to see friends and family, although at times I was concerned about this odd taste in my mouth. I can still taste the bitter tang of a cigarette. But I’m not a smoker any more and that’s the important thing. It really is.


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale measures reading difficulty in terms of words, words per sentence, and sentence length. Using the following formula, the total words in the passage above would be:  total words = (total sentences * sentences per total sentences) + 1


The total words, words per sentence, and sentence length from the above passage are as follows:

total sentences = 18 total words words per sentence = 3 sentences = 18 total words

Given these calculations, the total words in the above passage are estimated to be between 11 and 16.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale was created in 1965 by researcher Dr Robert L. Flesch, a professor of speech at New"," The idea had seemed like a good one and, as one does, I had started the journey. 
  
I suppose I should have stopped earlier. A year ago, when I was having a particularly bad week, I picked up a packet on the M4 on the way home from work, just for a laugh. It wasn’t until two months ago that I was reminded of just how bad I had been. I arrived home from work to an angry email from my boss. A ‘career decision’ and a ‘personal one’ it read; no explanations or excuses and I was out the door as soon as possible. 
  
My brother, who had always smoked and was now retired, was initially supportive and sent a box of cigarettes, which I duly opened and promptly put out of my mind. I started the day with coffee and a cigarette, which was pleasant but I wasn’t feeling too well so I switched to a smaller amount of cigarette. Then I realised the clock was ticking and I had a choice between ending my nicotine-based addiction or spending the rest of the day doubled over, feeling sick and wondering, yet again, why I was not happier. 
  
There were no rules that I knew of about when to quit. I did know that my last cigarette had been two hours and five minutes before work on the morning of the day I started the ‘stop-smoking session’, yet somehow it had not really registered. On a lark"
" The computer does not discipline the brain in the way that writing by hand does. 

To give yourself a better chance of finishing a task, first break it down into smaller chunks. For instance, you could break down working on your essay into the following small chunks:

1. Identifying the topic
2. Deciding on a strong thesis statement
3. Developing your strong thesis statement into a main idea
4. Developing your main idea into a supporting idea
5. Developing your supporting ideas into a conclusion
6. Editing and polishing your conclusion

By breaking your essay up into smaller chunks, you'll spend less time trying to remember everything you need to do. And you'll spend more time on the enjoyable part - writing the essay!

#AskSally

Do you write by hand or by computer? 

Handwriting is much more difficult than typing, so I would prefer to type my essays!

I was surprised at how few crossed-out my school essays were. The physical difficulty of handwriting taught my brain to pay attention to each sentence. Without that brain discipline, I would have re-written most of them five times.

I don't understand why it is not possible to write carefully on a computer. I would prefer to write on a physical paper that I then type up!

I would recommend writing an essay first by hand, and then transferring it to a computer by taking screenshots and past"," We learn to write ‘for now’ rather than ‘then’. In due course the brain will become ‘for good’. 

Writing with care involves many elements. A person’s style of writing is one element; the context in which writing occurs is another; the medium itself has its own particular properties, its own idiosyncrasies. Some of the idiosyncrasies of the computer relate to punctuation which is the most prominent of the means by which the text is divided into individual words and sentences. Computer-generated texts often contain fewer hyphens than those of writers using a manual typewriter for example. There are other subtle differences but the main one is that in the latter case the punctuation is set by the machine whereas in the former case the writer corrects it before typing it. In a wordprocessor the text is corrected by the computer and therefore, for a user, the distinction between written and typed text disappears. The writer must then adapt their own punctuation to the computer punctuation. 

The medium’s own idiosyncrasies may require the writer to employ a specialised convention or to alter their own conventions in specific ways. This may mean, for example, that a colon is preceded by a semi-colon rather than a full stop because the latter is typed by the computer in the same way as a full stop. Other idiosyncrasies are more obvious but nevertheless require specific treatment. The automatic insertion of a semicolon at"," The time to complete a written piece is reduced, yet the quality may well suffer. It is the combination of time pressure and the desire to get it right that causes the most error and the greatest decline in quality. 

The modern computer keyboard and ‘mouse’ provide a means to discipline the fingers – one that has the side benefit of eliminating the need to wear fine motor skills while typing. Yet, our modern computer usage seems to result in text that is rushed and formulaic. This seems to be connected to the loss of manual precision in typing. My students are all reading material for work and many of them are required to write weekly essays. When I evaluate the material that is submitted to me by my students it often shocks me at how formulaic their content is. As a teacher I want the essays that I assign to be compelling and interesting, yet in today’s technology driven environment students often are expected to merely fill in the gaps of the content with relevant keywords and phrases to generate a passable essay. They do not fully explore the topics, nor do they learn the nuances of the ideas they are exploring.

I am seeking to replace my handwritten and printed school essay materials with computer generated materials that encourage the student to fully explore the topic and fully understand the ideas. I also seek to ensure that the students are allowed to fully understand the topic and explore the ideas with a minimum of time constraints.


Computer based texts provide an avenue to reduce the time of writing"," This is the lesson the Flesch Kincaid Scale of Readability identifies. It measures the amount of ‘effort’ required to understand the content of a text compared to the effort required to read it. An eye-catching example of the application of this scale in the real world is its use by Amazon.com to measure the readability of book summaries published on the internet.

Flesch Kincaid devised the scale in 1974 and has refined it in a number of subsequent editions, including one in 2008 which includes the option of reporting data for different document types. The latest editions are intended for a broad audience including those without an educational or professional background in statistics or reading level guidelines. In contrast to previous editions, the 2008 edition introduces a ‘normal text’ option that can be selected when the Flesch Kincaid reading level scale is used to report on documents in the ‘teaching’ domain (e.g. text produced for students by educational institutions). This new feature allows users to compare documents written by non-native speakers in different languages.

The following graph shows the Flesch Kincaid reading level scores achieved by documents in various categories. Two groups of documents are immediately apparent in the graph; those with a low score and those with a relatively high score. The low score documents include news articles, government reports, technical manuals and academic theses. The high score documents include encyclopaedias and professional guides to topics"," The CEFR text is in contrast a written effort. It includes text, images and videos. Unlike the handwritten text, it is not the author's responsibility to correct errors. The CEFR has rules for punctuation, spelling, layout and grammar. The rules are there to keep the text machine-readable and in some cases may seem pedantic to an author. To avoid being an obstruction to the text itself, rules are easy to overlook. The CEFR text demands a high standard of writing. The rule against the use of abbreviations and acronyms may appear cumbersome. What the CEFR covers are the abbreviations and acronyms used in the profession of education itself. In the UK the full name of the Department for Education, for instance, is the 'Department for Education and Employment'. Using this name in an article would surely not be acceptable. The CEFR has some guidance here. Using the full name 'Department for Education and Employment' might be a compromise but avoiding the acronym DFE in favour of 'DfE' would certainly be incorrect. An example of an acceptable use of the acronym might be ‘Department for Education and the Arts’. The acronym DfE has its place in written discourse, but it is not the place for abbreviations used by education professionals in the UK. The guidance does not address abbreviations used in UK education organisations overseas. While it is not possible to have an exhaustive list of accepted abbreviations"," While it is important to avoid typos, it is also important to avoid the typos that can arise from sloppiness. 

This is an excellent example of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale being helpful in determining the physical difficulty of writing and avoiding the risk of typos arising from sloppiness.

"," Computer technology has transformed communication in a fundamental way.

There are still those who write by hand, though fewer than ever. Many will maintain that handwriting is beautiful. I find it hard to write by hand as I am impatient with the process of discipline. I find it easier to write by hand with a computer. My parents learnt to write by hand, and we still write by hand, but I have not inherited their hand or my mother’s beautiful calligraphy. My mother used to tell us that the secret of beautiful handwriting was to take your time. This I could do, so I wrote with care. I do not have her elegant and flowing script but I manage to convey my thoughts clearly. Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard.

There are, as I write, many people who read my words and consider me intelligent or insightful. It’s true that many of my written words are direct reports of my thought processes. Sometimes when a thought process is difficult to verbalise, or I’ve forgotten what I meant, I will write things down to remember what I said or what I meant, so that I can remember and understand better. I write these down in an attempt to clarify my meaning.

The computer allows the ability to record, playback and annotate. It has revolutionised knowledge capture and knowledge management. There are many applications of"

The streetlights along the avenue were amber dips in the overcast which lent my trek an artificial lightness as I went with confidence down the middle of the street. There were two lanes which were bordered by curbside shrubbery which kept them private from the sidewalk yet accessible to passers by from across the street. I paused to watch a woman on the sidewalk cross at a junction of the crosswalk and the curb with her bicycle, her long skirt swirling in the breeze, the lights dancing in her eyes. I paused to watch a group of teenagers on motorcycles bounce down the curb lane in pursuit of an errant ball while honking and singing at each other, their slick black clothing slicked by the wet concrete on either side. I sped up, my feet slapping at the wet pavement as I moved through the intersection. When I was sure I had a clean route, I started looking for another adventure, and I wondered, as I turned down the next street, where my next adventure would be.

When I was younger, on a visit to Florida, we were staying with my family at our cabin on the coast. The night was still and humid and I had not yet begun to feel uncomfortable in the humidity. I was just finishing my dinner and contemplating the menu for the evening when I heard a man scream for help. I turned from the table just in time to see a large alligator come out of the lake into","

Soon Philadelphia Avenue reached its dead end and I arrived at the park at the end of the street. Anticipating the trees and shrubbery and benches and gazebo that I knew were here, I walked to the front gate of the park and held my breath. A child sat on the grass nearby and I bent over her, talking in a whisper, her mother standing nearby as attentive but not touching the child. From this distance it was obvious that the child was not mine. Still I talked to her and she smiled and burped loudly.

Returning to the dead end of Philadelphia Avenue, I went along the street’s other edge until I found a space between the houses in the park which gave me a clear view of the street and the houses beyond. I crept along the fence behind the houses until I could see the far side of the street, now beginning to light up with streetlamps. I waited until the light had faded across the street. It was a small comfort that the street was relatively empty on this side as there was a park across from each house and usually many children in the park, running, walking slowly or sitting and reading or playing with blocks.

But this was not so on this night, now that I was able to see, because the street had been dark and the houses dark with windows darkly curtained save for the lamps which lighted up the windows as I watched. I waited until the street"," I can now picture many of these houses on the left as number 24 Philadelphia Avenue.

My dad’s office building, which was where I would spend afternoons when I was a boy and which my family then rented from the Matzes for my sister and me to grow up in was on the right side of the street. It was on this side of the street that the first murder took place on April 22, 1976, when an ex-Marine named Ronald Cotton killed his wife of nine years, Lourdes Cotton. I read about this in The New York Times on April 30, 1986. Lourdes died of the blows she sustained to the head, but Ronald Cotton fled the scene without reporting the crime. He was given a suspended sentence and a year’s probation. When the Matzes became concerned about the way he was carrying on, they asked my father to try to persuade him to seek professional help. My dad did this, and Ronald Cotton was ultimately killed in a drive-by shooting by an in-law of the Cotton’s when he was a teenager. 

The Philadelphia Avenue side of the street, although not every household was known to me by name, held many of my earliest memories. This is the side of the street where my parents and my sister and I grew up, and where my sister was murdered. I live in the house on that side of the street and take that route to my house.

This part of the"," The rain had not been a problem as a small child on this side of the street, the gutters were full of leaves in fall and the rain had just washed them away.

I was born in 1955 and was in the early years of walking at age six, which for me was around three years. I had a guide book to Philadelphia Avenue and an adult neighbor who took me there on walks, Mrs. Matz. I would watch her through the window as I waited for her on the front step. She was in her early 50s then and still looked spritely enough to have a teenager’s crush on. I had been a few years behind her and the Matzes and Mrs. Matz were the best of friends and she would take me on her walks. I think they must have felt like a second family for her as I know I would ask the questions all kids ask when they are in new surroundings, “Who lives there?”, and the answer was the Matzes. “Where is their house?”, “Which side of the street is it on?”, I would ask and the answer was, “They live across the street on the other side.” My guide book confirmed this by noting the cross street, which was the Pottses’ property on the other side of the street.

Mrs. Matz would bring me home in the late summer and I remember the Pottses’ driveway and side gate with the huge tall evergreen on"," The gutters, though, the way the sky above them was perpetually grayer than that of the buildings above and the drizzle thickening and the street itself, this street with it’s brick and stone and broken-glass windows, its cobblestones and broken pavement and holes in the asphalt, it all seemed unchanging enough to have been here from the beginning of time. How different, I think to some of my friends on the other side of the street! They had a sense of history that I had never perceived in the tenements, no sense of a past that seemed already as distant as the stars. The houses on the even side of the street, the other side of Philadelphia Avenue, were still occupied, still lived in by people from my childhood who would see me and wave or call out. I had a friend, Joan Hanley; she was my age, a junior at P.S. 56. I remember her telling me once that on the even side of the street lived a cat named Charlie. I was eager to visit her house, hoping perhaps to find Charlie there. I knew his name, after all, but I also knew how very hard it could be to find a missing friend; I had missed many a day from school because of an absence or two that lingered longer than most. I did not know, though, that Charlie and her family had left the even side of Philadelphia Avenue months before and returned only long after I had turned eleven"," These little troughs my parents had poured into the cracks to cover them up. My parents to this day had denied my knowledge of their purpose though even I had learned to use one in high school as a drinking vessel and was able to deduce its function at the time. Philadelphia Avenue from end to end, I was unceremoniously drenched twice. The drizzle had also muddied my vision though no longer than a few moments this impeded as I struggled over an embedded stick that had fallen from a neighbor’s yard. After a few seconds of trying to push the stick out I’d resigned to the inevitable and with a shrug of my shoulders had stepped over it. As I neared the corner, there it was, on the sidewalk, a half dozen steps behind me. One by one, Philadelphias rolled up and trundled along the empty street one after the other. They made a loud mechanical noise as they locked their brakes and seemed to look at me with curiosity as they passed. I had reached the corner after another few seconds but as I turned to walk the other way I saw the stick a few feet behind me. I turned back to the corner to resume my trek, and as I did so, a little voice within me screamed, “watch out!” It was still there, right where I’d seen it just moments before, but as I took those few steps back, I looked down and the stick was gone.

","
I knew this street as I knew myself; a mélange of sensation and memory in a perpetual process of revision and accretion. My feet crunched on the tar of the road. The drizzle had turned to rain, a drizzle that turned to a downpour by the time I had passed the Pottses’. It pummelled my shoulders and plastered my hair to the sides of my face but I was not deterred, the storm lent me a child-like certainty that I could do this, that I would not slip and fall.
The street was lined with beautiful old houses. Some of the homes had old growth trees that leaned over the streets, some houses had ivy climbing up the outside of them, some had awnings or pergolas that shaded areas of the block. I walked the length of this block often as I got older, I would sit on the steps of one of the houses, the one at the corner of the street. I had a sister but my family was spread far and wide across the continent and I never went into our home, which was often empty, I spent most of my time here with the Matzes and the Pritchard. I was close to my childhood home, close to the places of my learning and imagination and my sadness, but in many ways, I was an outsider there. The Matzes and the Pritchard and the Kring and the Pottses and the Pritchard"
" One man, born in 1879, changed the course of history when he proposed that these forces were not independent but acted upon each other. His ‘constants’ or fundamental physical relationships had a profound impact on the way physicists view our universe. Through the equations he devised it was possible to show that the speed of light was not a constant but actually depended on the amount of energy with which light was generated and that light itself had a mass.  Einstein’s genius lay in seeing that these ideas would lead to profound implications for our understanding of physics.  Einstein realised that space and time themselves were not absolute and constant constructs as Newton had believed, but rather that they were linked. This was a radical idea at the time. Time is a fourth dimension and space is three dimensional. It goes against our intuition. Einstein showed that the space between events was a third entity which he named “spacetime”. His “equations” could be reduced to a single equation, which he called the “field equation” or the “Einstein’s field equation”, an equation that describes how the strength of a particular type of field varies as a function of the “positions” of the particles that create this field. This was one of the most important mathematical discoveries in the history of science.

In the equation he had shown that the speed of light was not a constant but actually depended on the amount of energy with which light was generated. Light itself had a mass.

In 1916,"," Albert Einstein challenged this approach, arguing that it was incomplete. He said that even the gravity between two masses was not an idealisation, but rather a messy consequence of the warping of space and time caused by mass. He also argued that space and time themselves had a subtle yet fundamental relationship with gravity and the other forces of nature. According to relativity, gravity is not an independent force but rather one of the manifestations of the warping of the fabric of space-time caused by mass. He proposed a theory that was counterintuitive to most people’s understanding of gravity: that gravity is not a force, but a warped form of space and time. This radical idea completely changed our understanding of the world. It inspired people to come up with even more outlandish ideas like the existence of miniature worlds outside of our solar system, planets that orbited stars in the Milky Way but were not part of our galaxy. Einstein’s theory of relativity challenged conventional thinking and was at the root of this intellectual revolution. To this day, the theory of relativity is still debated by scientists, with many preferring to stick to Newton’s laws of motion and gravity, the so-called ‘classical’ approach. The name of Einstein also carries connotations of genius or intellect in the western world. In India the name of Jagadish Chandra Bose (1858-1941) who introduced the theory of Relativity in Indian Science is most widely known. Einstein was not a scientist in the", At first these relationships were represented by equations that were complex and difficult to interpret. This led to a search for a more simple and abstract way of representing the same relationships. These led to the idea of indeterminacy. At this stage we can know a relationship but it is still unclear what exactly it is or exactly how it works. The two most famous equations of this era are the Schrodinger equation and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The Schrodinger equation was created in 1926 by Christian Schrodinger during his research at the University of Zurich and is used to describe the behaviour of atoms and electrons. He considered that the wave function of a system represented the complete set of facts about the system and that the physical state of the system could be described by a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the system. The equation also describes the time evolution of the wave function and gives the probability of finding the physical state of the system.  The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle was also created in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg who also worked at the University of Zurich. It says that there is an intrinsic limit to the knowledge that we have of the position and velocity of an object due to the amount of energy we have to apply to measure these quantities. This has led to the concept of ‘uncertainty’ which describes the degree of ignorance we have about a particular quantity. Uncertainty can also be thought of as the range of possible values for a particular quantity. Heisenberg’s," Their ideas coalesced in 1905 with Albert Einstein's development of his two famous equations E=mc2 and G=1/v2. Einstein’s equations, which state that E = (energy) = (mass) x ( acceleration), and G = 1/v2, became the foundational for the special and general theory of relativity. Relativity, despite its complex maths, revolutionised our perception of the universe, space, time and gravity. It also brought together the two great intellectual movements of the century - the scientific rationalisation of the universe brought about by the Greeks and the Christian notion of creation brought about by the Renaissance. Einstein’s theories brought together two ancient and seemingly contrary philosophies. In his later years, he was haunted by a profound thought - if the universe was revealed to be the creation of man, there was a chance that it would be perceived as a superstitious entity rather than the marvel that it is. So whilst he remained a devout Jew, Einstein left the religion. Einstein’s equations opened the possibility of considering that energy and mass can be interrelated. His equations demonstrated that mass and energy are equivalent and this was revolutionary. His equations changed our thinking about the nature of mass and energy and changed our perception of the nature of space and time and the way in which objects and bodies behave. In short, his equations revolutionised our understanding of space, time, energy, mass, gravity and the universe. His equations changed science, and"," Einstein’s approach was to look at the way objects responded to forces and tried to create a universal law that described the relationship between gravity, light and electricity in an unified way. The way he saw it, there had to be a force of gravitation that governed all these different interactions. His revolutionary insight was to look at the way light behaved in a gravitational field and realised that there was an equivalent ‘relativity of light’. As a result, the force of gravity was seen to be just an illusion. Einstein's theory brought together gravity, light and electricity in an entirely new way and transformed our understanding of these three basic interactions. The theory of relativity had two pillars. The first was his argument that mass and energy were equivalent. That all objects, whether large or small, had equal capacity to exert force. A heavy weight exerted equal force as a light one. The second pillar related to gravity. It was based on his observation that light only travelled at a constant speed when it was passing through a gravitational field, slower the closer the observer was getting. Einstein's theory proposed that gravity was not the rigid force it had previously been thought to be, and that instead objects actually fell at their own rate. It was his revolutionary discovery that gravity was not a force acting 'down' on things in the universe, but a field that all objects 'inhabited' that caused space to bend around them. For Albert Einstein, relativity was an attempt to unify forces in a way that was both"," They wanted to describe the physical world in mathematical terms and the old Aristotelian world view was challenged. Relativity Theory was one of the biggest ideas to emerge from this movement and went against everything we are used to. Einstein described time and space differently in such a way that light was affected and travelled faster than the speed of sound. The implications of this were bizarre and run counter to what we see every day and they’ve never fully made sense.

Einstein was born on April 18, 1879 in Berlin, Germany. He was a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Zurich and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1955. During his working life he published over 1,000 papers. He is regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time and is widely considered to be one of the most significant contributors to the field of relativity. He is the namesake of the Special Theory of Relativity and General Theory of Relativity. He is also the namesake of a space ship called 'Albert Einstein', although the spaceship never flew, although it did make a very slow orbit around the Earth. His house in Switzerland has been recognised by Unesco as a World Heritage site.


General relativity is a theory that describes the physical reality of the Universe in mathematical terms and is a huge leap forward in scientific thinking an intellectual revolution that heralded the birth of twentieth century science.


Einstein, who was born in 1879, was awarded the"," The most famous example of this is the theory of Relativity which was created by Albert Einstein in the years 1915 to 1925.  

Einstein’s theories set in motion the development of quantum theory, the atom theory, the general theory of relativity and many other aspects of modern physics. He came up with a new way to look at physics and created a new way to understand the universe. 

Einstein’s theories are considered as revolutionary and have transformed our understanding of space and time. He was a man of faith but what this produced was the most mature, intellectual and profound philosophical system of his day.
  
His theories were considered as profound and bizarre at the time but his genius saw them through to logical conclusions. His theories have stood the test of time and have had a significant impact on human thinking. 

Many of his original ideas and concepts still appear in modern scientific thinking. Although he did not intend this he was a truly original thinker. As a famous advert with Einstein on TV says, ‘He showed the way to a world of certainty.’ 

Einstein was very modest and very hard-working. He had an almost fanatical determination to solve the mystery of the universe. His theories led to great advances in physics and mathematics. He was not able to fully explain his theories to himself but they seemed to fit together like pieces of a jigsaw, fitting together like a master-piece.  

Einstein had one great flaw, he was often"
" Furthermore, it is very common to see newly-built housing blocks on the horizon and it is hard to imagine the sky being visible to everyone in a traditional observatory for the past few hours. On top of this the social situation has changed. There is an increasing number of people of younger ages who grew up with computers. Children of school age are becoming amateur astronomers. Some of these kids will follow their dreams to become professional astronomers. It is not hard to see how this may lead to a decline in the numbers of professional astronomers and a decline in the number of public and school-based outreach activities. All this makes one thing clear: Amateur astronomy has never been better. It has even been better than the golden age of professional astronomy. Indeed, the golden age of amateur astronomy is but a faint memory. In the last ten to twenty years the number of observers has increased to the extent that even professional observers feel the need to keep up with what amateur astronomers are doing. Amateurs have caught up. That is not a good thing. I suspect that we will look back on the golden age of amateur astronomy as a golden age of mediocrity, rather than of excellence.

The case for professional astronomy being bad for amateur astronomy can be made in two ways. On the positive side, there is a natural progression to professionalism. It is certainly true that with the increase in availability and affordability of electronic equipment and calculators, the amateur has become a professional"," Most of the desert sky has now been viewed. One must now view the heavens in the near-infrared in preference to the visual region where most amateur telescopes are now optimized. The quality of CCD cameras has improved such that the sharpness and dynamic range of the images has now reached the equivalent of an 8 inch film or 35mm SLR camera. There are still challenges though. In many parts of the world the cold winter nights and scorching summer days make observing conditions unfavourable. Weather can also slow progress. One must be prepared to wait several days or even a week for clear, dark skies. A final challenge perhaps, is that many amateurs have chosen to locate their telescopes in locations that are not ideal, such as public squares, parks and even on the roofs of buildings. The telescopes are then pointed at the sky and not the ground at which they are mounted. While this may be fine for professional astronomers working from a fixed observatory, it is inconvenient for the amateurs whose telescopes are pointed at the ground. There is nevertheless much to see in astronomy. There is much to learn and much to be said. The rewards are great.


The sky is alive with the beauty of the universe and the wonders of our own world. Amateur astronomy has now expanded to almost every area of science. From planet formation to nuclear fusion to the origins of life, astronomy today reaches across the universe and into every area of research. Amateur astronomy has been embraced by a global"," This is reflected in the numbers of amateur astronomers who operate in the field today. About two decades ago there were about 10,000 active observers working within the UK and Ireland. Today there are around 18,000. This has important implications for astronomy as well as the quality of observation. As astronomy became more accessible to the average person, the importance of smaller amateur telescopes has increased. These are capable of performing more detailed observations. This has led to the production of a new genre of small astronomical books for amateurs. The old hardback books are now mostly gone and replaced by electronic devices that include interactive charts and that can be viewed on a handheld screen. It has been claimed that many thousands of new amateurs have joined the community since the early 2000's. All these developments have led to major advancements in astronomy. For example digital imagery coupled with the latest techniques for measuring the ""transparency"" of the atmosphere (aka seeing) have led to the observation of numerous dimmer companions to the more common more visible planets and solar systems. There is no greater thrill for a modern astronomer than being able to look up at the night sky and see something new. There is an ever increasing repertoire of discoveries to be made. A2. Well now we have better telescopes, electronic almanacs and catalogues, more amateurs taking up astronomy and better observing techniques all leading to more discoveries. In 2023, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Dr Richard S. Fisher and"," And the quality of optical astronomy has declined considerably. One can't blame astronomy if people are less interested in it - but the reverse is the case. People are more interested in astronomy than ever before but the quality of results is likely to suffer as the quality of observational equipment declines and computational power increases.

Famous astronomers of past centuries include Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Tycho Brahe and Christiaan Huygens. Famous astronomical observations include the first detection of radio waves, observation of Sirius (the Dog Star) and of Cepheid variable stars.

  * Amateur astronomy has flourished in the past but has lost much of its lustre with the advent of better technology and the internet. 
  * The quality of observational equipment has improved greatly in the past century but has failed to keep pace with computational power. As more data is gathered and analysed the results are likely to suffer.

  * The golden age of amateur astronomy cannot be denied but is bound to suffer due to the above-mentioned factors. It is sad but we must accept that there has been a decline in the quality of observational astronomy

  * In summary, I feel that whilst astronomy has had a golden age in the past, this cannot be denied to be a golden age of amateur astronomy. It remains to be seen how long this golden age will last

  * Of course, astronomy remains an amazing science and the study of celestial objects remains a fascinating exercise."," The range of interesting objects to watch has expanded greatly. There are millions of asteroids and comets to observe but also some thousands of individual planets, binary and multiple star systems. Close encounters with these objects are possible in the course of a lifetime. Weather permitting, outdoor observing conditions can be good but challenging. On the other hand, with the wealth of data now available, many new types of systems are now being discovered and this has resulted in refinements to our understanding of the processes and objects of the sky. There is much excitement in both the amateur and professional astronomical worlds. Observatories in the world's major cities contain world-class telescopes dedicated to observing particular regions of the sky, allowing a high rate of discovery and a high number of unique observations. The quality of education has increased substantially and some of the best in the field are working in the UK. The number of observatories devoted to child care has also grown. Many thousands of school children participate in local and regional astronomy clubs. There is even now a small but expanding community of professional astronomers who continue to contribute to our understanding of the universe. For all the progress that has been made, the future does not look rosy. The resources devoted to observing the sky are dwindling, with many countries facing budgetary shortages. Furthermore, while the internet is still new, one of the greatest sources of educational material is being lost as the educational content is transferred to the web. The cost of equipment and associated maintenance and up"," One consequence is that children nowadays may witness many fewer spectacular celestial events, be able to name fewer famous stars, and are far less likely to know what a comet is.  

Amateur Astronomy is read far more often than Amateur Astronomy.

Amateur Astronomy in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale 

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is based on word, sentence and syllable counts in a text. Words, sentences and syllables appear in the scale in an inverse order (e.g. 3.4 is ranked higher than 4.4). The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is most appropriate for texts in English.

Word counts are less important than they used to be since computing speeds have improved.

The Flesch reading score can be calculated as a ratio of words to sentences: 
Flesch Reading Scores: 0.6 - 3.8 =  Grade 7
Flesch Reading Scores: 3.9 - 7.0 = Grade 8
Flesch Reading Scores: 7.1 - 12.0 = Grade 9

However, words, sentences and syllables in Amateur Astronomy all have a relatively low Flesch reading score.

Amateur Astronomy has the following Flesch-Kincaid Grade count: 
0.6 words per sentence;
1.2 words per sentence;
2.0 words"," The range of objects visible to the unaided eye has diminished. One must now be able to see the Southern Cross and not the brightest star in the southern constellation Andromeda. Astronomy has also moved beyond the use of charts and catalogues. Now one may undertake scientific research without a detailed understanding of how one actually mounts and observes a telescope and makes observations. Although we might still say that astronomy has ""evolved"" into a more analytical and mathematical discipline it certainly has not left its infancy, it has merely entered a different room. It has not advanced to the level of A1 or A2.

" And the media are a tricky lot. They are never wrong. As soon as they say ""art"" they transform it into some kind of trendy new thing that all the cool people are doing. And so we are left with the uncomfortable fact that whatever you and I agree art is, we are now each part of the only few left who still call their work art.

Which brings me to my point. I am proud of the work I do. It's the best I can do in the given circumstances. And if it is good it will be praised and if it is bad it will be criticised. I don't give a damn what other people think. I don't know whether my work is revolutionary. All I know is that I feel great doing it. And I don't give a damn what you think or feel. Do you feel different? Do you love what I do? Then you should do it.

I don't believe that art has to be political or edgy or outrageous to be considered art. So long as it is done well. And that's what I do.

What do you think?

Art In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago"," 
We are encouraged to admire unique or revolutionary and to disapprove of what we see as not ""art"". However, if a particular artist is indeed not ""art"" then the opposite must surely be true and that is that his contemporaries were perfectly content to simply call what they were doing ""art"". There must have been a time when all artists were ""in revolt"" against the art of their day. But I cannot see that we are in that situation anymore. Now we all simply do ""art"" and each of us is happy to do so.

Art In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocked even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. But when we get to the art of our own day we get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far that what he does can no longer be called art. Or rather the media say it for us. We are encouraged to admire unique or revolutionary and to disapprove of what we see as not ""art"". However, if a particular artist is indeed not ""art"" then the opposite must surely be true and that is that his contemporaries were perfectly content to simply call what they were doing ""art"". There must have been a time when all artists were ""in revolt","

Let us start by establishing the meaning of the word “art”.  It means “the handiwork of the artist”. Art has no other function than to delight the eye and the ear.  An image of a landscape by a Dutch master will always be of greater art than an image of the same landscape created by an Indian photographer.  A photograph of a landscape may be technically better executed but if it does not tell a story to an art-lover it is of less art than the work of a masterful artist.  It is this function that the word “art” has lost to its opposite, ""commerce”, “industry”, or “technology”.  And this is a loss.  We feel bad about it and that is why we talk of Art for Art’s sake.  It was once the case, though seldom so today.  We went too far.  That is why the art of our day is “art” for art’s sake.  It is not art by any means but it will do for now.  As for the “media say it for us” comment I must point out that we do not live in a vacuum.  Art has a history that is inseparable from society in which it arises and thrives.  Therefore Art is not just a “media invention”.  Nor is it simply a reflection of the values of a given epoch and place.  Art is art because it is a human creation in"," When Andy Warhol showed a movie star oral sex we were horrified. But now the reverse is true. We would never be caught dead oral sex. And the same can be said for many other artists whose work we admire. We take it for granted that art should be about beauty and truth. It would not be art if it did not challenge convention. It would not be art if it conformed to popular taste. But when we see the art of our own day and we say that this is not art we are not judging it for artistic value. We are judging it for what it is. Because we are living in the Information Age and we want art that is contemporary. But above all we are concerned with taste, which is the standard against which all else is measured. And we judge that the art of our own day conforms too much to taste. It is too conventional. We see this when we take the time to study what an artist has done before us. Andy Warhol often made movies. But he made them exactly as the movies of the time were made. The same can be said for much contemporary art. It is derivative of earlier artists and it borrows its motifs from other sources. And as for originality. Yes we all remember the thrill of rediscovery. An unknown artist comes up with a unique and exciting idea and everyone says how come you were the first to think of this. But there is more to originality than the discovery of an interesting"," The artist is outraged and wants to denounce the modern world and everything in it that he considers immoral or reactionary. In the end it is the modern world that is seen to be responsible for the artist’s behaviour by the public and the courts come to his rescue and award him damages. In fact it is only when we learn that the artist only wanted to be paid for his work that the courts agree that he was entitled to some compensation. 

Some of the artists of our own day are no doubt disappointed that their work has so little social value or seems even to go against the grain. But we should not let them down: they are the artists we have come to admire and who have freed our souls. 

And what of the modern world? We have all learned to admire the artists’ rebellion. We might not praise their art as enthusiastically as they do but at least we no longer feel ashamed of looking at it. The modern world has come to be seen as a revolutionary place where one can breathe new life into art. 

But let us not forget that the modern world also has its own dark side, as artists are always reminded. For the modern world is also full of cynicism, opportunism, and compromises. The artist has to do what the public and the courts want. The public, after all, is paying for your work and has an interest in seeing it celebrated and protected. And the courts, for their part, always seem"," And yet the media never say the artist went too far. It is not so easy to know exactly what it is we are criticizing here as we read a famous poem by Keats - or a famous painting of the period - and in our eyes are dissatisfied with the quality of the work. I suspect that this is because we are comparing ourselves with an earlier age and cannot bring ourselves to believe that the modern artist has the freedom to do what we would consider shocking or revolutionary. That is our excuse. In fact, I suspect Keats and the other modern artists we praise went too far or too quietly settled for what was considered an acceptable compromise between what was possible for their time. It is possible we are criticizing the art of our own day. In a word the art of our own day is bold and original. We may admire its boldness but we are uncomfortable with its originality. In order to give us a clearer image of what Keats may be criticizing here we might compare the bold modernist poem to an earlier time with a different art form. Some of the boldest and most original poetry written in past times has been by the Norse. It begins with the line: This is the slaying of Naglfar. The giant killed the ship. Nowadays ships have been equipped with automatic weapons and giant killing is not necessary so much as a heroic adventure story. There is no call for such an immense craft as Naglfar and a ship with a"," We say this art has been done before. Or that it is just clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever. We are all quite happy when a new piece of art is discussed. The critics say it’s new and different. It's shocking or innovative. The critics write it up and we quote it to each other and look at the faces of our friends and acquaintances to see who likes what. We enjoy judging art and don’t want to be taken unawares. But there’s a huge difference between being a critic of art and actually being an artist. Critics aren’t called into question, the works of the critic are praised and often imitated but the critic doesn’t get an opportunity to produce any art himself, or herself. 
  Art today is more and more a matter of personal expression in the broadest sense of the word: it is much easier to create what you want and to put it in a gallery and claim it to be art even if that person never painted a thing in his life. That kind of art doesn’t interest me at all, but I do enjoy the fact that now I can create such art myself. I can say that I’ve taken a certain genre of art and transposed it to an issue that's important to me personally. I have no desire to be called a rebellious artist but who among us hasn't felt the need to break"
" At the start of the twentieth century advances in manufacturing and transport, along with the increased availability of raw materials and design ideas from across the world resulted in a boom in popular and fashion. It was during this time that the store became established as an important component of the production of popular culture and identity and also where 'the look' was formalised into a distinctive clothing style for each identified subculture. By the mid to late twentieth century the availability of affordable manufactured clothing was also a significant factor. In many ways the development of fashion as an industry and its role in popular culture, art, and the work place can be seen as a reflection of the role of capitalism in society and the economy. In fashion the market played an important role from the beginning, driving the commercialisation of the design and manufacture of clothing to serve the needs of the market. Over time the industry has become increasingly capital intensive and the driving force of capitalism to maximise value has resulted in the emergence of a multitude of subcultures, identities and styles and continues to do so.


It is important to note that fashion does not have a 'natural' cycle or path. Rather it is the result of continuous and often contradictory societal, political and cultural developments. For example, the advent of mass production and transportation of manufactured clothing around the world played a large part in the explosion of fashion in the 20th century; however, advances in manufacturing have also made it easier to produce and mass produce clothing at an affordable price,"," In this way the history of fashion is in many ways an analogy for the history of other forms of adornment including jewellery and cosmetics.

Fashion first came to be written down during the 1520s in Europe in the form of a dictionary definition of the word fashion as ""manner of dressing or fashioning"". Fashion is seen in the dictionary definition of fashion as ""the act or habit of dressing"". The meaning of ""dress"" was therefore already evident in this form of the term as was the idea of clothing as adornment.

The meanings of the word fashion have expanded in the past 200 years with the development of marketing in the nineteenth century. Since then we have seen the development of:

- Fashion journalism which is the application of journalism to the field of fashion
- Feminism and the analysis of gender roles and the appearance of women in the fashion industry
- Anthropologie,  and the growth of shopping malls which allow customers to walk around and view fashion displays
- The democratization of fashion with the growth of the Internet and mass production of celebrity fashion
- The growth of social media which brings social relevance to fashion
- The rise of the fashion industry to a multi billion dollar global industry.

Many of these are still occurring today in the form of feminism, marketing, celebrity culture and the democratization of fashion. 

Fashion has also influenced many other areas of modern society. For example one of"," As fashion’s complexity and significance increase so do those individuals and firms that work in the fashion industry and, indeed, the very concept of fashion becomes more of a business and industry than a purely aesthetic expression. At the end of the 18th century women in Britain started wearing corsets to tighten their waists and thus achieve a more “fashionable” shape. This was not for aesthetic reasons but because corsets helped women to manage the increasing muscularity, strength and sexual availability of the male body. By the turn of the century, women around the world had begun to emulate the increasingly tight and restrictive silhouette that the corset helped to create thanks to the invention of the steel frame that connected the panels of cloth around the body. As the 20th century progressed other technological innovations, for example the need to create air in pneumatic tires to enable cars to be driven on the road led to the development of a new type of footware – the rubber soled shoe. New technologies that had only just started to become available to people such as the electric radio led to the development of even newer technologies like electric shoes which had soles made of rubberized fabric. It was the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the birth of the international fashion industry, the ability to easily and cheaply distribute clothing throughout nations led to a need for the business of fashion.  

Fashion was not always seen"," The rise of steam power and transport has seen the invention of synthetic fabrics to replace the textiles made from animal skins.  It wasn’t long before the demand for fresh and new styles led to the advent of the travelling circus and finally the mass market of the nineteenth century. In this context the work of Karl Marx, who wrote ""Capital: A Critique of Political Economy"" in 1864, has become important. He was influenced by the Scottish economist Adam Smith’s work but instead of viewing fashion as arising from consumer demand for a specific product he argues that fashion itself is an agent for changing the social structure of classes and ruling classes from the top down. Fashion, he argues, is neither arbitrary nor accidental, but rather is a deliberate form of social organisation for regulating modes of production and for expressing economic and social power. The ability of firms to command vast capital resources and the resulting power they represent has led them to exert a particularly strong influence on fashion. These firms, called fashion trusts, set the standards that consumers follow so that all producers must meet the specifications of the market. As Marx argues, because of their power from having larger resources they set the standard which all other producers must meet, this results in a “uniform, uniformitarian, mechanical and rational fashion” which leads to the increasing uniformity of capitalist society, that is to say class division. For Marx the emergence of a fashion trust was a forerunner of the centralisation of capital. He argues that this led to the"," 

At first the marketisation of fashion was one response to the need to find an efficient method of organising and transporting textiles, especially in the expanding cities of Europe in the late Renaissance and early modern period. As demand for the supply of textiles outstripped supply the search for new methods of production began. In the early modern period this led to the development of machinery to cut and weave cloth and the invention of the factory system to mass-produce cloth. 

Even beyond the requirements of the market economy, however, fashion would appear to have been in the long term driven by the need to express individuality and to stand out from other individuals and groups. From the early modern period on individual styles of dress would become associated with particular social classes, regions, genders and religions and even as late as the modern period the clothes of one group might be rejected by another. 

The marketisation of fashion would appear to have resulted from its need to express individuality and to stand out from other individuals and groups. 

Fashion in the modern sense became a commercial venture driven primarily by economic necessity, in the form of the market, and its rise to prominence was facilitated by the development of the factory system and the rise of capitalism in general in the late modern period. There is however a long history to fashion and it goes back to the origins of civilisation itself. There is not one 'true' history of fashion because fashion, as style and design and","

From its origins in the late 17th century onwards the fashion industry has been closely intertwined with capitalism, the development of transportation methods and the expansion of markets.[31] Clothing became an integral aspect of the modern urban lifestyle, which meant that more people, especially in more affluent regions, started to purchase fashion items. As a consequence, designers were able to increase their income via selling their products to a larger market. As technology became more advanced, the time that it took to produce clothing decreased, which meant that new trends and styles became more visible to consumers.

By the late 18th and 19th centuries, fashion had become a significant source of pride for many social groups. While some were concerned with what others thought of their appearance, it was more a matter of self esteem for many others. In the early 19th century the first ""mills of clothing"" or factories in America began to appear, which were much more efficient than the small cottage industry of fashion in the past. This led to a larger production of clothing and a corresponding decrease in the variety of styles available. With cheaper transportation and better technology it was also much easier for people to move around and find new fashions, which encouraged greater consumer choice.[31] It took much longer for clothing to be physically altered, changed or customized to an individual's needs before the 19th century than it does today so that means that consumers were more loyal to their specific fashion choices.

As more"," The market and mercantile trade developed slowly until the late 16th century but when it did so rapidly. The rapid growth of the market and mercantile trade in the late 16th and early 17th century meant a change in the way that people lived and the development of complex social practices and institutions in areas such as banking, insurance, transport and public health which all had a direct impact upon the production and consumption of clothing. The rapid growth of these new social institutions and their consumption meant that people in Europe began to move away from the wearing of clothes purely for physical comfort. However the shift away from physical comfort was not immediate and whilst people may have preferred to wear less fashionable yet more warm clothing, they still continued to wear appropriate clothing according to the season, weather, the activity they were engaging in and other factors such as the social standing of the wearer.


The narrative below assesses the fashion as an A2 subject using basic sentence patterns with memorised phrases, uses explicit information and limited number of information points:  

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point. As societies have developed in complexity populations have expanded and multiple technologies for"
" As people became more settled they began to carve more utilitarian tools. When people began carving flints they also began to etch designs into the flint which revealed information about the tool maker. The earliest known symbols were abstract circles with a dot in the middle. Gradually these symbols began to represent objects like animals, human heads, snakes and eventually specific individuals. 

As the knowledge of metals was disseminated through the use of symbols some symbol makers began to use more abstract symbols which incorporated lines and curves and soon these began to emerge more overtly as linear symbols. Some of these include the earliest known alphabet. These symbols were likely used for a variety of purposes. In addition to being carvers of flint tools they could also be used as memory aids, a way to communicate ideas verbally and, in the case of abstract symbols, to help memory. 

A critical element of any language is the ability to communicate ideas. This is typically done by putting ideas into sentences which are grammatical, which are easy to remember and which can be translated into concepts understandable by other individuals who do not speak the language in which the idea was communicated. One cannot communicate with someone who speaks a different language if they do not have the ability to interpret the symbols used to communicate ideas. In order to communicate ideas in any language there must be an ability to put ideas into sentences and there must be the ability to remember those ideas and the ability to translate those ideas into concepts understandable by another individual who"," The earliest evidence of gold being used as a commodity comes from the Upper Palaeolithic around 30,000 years BC. The Neanderthal man left 400,000 fossils in one cave alone. It was the great Mesopotamia Civilisation that brought the practice of mining to its zenith. Copper, lead, silver and zinc were extracted from the soil and used as money, trade goods and prestige items. They were of great importance in many areas of the society such as weapons, tools, religious ritual, architecture and even in cosmetics for women. In the year 100 BC, the Roman Emperors issued the Edict of Constantine which legalised Christianity and made the practice of Roman Gold-coinage compulsory for the entire Roman Empire. 

One hundred and thirty five years after the first discovery of gold in California (April 1848), the California Gold Rush brought thousands of people to the new state. The discovery of gold in California was a boon for people who were seeking economic opportunity. The money made from the extraction of gold helped people purchase food and supplies and provided money to the government to fund public works. However, the gold rush also resulted in over-exploitation and environmental destruction. Millions of acres of land was taken up for mining operations which severely impacted the environment and the local population. There were numerous reports of mercury poisoning, arsenic contamination, poor working conditions and diseases amongst the miners. 

This narrative was developed with the support of the", The first uses of gold may have been as ornaments or perhaps as storage devices.  Ancient art seems to have been adorned with gold leaf and the Egyptians must have been particularly adept at engraving and painting upon metal plates.  From these early humble beginnings gold soon became a valued asset in trade and soon a central part of civilization.  One can argue that it was the Phoenicians who first used gold in their ancient commerce.  In time Rome arose and with it its emperors who not only adorned themselves but also emulated the past by using gold jewellery and heavy gold objects such as the large gold urn used to hold cremated ashes of dead emperors.  During the Renaissance gold once again arose in fashion and even became associated with the nobility.  Gold continued to rise in value with the industrial revolution and a burgeoning middle class with disposable income.  As a result of the increased demand for gold and a weakening of the gold standard the price of gold increased dramatically.  The 1970’s oil crisis seemed to be the death knell for gold.  However a new bull market emerged in the 1990's driven in part by the rise of the internet and the growth of the gold-mining sector.  In the new millennium it was discovered that gold had formed a sinter (solid solution of oxides) with itself.  At first this may have been viewed by many as a further sign of the impending death knell," The first use of gold for any purpose would have been for ornaments to be worn on the person. In time gold became the focus of a commercial enterprise that produced objects of utility. It was to the ancient Egyptians that we owe the first use of gold in the form of currency. The ancient Romans adopted the practice and continued to do so even into the modern day. Throughout the centuries gold found favor amongst royalty, the power structure of society and also amongst others. In our time there is gold mining in Brazil, gold-plating in the United States, and gold selling in India.

Egyptologists believe it led to the golden age in history when Ancient Egypt is known for its beautiful statues, tombs and artifacts. From Egypt gold flowed to the Mediterranean. It travelled to Europe through the Byzantine trade and made it's way to Asia and then India through the Arabic merchants. In India it found it's way to the Far East via sea-travel. There are a number of cultures that claim to be the earliest users of gold, including but not limited to Ancient Egypt, early Sumer, Mesopotamia, Persia and Greece. The introduction of gold to Europe led to a cultural renaissance. It became used to make crowns, cups, dishes, swords and even paint. The use of gold in Europe led to the rebirth of Gothic, Romanesque, Baroque and Rococo architecture, all of which became more lavish and ornate. The use of gold in Europe reached a zenith in the late 15th century with the Renaissance and the Italian renaissance. In the 18th and early 19th century it fell out of favour with the rise of Romanticism. Since then it's use has declined as it was considered to be old fashioned and less desirable than other metals such as silver and copper. In the 20th century it fell out of favour once again and has been used only sporadically"," There is no evidence in the form of artefacts of what type of animal killed the fish but the people were starving so maybe it did not matter. What does not seem to have occurred to our ancestors is that when they tried to make a metal it created more of the raw material than it did the finished metal. This was a costly error that would prove highly hazardous. In time they would learn.

One of the greatest civilizations on this planet has been the Indus valley civilization. It flourished about a thousand years before the start of the Common Era (roughly 11,600–9,000 BC). They were a gatherer- hunter-fishermen who were among the first to domesticate animals. The city of Harappa is their best-preserved site. It lies about 50 kilometres (31 mi) southwest of the city of Mohenjo Daro in the Sindh Province of Pakistan. Another famous city, Harappa was built on the bank of the Yamuna River in the modern Indian state of Punjab. The city is roughly between the rivers Ganges and Yamuna, approximately 100 km (65 mi) northwest of Delhi.

The Harappa culture continued into the early centuries of the Common Era. The people of Harappa were sophisticated metalworkers and masons, and the Harappa site was one of the earliest known places where metalwork was carried out. It is believed that they produced coins and used metals for ornaments, weapons, tools and architectural purposes. They also used precious metal alloys in trade. In the late Harappa period (first century CE), their knowledge of metals is seen in the fact that they were melting down copper ingots to produce an ingot of pure copper and ingots of silver.

Their metalworking know-how was based on extraction of metallic ore, smelting, forging,"
" One moment everything can be still and all is silent. The next a human scream is torn from a throat. A child falls. A building collapses. The picture reveals a moment that was perhaps unique but is also mundane. I had my moments with photographs. They were a gift and like any gift you have to treat it with care lest it slip away. I had no idea that this moment I was witnessing would become the defining moment in my life. 

Vienna, like so many cities has old and new. The old part the center part with streets that have stood through several generations. New Vienna is being constructed across the lake. New streets. New buildings. This was a city trying to find its place in the modern world. In the old world old laws and traditions still had power. For centuries Jews had to look elsewhere for work or risk exile. In the new world they could become doctors, professors, architects, authors or athletes. This change brought a new energy to the city. It was never more evident than at the time of the Jewish revolt of 1848-1849. This was not a revolt of the poor but the very rich, the aristocracy. They threw off the yoke of the Habsburgs and now wanted their own Vienna. They were prepared to fight and die for the opportunity Vienna gave them to express their will. 

I was in Vienna in 1849 and this is what I saw. I saw old streets and buildings being torn down to"," 

The assignment that year was to photograph the famous Wiener Strasse. That would be a tough one. It was the famous Wiener Strasse. There were many blocks of flats. And so many crowds of people going about their business. 

But I was determined. I had arrived late on the first day. The streets had been full of people all day and I had been among them. But I would succeed in taking a picture of the Wiener Strasse. I had come up with a plan to rove the streets in a circular route. When I arrived at the spot where the street would intersect with another street I would set up my tripod and take a photograph of the intersecting streets. Then after a few hours had passed I would move on to the next intersection. The plan was working. I had taken pictures of all the streets that intersected. It would not be long before I got to the Wiener Strasse itself. 

Just then I saw someone coming my way. It was a boy about ten years old. He looked at me and I at him. Then he pointed down the street. He said something to his friend. The friend replied and they both took off running. It was then I realized I had been duped. They were just two more children playing hooky from school. I had been so focused on my plan to take photos of the Wiener Strasse that I had not heard the sound"," That was my philosophy.

I arrived at the Hotel Europa and went to the desk to request a room for one night. The desk clerk consulted the information card in front of him and glanced up. He seemed to be reading something. I was about to say something to him when he suddenly seemed to snap awake. He looked at me and said, ""Mr. John Soltan?"" ""Yes."" ""May I help you?"" ""I have a reservation"" ""Your name, please?"" ""My name is Soltan. Soltan John"" ""Mr. John Soltan?"" I was speechless. I had not known of his existence. ""Yes,"" I stuttered, ""yes, yes, that is correct."" ""When did you arrive in Vienna?"" ""Yesterday afternoon"" ""Oh, I see"" ""May I check you in, sir?"" ""Oh, yes, of course.""

Two hours later I returned from a dark alley to the Hotel Europa. A man stood in the hallway. The man was large. He wore a long overcoat and a hat pulled low over his eyes. A gun was seen in his hand. He shouted, ""This is a hold up! Grab the cash!"" I dropped to the floor. A shot was heard. I saw blood. I was certain my foot was shot off. I could hear the sound of crashing and smashing. My world faded.

The next thing I remember, I was in"," Then a miracle happened. Film ran out.

That day and for many similar days had I left the suitcase unattended. In that suitcase I carried all the equipment I needed to create a photograph. In the suitcase I kept a spare roll of film, a couple of boxes of extra filters, a polarising filter and a few other odds and ends that helped to make the picture. Then suddenly the suitcase was gone and in its place lay a small pile of photographs of Vienna. It wasn’t a match cut for the other ones. There was no way to explain that to the proprietor of the suitcase. The proprietor turned out to be the hotel porter and he was unhappy.

A few days later the suitcase disappeared again. This time it was an entire trunk of photographic equipment in it. The proprietor of the suitcase had been hired to deliver it to a client of his. He dropped it off on the sidewalk near the hotel. He was hoping to pick up the suitcase later but it didn’t show up.

The second time the suitcase disappeared the proprietor knew something was wrong. There was a problem with the suitcase and it wasn’t going to make it back to the suitcase owner. He realised that if he wanted to continue delivering photos to his client then he would have to do it himself.

I was born in 1960. I was 5 years old at the time. My father owned a small printing business and he sometimes would bring customers"," I did not know then that I would spend years chasing images only to have them slip away before my eyes.


I woke in a strange city. Visions of old friends and experiences from my undergraduate years filled my head. I sat up and my heart nearly stopped. It was like waking from a great dream only to realize it never happened. I had travelled back in time only to realize I was no longer in my previous reality. I had aged. My mind felt foggy. My heart was no longer in my chest. I was confused. I had never felt such a sharp decline in mental acuity. I looked to my left to my right. I saw myself but I could not believe I was seeing myself. I tried to say I was in Vienna but could not form the words. I knew it was still morning but it felt like the middle of the night.


I could make out the outlines of tables and chairs but it was difficult to see. I was in a strange city. A city I did not recognize. I felt for my camera and then realized I no longer had a camera with me. I had packed my camera bag in my hotel room only an hour prior. This was my first hint something was very wrong. I heard voices but I could not make out what they were saying. The fog in my head lifted but I felt disoriented. I got up from the table and looked out the window. The view from outside my hotel room was foreign and yet"," The streets were filled with activity as we arrived in Vienna, it was as if the city had emptied out. Everyone I spoke to seemed very tired. The sounds of traffic, the rumble of an electric tram and the rumble of car engines blended into a constant background soundscape. It was almost eerie. The city was silent. No sirens or horns, not a single vehicle moving on the streets. It was eerie. And I wondered why. Perhaps they all had important assignments to carry out, work to complete. Somewhere in the city the peace was valued and they were honour bound to keep it for the sake of the mission at hand. A mission that might never end, a never ending battle. To ensure the survival of the human race. I was tired too. Slept most days and when I did awake the city was still, the trams ran on time, and the motorised traffic still clamoured along the streets. On occasion I would find a few abandoned souls here and there on the sidewalks looking listless and forlorn. One day the city will awake and it will be as if we had never known a time of silence, a time when no-one walked the streets or held a conversation. I had come to Vienna to capture the essence of the city. To have a snapshot that would live on in the memory banks of my imagination. I had not realised how deeply embedded in my subconscious I had become. And so it"," I had already discovered how fleeting life was; how a smile was just a moment. How the flash of a bright white limousine could only be seen for a few heartbeats before the darkness had swallowed it up. How I longed for my home in California. But then the next minute the same serene scene could be replaced by the gritty squalor of an East European city. The Viennese, I quickly discovered, were equally a mixed bag. I loved taking pictures. Vienna was a beautiful city. But so many conflicting elements, so many disparate personalities made for a difficult city to photograph. I could never capture the essence of a city in a photograph. But despite its many faults I felt at home in Vienna. And that in turn was a mixed bag. I loved the openness and freedom of California. There I was suffocated by clichés and insipid suburbia. I could not find the freedom here. And my heart was not in Europe. I knew I would miss California more than any city in Europe. But when I look back on my two months in Vienna, I am glad I had experienced it. The people were kind. The food was delicious. And I had made many friends. But more than anything, I learned I could be at home in any city in the world. I had found my niche. I had found my style. And I was happy.

" The average sleeper needs seven to eight hours but we all know people who get by on five or six hours’. The sleep researcher cited lists those that are able to doze past 9pm as the ones who are probably lying. ‘That's like winning the lottery’. ‘Well it is if you are an adult’. 

The current recommendation is to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep per night for maximum health and productivity. While we don't fully understand the exact biological benefits that are conferred by sufficient sleep we do know that it is an essential aspect of human health.


There is a large volume of evidence to show that insufficient sleep is very bad for you, both physically and mentally. Studies have shown a link between chronic insufficient sleep and cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, depression, and even Alzheimer’s and certain types of cancer.

There is also a strong correlation between sleep and productivity at work: when employees are able to get more than the standard 8 hours of sleep per night, their creativity, energy, and focus at work improve.


That being said, how much sleep should you be getting? There is no hard-and-fast rule; each person’s sleep needs vary. However, many studies have suggested that the ideal amount of sleep is 7 to 9 hours per night, although there is evidence to suggest that getting less than 7 hours of sleep a night can be harmful, while getting more than 9 hours per night is not beneficial. The"," And we need to understand why. It is not just because we are busy that we need to get more sleep – in fact quite the opposite. ‘Being busy actually prevents your body from getting adequate sleep, so we need to stop assuming that people are chronically sleepy because they are busy.’ So what exactly is enough sleep like? The National Health Service (NHS) offers: ‘In England, there are three main types of night’s sleep: shallow or poor quality, which is from 7-8 hours; deep sleep, which is between 7 and 9 hours; and recovery sleep, which is over 9 hours.‘The quality of the sleeps has little to do with a person's mental capabilities and far more with their physical health. In other words, your quality of sleep is largely determined by your physiology, rather than your mental state or the circumstances of your life. We will need more than just one night of sleep to really understand it. It may be helpful for you to know whether your friends and family are getting the right amount of sleep too. So, what is enough sleep like? ‘In the morning you look around your bedroom and you feel groggy and unrefreshed. You don't feel fully present or alert. However, most people feel a bit groggy for a couple of hours after waking up, especially if they didn't sleep very deeply. This isn't a tragedy. You will feel more energetic, and your mind will be more clear."," People are now sleeping on average five or even six hours less a night than 30 years ago. The idea of too little or ‘too much’ sleep has been part of human culture for decades; the problem with modern society is we are not getting enough. In the USA, the National Sleep Foundation suggest eight hours: in other countries this varies. The USA are among those experimenting with different timescales to try and optimise health and productivity while sleeping, and indeed with people’s circadian rhythm – their bodily clock – these may impact on our need for sleep. But sleep deprivation may also come from other factors. Alcohol, caffeine and nicotine can affect sleep, too. In general, it is a good idea to try and limit these but this is not always possible and for some, medication may be required to help you sleep.  

The concept of a ‘good night’s sleep’ or sufficient rest is controversial and part of what makes it so is our limited understanding of exactly what is needed or desired for our health. 

In the past, sleep patterns may have been different. In an era of ‘working all the time’ or ‘long hours’ we may now need or desire more sleep. But it is not an issue of simply getting more sleep or a lack of sleep being wrong. Rather it is an example of how our understanding of what a good night’s sleep should be has evolved.  

There has been a steady growth of academic and professional interest in"," It’s one of the biological needs to sleep.’ And so this curious obsession with sleep might be summarised in the following way. We need to sleep because…  ‘There is little evidence that the need to sleep has changed significantly throughout history.’

In other words there is a need for sleep because we are human and we have evolved to sleep. A small amount of sleep allows us to use the next day to recover and prepare for the challenges of the next day. There is evidence that the average adult needs 7 to 8 hours of sleep. A lot of people find this difficult to achieve. ‘There are many factors that can contribute to insufficient sleep including, stress, caffeine, alcohol and many medications.’ 

Although there is no evidence that the need for sleep has changed significantly throughout history, there has been a marked increase in technology and its use which can contribute to people needing less sleep. As one of the leading sleep researchers puts it ‘our hectic lives are taking a physical and mental toll on our bodies, and our brains’ need for sleep is therefore getting more important.’ 

In recent years there have been a number of well known studies on the benefits of good quality sleep and the impact that lack of sleep can have on our health and productivity in the workplace. The link between sleep deprivation and accidents is also well documented. So it is perhaps not too surprising that many organisations in the UK and USA have invested in sleep facilities at work and have made the policy of no late"," We need to recognise that the modern world requires less sleep than ever before.’ Sleep, he says, no longer comes naturally to us. We need to learn to fall asleep and stay asleep. Research shows that the best way to acquire the ability to sleep well is to engage in regular sleep. ‘Getting 7 or 8 hours a night is the new normal.’ Research also suggests that poor sleep has a biological component: we produce less melatonin as we get older and this is a ‘chemical clock’ which controls our sleep-wake cycles. We don't need to be asleep to benefit from better sleep; this research could have implications for health: people suffering from insomnia have a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease, and research has shown that having ‘bad dreams’ can increase our stress hormone levels. On the whole, ‘The more you get, the better you feel’. But with the busy lives of many, many of us, ‘It’s a little difficult to follow this philosophy’. One suggestion to help sleep deprived people is: turn off your phone an hour or two before bed time. Research suggests it can play a big part in improving sleep. In terms of education, the effects of sleep deprivation can be seen: studies have shown that people who get less than 6 hours sleep a night are generally more irritable, less creative and often make poorer decisions than those who get more than 6 hours. But research in this area is conflicting, sometimes suggesting that sleep deprivation does not lead to worse decisions"," And people don't sleep well when they're tired’ adds another. For the author of this short text, tiredness and insufficient sleep are central preoccupations. The text looks at these preoccupations in detail, addressing the effects of too little and too much sleep. It concludes by offering readers some suggestions for how best to get by when you are tired and for the avoidance of sleep deprivation in the modern world.


Here is a passage from the text that is scored on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale:

“Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition. As the richer busier countries have grown so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings. Part of this interest is in sleep in general: in its rhythms its uses and in problems with sleeping. But a central preoccupation remains. ‘People need more sleep’ says one leading sleep researcher. ‘People cut back on sleep when they're busy. And people don't sleep well when they're tired’ adds another. For the author of this short text, tiredness and insufficient sleep are central preoccupations. The text looks at these preoccupations in detail, addressing the effects of too little and too much sleep. It concludes by offering"," But if we don't get adequate sleep, our brains don't function as well, our mood suffers, and our performance declines. It impacts on everything from our mood to our memory, and even our capacity to empathise and make decisions.' 

One reason for sleep deprivation is that our time is divided between different activities. Our minds, bodies and the world are constantly demanding our attention, demanding we attend to their needs. We check emails at night. We answer social media. We check the weather, our feeds, our timelines. There is no way of knowing when another activity will take over our time and attention. Our phones are now essential to daily functioning. Some say it is the lack of sunlight and fresh air that have made many people in cities feel the need for more and more sleep. In an increasingly polluted world there is little fresh air and in places with more direct sunlight you get better at detecting pollution. Research suggests that the problem is particularly acute in the spring and summer, during winter there is enough sleep. 

There are other reasons for lack of sleep. Our homes are now full of technology and gadgets. There are always devices needing us attention. We use wearables to monitor our mental and physical fitness. We are surrounded by food: our workplaces are full of cafes, restaurants and grocery stores. We eat very little real food and rely on a range of processed foods and high-fat, high-sugar fast foods for much of our calories"
" For instance, they could simply let the air conditioners turn on at different times of the year. Or they could use the free energy they generate to power the air-conditioning. That is exactly what the owners of this building are trying to do. 

The owners are keen to generate more energy from their buildings by installing solar panels. Unfortunately the panels have been installed in such a way that they fail to function. Fortunately the City of London has a remarkable history of ignoring rules and regulations that inhibit innovation. So now the owners are waiting for the government to clear a legal obstacle before they can install the panels, and in the meantime they are cutting down their trees to provide more seating space for people to enjoy the a/c. But without the panels generating energy the a/c won’t work and the trees will die, the perfect metaphor for a modern world that fails to balance the natural and social worlds.

In the modern world air conditioning has become a potent symbol of our ability to control the climate or at least modify it. It has become a central feature of work and play a potent symbol of the ability of humanity to control the climate or at least modify it


Unfortunately in this"," Window washing The heatwave has had an unusual effect on window washing. On many buildings the windows have been washed by hand to avoid paying exorbitant amounts for air-conditioning. This practice however misses the point of air-conditioning and also harms the environment. Air-conditioning has been the preferred method of keeping buildings cool for decades. It is efficient, effective and doesn’t leave any evidence of its use. 

Air-conditioning could well become a key part of city living in the future. There are already examples of air-conditioned buses and trains but large cities are still reliant on older methods of managing heat.


Window washing by hand is a more natural way of keeping buildings cool. It prevents buildings from looking cold and instead fosters a sense of community and co-operation. Window washing might even help protect the environment. It saves water, energy and money. 

Even with a more natural approach to keeping buildings cool, air-conditioning will remain a useful tool.


Another useful method of keeping buildings cool would be to prevent heat escaping from them. Buildings naturally leak heat. Heat can be gained from external sources such as solar radiation and internal sources such as the machinery and electrical systems within the building.

An air- conditioning unit placed outside a building would make the most of the available solar radiation and channel it into the building via a process known as thermal mass. The unit could be placed at strategic points such as near windows to capture as much"," For example:

Buildings with tall walls may adopt innovative approaches to ventilate interior spaces, using the cool air in the upper stories to drive a fan down into the street or courtyard below

Open-plan, airy design allows natural ventilation – the breeze in summer, the sea in the winter.

A well-insulated building can use insulation to keep air cool

Natural ventilation can be augmented by strategically placed operable windows

If, at times of the year when the gym is at its quietest, the temperature is not brought down then it can be run manually – as many fitness centres do. It then becomes a place where people come to be still, to reflect and rejuvenate.

In summary there are many ways to control the climate which humans have devised over the course of history but air-conditioning has become a potent symbol of our ability to do so.

[2] “Excess air-conditioning: a silent killer?”, BBC, 15"," They could, for example, reduce or even eliminate the use of air conditioning, a sensible alternative that would be more energy efficient. In this day and age, when we know that the Earth’s resources are finite, we should be using them more intelligently. For example, the fitness centre could instead invest in renewable energy or install blinds or even some shade if the sun was shining. Or maybe just put on some decent running shoes and run outside? This alternative approach of reducing or avoiding air-conditioning would be a sensible use of resources today. But at least it would be more comfortable.

Photograph:"," For example, by spreading out cool objects in the building, using strategically placed fans or installing a water chill in the external environment rather than relying on air-conditioning. In doing so, they could make a stronger and more considered use of air-conditioning rather than just treating it as a necessary evil.

The CEFR scale consists of a scale of 0 to 6 for each sector of the economy, with 0 representing the lowest risk of occupational injury and 6 representing the highest. The CEFR scale is a consensus risk assessment scale that is widely accepted within the insurance industry and is frequently used in the decision-making process when considering whether to employ someone in an industry or workplace.

Here are the CEFR ratings for Air-conditioning:

  * CEFR Code: A2 - In some workplaces air-conditioning is vital to controlling workplace temperatures, but excessive use can cause illness.

  * Average Annual Noise Levels: 55 dB(A)

  * Risk Assessment: 1

  * Control: Providing fresh air or ensuring the building is well ventilated. Ensuring noise levels are not excessive.

  * Control Measures: Ensuring the building has air-conditioning with or without other means of cooling. Installing strategically placed fans. Using cooled objects to spread out heat, or installing a water chiller in the external environment.

  * Measures to Control Risk: Ensuring people are adequately trained in the use of air-conditioning and"," Fans are nice to have but not a substitute for the power of evaporation. There are ways of cooling a room by reducing the humidity. But perhaps even more important than reducing humidity is reducing the temperature. In the ancient world humans relied upon sweating to cool their bodies and there is evidence of this tradition still evident in traditional Mongolian and Tibetan clothes which rely upon evaporative cooling. So great was this tradition that it came to be regarded as a virtue in its own right. Sweating allowed one to be free of the need to consume enormous amounts of food and drink to maintain body temperature. By contrast those who could not sweat relied upon over-heating. So the ancient Chinese developed methods to cool the air. They did this by burying large numbers of dried leaves and other items to absorb the heat of the summer sun. This is a good example of how a simple solution can be found by simply paying attention to the environment around us. Air-conditioning is therefore an excellent example of over-use of a simple solution. It should be used only when absolutely necessary and only for the purpose for which it was invented. In other words, never for socialising or as a substitute for intelligent conversation. It is a potent symbol of our ability to control the climate but it has outlived its purpose and can be allowed to die.

"," For example, by closing the windows. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur and inventor behind SpaceX and Tesla Motors, said: “The solution isn’t to crank the AC all the way up. It’s to make the space ship smaller.” His point was that the problem with air-conditioning is that it makes people fat and sedentary. This is perhaps a more important point since the current pandemic has highlighted the dangers of our too-efficiently-managed society. The high temperatures in London today may be unfortunate but at least the cold weather will kill more people. Musk’s solution, by comparison, will make the space ship faster, cheaper, better and safer. The idea of using air-conditioning to help fight the coronavirus pandemic however, is being considered by governments around the world. There are of course obvious drawbacks to the use of air-conditioning, chief among them being the need to constantly monitor the devices and ensure they do not overload, melt or otherwise fail. But this is exactly what the world needs during a pandemic when it is so desperately trying to protect the most vulnerable. What do you think? Should air-conditioning be used to fight the coronavirus pandemic?

" You screamed. You are male. We both learnt a hard lesson that day. I climbed out, you clung on. I promised you a pig. You never complained again.

On this note then, let us celebrate Christmas. I am currently reading A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, which was published in 1843. It is a delightful book about a bitter and cynical Spirit of Christmas who lives with a Scrooge (a businessman) and who, every Yuletide season, convinces Scrooge to become kinder, and more generous, to those around him. The Spirit of Christmas encourages Scrooge to buy a few good things for himself and his family rather than focusing on what he believes is his obligation to help the poor and needy. Scrooge reluctantly gives into the Spirit of Christmas and over the course of the story grows to be a nicer person, ultimately changing his ways, and in the end becoming poorer for his trouble.

On the whole, I have enjoyed reading A Christmas Carol. I hope you do, too. However, Dickens is a bitter man, particularly regarding the then lack of charity and kindness in Victorian England. For example, he writes:

What is the foundation of the Christmas table?… The turkey, I admit. Not alone on this foundation, but firmly established, is roast beef, plum pudding and Christmas puddings. And these not alone… but many a good thick slice of cold boiled ham; and"," You nearly let go, but I reminded you that you hadn’t eaten all day and that this would be a good opportunity to gain the necessary strength. You held the bucket with both hands until you were sure the well was empty and then set it down with care on the grass below. I didn’t think it wise to attempt a return trip. There was nothing but darkness below and, on any second, that thing you call the moon might just decide to visit.

Thank you, Mr. Fox.

"," In the end you gave out and I was forced to free you by throwing you out. I had been frightened at first, but with your encouragement I climbed out of the well myself to your joy and to the evident relief of my wife. I have been thinking of ways we can repeat the experience. 

1. We need to get the well bucket to a sufficiently deep hole that we can stand on the well wall and see the stars. If the day is cloudy we can wait until it is light and go down the well ourselves, but if the weather is good we need to make sure the bucket does not tip over.

2. We need to take you with us. You are very strong and could help to raise the bucket if necessary.

3. We can give you a boost. We will hold the bucket steady while you push off from the well wall.

4. We can try throwing you out of the well. This seems most risky, but we will do our best to ensure that you hit the ground with sufficient force.


The following is a passage from George Orwell’s Animal Farm.  

Animal Farm is a book about an imaginary animal farm.  It was written in 1945 and is set in a world at war, in which animals control humans.  All humans are considered equal, but some humans are more equal than others.  Among the animals on the farm there are several clans.  The pigs, the"," I watched in amazement as the bucket reached what seemed to me to be an impossible height, then you cried “No, it can’t be”. As the bucket began its slow descent your voice is cracking I called down to you again. “It’s down, it’s done”.

You stare down into the well, your hand at the brim. You have said little since your eyes first opened when the sun was just above the tree line. The Well is cold and dark, a strange silence hovers over it, and you seem afraid to move lest you disturb the stillness. You are exhausted and you don’t understand why you are there. You reach down to touch the earth, you are not sure you want to know the answer. Your hand descends but the well quickly claims it. Your other hand is stretched out before you but the air is heavy and still and there is only silence and the sound of your ragged breath. Your body begins to shake and you feel a cold sweat prickling across your back. You look up and at last you see the stars. You watch them for a while but then you become aware of the earth beneath your back. You turn and look into the well but you cannot move, it is no longer a well it is a tomb.

Your friends and neighbours drop by to pay you a visit and they are not alone in noticing the changes that have come over you. “The Well” is no more;"," I could hear my own gasps for breath as the water hit with a splash. You clung to the handle as I stood up and felt around for the towel and soap and began to clean up. I told you it was for your own safety and that you should reconsider your choice to assist with my well-making. We had our second argument by the well. I asked you again to let me down and you told me that you would not do that until we were home safe inside the cottage. I told you that I was leaving you here until you agreed that I could return you to the cottage, but that I would not allow you to fall again into the well should you try to escape. You replied that you were going to get the bucket to the surface. I knew what that meant and I knew what you would do. You leaned out and held your arms outstretched and let go. You watched in horror as I was sucked into the well. You let go of the handle too and I fell. I tried to scream but no sound came out. I heard your screams of “I’ve lost my grip! I’ve lost my grip!” as you reached out again for me but the well was taking you too. I knew this was it; I knew I could no longer resist the pull of the well and was going to go down for what felt like an eternity but was in reality only a few seconds. I could see the stars above me as the well filled"," My head seemed to clear more quickly than my body so I must have passed out as I was falling but the bucket and the well bucket are different styles of tub like things one did not pass out from. When I opened my eyes in the bottom of the well I was in a cave. My hands were tied behind my back. I was wearing a pained expression. The cave smelled strongly of dirt, old sweat, and wet stone. I examined my hands but could not tell how much I had dirtied them. I was alone. You had not returned and I suspected that, as you are a person, you might have been worried, but then you’re a person, so I concluded you must have got into a scrape and been unable to contact me. So, I sat down and explored my new surroundings. I inspected my wrists which appeared to have at least two fingers broken. I could tell from the way the skin flexed. I decided to take my chances and I pried at the bonds. They were well tied but not too tight. I freed both my hands and made my way to the back of the cave. A large spider scuttled past my face, I caught it in my hand and returned to the front of the cave. On entering the cave’s opening I discovered another cave behind it. So, I made a plan to get out of both caves and back to the outside. I went to the front cave, got down on my hands and knees"," I clung on desperately as I plummeted downwards losing all sight of the stars. After some moments I pulled you down after me only to find we both had slipped into the well and were trapped. I was nearly out the other side when something strange started happening. I couldn’t see any stars, my view of the well had narrowed and the wall was moving up to close in on us. I began to panic and reached towards the rope that had fallen into the well. Your hand reached out and felt it and then a surge of joy that made my heart leap out of my chest as we began to climb out of the well. I could not believe the experience, the exhilaration, the miracle that had taken place. The stars were still there in their place, they were just hidden by the cloudy night sky. I have no idea what the stars have done to me I will always remember that night.


Text assessed as A2 level:

I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched eyes wide fist to mouth as I winched up the well bucket steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I had not thought to allow for the bucket’s much increased weight your lack of strength or inclination to just stand back and let what would happen happen. You held the handle taking"
" The sense of familiarity was therefore somewhat ambiguous. 

“Welcome home”, he said now to the empty flat, still feeling slightly disconcerted by this experience of having entered a space that was not his.


The flat was bare but for two pieces of furniture, one of which was clearly his wife's, an old oak coffee table which was in fact where he stored the bulk of his things, and the other a small dining table that looked as though it had always resided in the corner of the living room. To the left of the table there was a comfortable couch and to the right a small area where the television usually rested. Ralph went over to the coffee table and rummaged through the contents of the drawer that served as a pantry; these contained various food containers, glasses, and other items that he rarely used. He also took a bottle of Scotch which he had bought for his 70th birthday and placed it on the table, but not open. He was about to go back to the dining table when he felt a tap on the shoulder. He looked up and saw the figure of Lena standing in the doorway. She was dressed entirely in black, with a black vest and jacket and a long black skirt. She was also armed with a pair of black leather gloves.

“Hello Lena”, he said.

“Good evening, Ralph”, she said. “You seem to be alone.”

“I am, I’m"," The first time that he’d noticed this sensation was when the front door had flown open and he’d seen two men enter. He’d quickly realised they were the neighbours and their arrival a sign of the times. Now he felt the pull of history and, as though he was visiting an exhibit at a museum, examined the objects with which he was presented as though he was a curator or dealer in antiquities. 

“Hello, how are you?” The male neighbour offered this as he approached with a handshake which seemed to Ralph to be somewhat hesitant. He wondered what he should do or say. 

“I’m well, thank you.” Ralph responded, uncertain. 

“My wife and I were wondering if you had any pets, or, perhaps, we could use your landline or whatever?” 

Ralph nodded, not quite sure what was being asked but eager to find out more about the neighbours. 

“They must be lovely; they tend to animals, don’t they?” The man turned and gestured around the property as though he were a farmer describing a particularly fine herd of cows. 

“They have two cats which, I believe, used to belong to the building owner, but I don’t think they’re still with him.” 

“Ah, I see.”

Ralph noticed that his neighbour seemed to be looking about the property more and more intently and so he felt the","  Now as he groped his way along the hall, he heard a distinct scuttling sound.  ‘What the devil is this? Some sort of house rat?’  He switched on the hall light and saw a dark form scuttle into the living room.   ‘Rat…?’ The word escaped before he thought. ‘Some rat must have entered my house, through this very door. I’ll have it removed! It is a menace!’   He stomped his right foot. ‘Some rat, here? In my house?’  He then became aware of the sound of a heavy thud followed by the shuffling of paper, paper that ruffled with wind as if the person or persons involved had hurriedly put together a document. As the noise faded into silence, Ralph now realized the source of the noise: an abandoned paper clip. He picked it up and examined it closely.  ‘It’s very dirty and obviously the work of someone who has not been well maintained. Some rat…!’  His heart skipped a beat as he realized the noise had not been made by some rat but by his son, John, who was at that moment on his way up the staircase, and whose footsteps on the stairs had been loud and impatient, his head down, the noise echoing up the staircase and catching in his throat.  Ralph was overcome with emotion.  He felt tears well up in his eyes.  He was overcome with emotion at the"," This evening he was met by an expectant glance from the living room through the door, a look that said “Come in. It’s nearly ready.” When Ralph entered the room the light from the television set made a cone of the coffee table. He walked across the carpet towards it and paused for a moment, feeling the weight of his feet on the thick pile of the thick carpet. He thought for a moment of how old he felt, feeling ancient against the space of the room. He watched the old TV set with a sense of nostalgia for the hours of the evening when he used to sit on the couch and watch television with his father. His father had been a bigger man than him but had always been close to him, had held his hand when he was a child, had shared his snacks of chocolate and crisps, had taught him to drive when he was twelve. The room was now full of the clatter of games which his son had left scattered along the coffee table as though it had been abandoned there. He crossed the room and picked up the small video game system, feeling once again a sense of proprietorship. Then he realized that the old TV set was still on the coffee table. He turned to see what was wrong with it, and saw a man with a thin face and a shaven head that he presumed was the television repairman standing behind him. He looked up and saw that the man was looking at him. The man smiled, revealing sharp pointed"," Now all that was true but now the hall was silent and it felt as though something had died in the space. It was as though the spirit of his first home had died in its new home; something of the spaciousness of the old and the cozy comfort of the new had been transferred to the new place. Ralph didn’t know it but it was one of the most powerful experiences he’d had in his new home. In his old home the spirit had always been at work, animating the surroundings and bringing a glow to the home. His new home lacked this warmth. 
Ralph took a deep breath. He had forgotten to turn on the lights, but not before he had experienced all the nuances of the space: the silence and the emptiness seemed to echo his presence, and he could almost hear his heartbeat in the silence, which now seemed to his nervous ears louder than before. 

He glanced at his watch, it was already 2:55 pm. He took the stairs two at a time and called out “Cecilia?” The sound of his wife’s voice seemed a long time in coming, in the silence that followed he could distinctly hear the sound of his own footsteps on the stairs. “Cecilia?”, he called out again. Still no answer, he looked into the first bedroom he came to, it looked as if no one had been in it for some time; the empty space seemed to call to him in its empt"," On this evening, he was mildly surprised not to see so much as a rat or two to confirm his conviction that the place was uninhabited. It was as if the tenants who might reside here had already vacated. A chill swept over him and it occurred to him that it might be a good idea to turn the heating on, if only to reassure himself that it hadn’t frozen to death over the weekend. 
He was halfway along the landing when he noticed something on the floor. He bent down to pick it up but at that moment he realised his error. This was not an item of furniture, it was a small object shaped like a bowl and made of an odd material — a pale grey metal which looked as if it might burn if you picked it up too quickly. It looked as if it might be radioactive, he thought in sudden alarm and averted his eyes lest he look at it too intently. He couldn’t resist the temptation though. He picked it up and held it up to the light, peering at it curiously as if it might reveal its secret. He sniffed it tentatively and then shook his head. It did smell faintly of radiation but he couldn’t say whether this was a bad thing or a good one. He put the object down carefully. As he straightened up he saw that the object had a strange effect on the light. It looked as if it had a crack running along one side and a small figure"," The hall was sparsely furnished although the living room gave some promise of cosiness as the couch and chair faced each other over the large table in front of the big window that overlooked the back gardens and the open sky. As Ralph walked around the place he had found the place strangely quiet, the silence broken only by a faint, barely discernible whirring from somewhere deep in the building. He hadn’t wanted to start a fire in the place so he’d just turned on the lights which, after some awkwardness, set the place humming. As he sat down in the armchair he had found the seat suddenly hard. It took a few moments for his limbs to adjust before the pleasant sensation of being rocked by the familiar upholstery spread through his frame. His first move had been to make a cursory inspection of the place, his eyes probing the recesses of the space behind the thick curtain of the armchair. It was clear that the flat had not been used for a long time. He wondered if the owner had simply been too busy to clean the place up or if this was how the tenants felt and preferred to pretend the space didn’t exist. Some items of furniture were indeed rather battered, the sofa and the coffee table particularly so, their colouring faded or worn. He found the photographs of the family he remembered—the parents in the last years of their lives and the sister who had been so full of life when she’d visited him"
" There is a fundamental need to be able to look back and understand our past to plan for the future, and to be able to do this we need to be able to trust and accept that our past is not unique - and that we are not singular in our achievements but are part of a greater whole. There is no such thing as ""our"" heritage - everything we have built, learned from and passed on is a part of human heritage. Every living being is in possession of a legacy of previous living beings. This is a fundamental human right to carry with us on our evolutionary journey through time. The more we share this human heritage with each other the more we will be able to contribute to the advancement of humankind. And of course there is the matter of financial security, in this time of unprecedented change a connection to the past will allow us to plan for the future and allow us to focus on what we are doing here and now. To have something with which to invest, to know that we have control over the future. It is also important to note that heritage is not exclusive - it should never be used as a means of excluding, marginalizing or undermining other equally valuable contributions to human advancement. Rather, it should be used as an equalizer. To acknowledge the contributions of all those who have gone before us and give them their just due. In doing this we will have advanced as a species and advanced the cause of justice and equality. The power of heritage is found in the"," Thus there is also an ethical dimension to heritage - it helps us live in the present with sensitivity to the past and understanding for the future.


The importance of heritage  is that it is a foundational knowledge that must be inculcated in each and every one of us. It is a part of everyone's DNA so we should always be curious to understand it. People often talk about heritage but rarely do they put it in writing. It is not a text book knowledge - it is something that should be constantly nurtured and grown.

It is not just about knowing about the past but living with an understanding of the past that makes us a better human being. It should shape every aspect of our lives. Heritage is indeed a source of pride for people and communities - it is an essential component in achieving our collective goal of nation building - a healthy nation that is well connected to the past, present and future.


We often talk about heritage being a source of pride - what does it actually mean?


Heritage gives us a sense of belonging  to a community. It gives us a sense of common identity and a sense of shared purpose. We are inspired by the vision and ideals of our past and we look to the past for guidance in shaping the future. It helps us overcome hurdles  to create a strong foundation on which we can build our future. It is a source of pride and also a force that should be embraced instead of hiding away.

"," The importance of heritage is not just for what it symbolises but for the way it helps us to solve our most pressing problems today like migration, inequality, poverty and climate change. Heritage also plays a vital role in promoting the exchange of knowledge, experience and skills, it is a way of keeping our communities and countries fresh and vibrant and alive. Heritage is a powerful tool that can be used to build a better country and a better world. As George Osborne famously said when he was British Chancellor: ""You didn't build that"".  Heritage is a great power that can be used to build a better Britain for the future.  We cannot ignore our past as it is how we arrive at where we are today. As we look to the future we need to remember and make the most of our past.


And the answer, according to the OISB website is:


Heritage is about understanding the past, and building a better future for present and future generations.


So it is certainly not about keeping our countries and communities ""alive"". It is much more about us knowing about the past so we can help our communities and countries adapt to the future. It is about helping us understand and interpret our future so we can help create a better world for our present and future generations.


The OISB website then goes on to say:  

Heritage is a key tool for problem solving: migration, inequality, poverty and climate change. It","

We might have an individual heritage but if we lose our connection with the greater historical framework of which we are a part, then our individual identities will be lost. This is the importance of heritage. It has the power to give meaning to life.

Heritage is particularly important in our own communities. We often know very little about our own history and what has happened in our own locality. The history of our locality becomes the collective memory and history of the community. It is through understanding our collective heritage that we learn from our past and help protect and assure our future.

  * The idea of heritage can refer to any knowledge of the past that gives a person or group a sense of identity, continuity, or connection.

  * People might know their grandparents and know about their stories about how they lived, but unless they understand the broader historical context, their sense of individual and collective identity will be very shallow.

  *  Heritage is particularly important in communities because it provides a sense of continuity for individuals and a collective memory for the community as a whole.

  * Heritage represents a fundamental desire for continuity - assurance about the past goes a long way to assuring our future. It is through this continuity that we achieve our own place in history - our own immortality.

  * When we know little about our own history or the history of our locality, the history of the community becomes a source of knowledge and identity.

  * Heritage is particularly important"," The knowledge of the past is crucial in protecting us against the unknown. We cannot predict what the future may bring but through the accumulated knowledge of the past we can make informed judgements about the dangers facing our community and the changes that might be required to avoid their reoccurrence. Heritage is also a source of pride for our societies and a sense of shared achievement. It is a powerful tool which can be used to help us understand ourselves, each other and our place in the larger world. It contributes to an optimistic view of the future and thus fosters a more positive environment for the development and well-being of individuals, families and communities.

She was from a small village in the hinterlands of Britain. Her name was Margaret and her family name was Murphy. She was born in the year 1922 and she grew up in a world that was on the whole rather traditional in terms of values and thinking. Her family were not well off by contemporary standards, they made do through hard work and a sense of duty, and they regarded themselves as being part of the community in which they lived. And in this sense they were not that different from many others at that time. Margaret loved going to the village church on Sundays,","

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is used primarily for English texts. Grade 2 readers can also look at Grade 3 and Grade 4 materials if needed, but it is best to check the publisher's guidelines.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale consists of 12 levels, each representing a slight tweak to the original Flesch and Kincaid algorithm. Each algorithm is optimized for different criteria, and each value is slightly different. The goal is to make the text more readable.

The following is a scale from worst to best:

1 - This text is very easy to read, with no problems with any of the criteria
2 - This text is somewhat easy to read, with some of the criteria having problems.
3 - This text is somewhat hard to read, with most of the criteria having problems.
4 - This text is very hard to read, with most of the criteria having problems.

The scores on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale are not meant to represent a simple average, but a summary of the difficulty readers encounter when parsing text.

Heritage The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived. But beyond that there is a wider basic need to learn about our past in"," 

Heritage has a two main strands - the physical heritage (buildings, artefacts, parks etc.) and the intangible heritage (oral history, knowledge, skills, values etc.). These both should be passed on to the next generation in order to guarantee continuity and ensure that the past informs and shapes the future.

Heritage is also an extremely important element in the economic, social and cultural life of an area. As a general rule the economic benefits of preserving and managing heritage are very positive. Examples include the maintenance of a community's historical character, the preservation of a place's unique identity and the enhancement of property values.

Despite its economic value heritage is unfortunately often discarded or ignored by governments and policy-makers. Examples include policies that encourage the demolition of heritage buildings and the construction of new buildings or infrastructure. The irrational nature of this approach cannot continue. It cannot be about saving money or generating short-term economic benefits: it has to be based on long-term economic benefits that take into account both the construction market and the lifespan of buildings.

Heritage should be preserved and actively managed to ensure that it is maintained and enhances the quality of life of present and future generations. 

Although the above narrative is explicitly about heritage, it has a wider significance because it is an excellent example of how to teach about heritage using basic sentence patterns and a few informative sentences at each information point (similar to a textbook).

" At the end of the day Othello is the remarkable production of a classic by the brilliant Theatre Royal Stratford that brings Shakespeare’s work to life again in Stratford and makes me want to visit the city again. 
Othello is on at Stratford until 9 August 2020

Othello is the remarkable production of a classic by the brilliant Theatre Royal Stratford that brings Shakespeare’s work to life again in Stratford and makes me want to visit the city again. 

Stratfordians who have not seen this production (and why wouldn’t you want to?) may be disappointed to find out that the title role is played here by Ray Fearon, who is 33, rather than by an older 36-year-old such as Tim Pigott-Smith who plays Othello. That isn’t the only problem with the production: the story and the action are compressed into a single night, the pace is very brisk and some of the dancing is very jerky. And there are problems with the set design. 

The action takes place over a single night. 

Othello opened at the Theatre Royal Stratford in May 2019 and is directed by Stephen Daldry, whose previous Stratford credits include Love’s Labour’s Lost and King Lear. Othello is built around a single night in 1574, and takes its inspiration from an actual event, when the Ottoman admiral Barbarossa arrived in Liverpool."," The technical elements are impressive too. The use of bold, clear sound and lighting ensures that the action really takes place on the play space of the Royal Opera House. I am particularly struck by the technical prowess of lighting technician Matt Pritchard who must have spent many hours coordinating a complex set of spotlights. His technical wizardry adds a real depth of space to a pivotal scene. 

The technical elements are impressive too. The use of bold, clear sound and lighting ensures that the action really takes place on the play space of the Royal Opera House. Pritchard’s technical wizardry adds a real depth of space to a pivotal scene. 

Othello opens at Stratford-upon-Avon next month before transferring to London in June for a limited transfer run of three weeks. It will then return to Stratford for a further six months before a return visit to London in the summer of 2018. I expect to come back to Stratford again in 2020. As a resident of London and an ardent fan of Shakespeare, I have no doubt that this will be the definitive performance of one of the most famous Shakespeare plays.

Othello is a tragedy of two peoples that are caught up in a whirlwind of jealousy, passion and betrayal that sweeps over them like the tide.  

The plot could use a bit of tightening up and more emphasis on Othello’s ethical conundrum but otherwise its no bad Show and a thoroughly enjoyable hour and a quarter. Not cheap but well worth the entry price. For further details see:

Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare’s play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I still think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona but I eat my words about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. Indeed the whole cast is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio’s competitive games with the other young officers get dangerously out of hand and the moment when Iago begins to lose control and has to struggle to get a grip on himself. The production is"," The play moves back and forth between various locations including a prison, a Moorish tent, and the Othello mansion at the heart of the story. Iago's plotting, I think, is too pat and simplistic and the play is rich in symbolism and allusion that don’t have time to fully develop in a 90 minute version. I’m looking forward to hearing the 70 minute production that my friend and co-director Alex Reid has in development. I’d like to see if we can’t make a more satisfying production of Othello. Othello’s wife, Brabanzio’s daughter, the three runaway slaves, and the Moor’s daughter all come across as too passive and unemotional, with Brabanzio’s daughter especially being a problem, but I’ll grant that some of these characters aren’t given enough development or have limited lines. I also think that Othello’s jealous reaction to his wife’s friendship with Cassio is over-the-top but that could’ve been a major problem. Ultimately though Othello is a flawed but memorable play that deserves a better adaptation. I look forward to seeing it on the stage and applaud Mr Fearon for a fine performance. 

Some of the most common misconceptions about Flesch Kincaid stem from the word- difficulty, or word- frequency distributions.
These statistics were based on the American language, and","

We also have to give considerable credit to director David McVicar, who has created an ideal Shakespearean space for Stratford and who has helped to boost London's reputation as a centre for the performing arts. The Royal Shakespeare Company's Stratford East headquarters has never been tidier, nor do I doubt that Londoners will be lining up again for a ticket.

I have often thought that the Stratford Festival would do well to consider moving Othello into its main season, allowing it to exploit the best of what Shakespeare has given to the world. With the transfer of the play to London from Stratford completed, the rest is history. My vote for Best Production of a Play goes to London Stratford.

A2: Iago is jealous of Cassio’s good looks and athletic build; Iago, a jealous person, is angered by Cassio’s friendship with Othello; and Iago’s jealousy is one of the central motivations for Cassio’s later murder of Othello.

In Shakespeare’s Othello, Iago, a jealous person, is angered by Cassio’s friendship with Othello and kills Cassio for the latter’s good looks and athletic build. Iago is, therefore, one of the central motivations for Cassio’s later murder of Othello.

In Shakespeare’s Othello, Cassio is a good","

The transfer is an excellent production of a very good play, and with such a strong cast we can be reasonably sure that the quality will survive our time in Stratford.

" The hotel management had no idea of the provenance of the guests.

In the meantime the travel agent was busy sending another group to the Concordia. This time the agency chose a holiday in Spain. When the two travellers arrived at the Concordia they were directed to a building in the middle of the beautiful lake. The room was on the 6th floor, the view was of a huge city below and there were no other guests. There was one bed and a shower with a very loud showerhead that gave Keith a severe hernia. The other members of the group had a good time, all except one, for whom the hernia served only to reinforce his impression that he was in a prison camp. He would come to believe this when he saw that he could open and shut cupboards by touching the wall.

In the middle of the holiday Keith and Dawne decided that they should call the other members of their group to make sure that they were OK. Nobody was home. They waited an hour. Dawne and Keith began to look for food in the small kitchenette in the room but nobody was there. After a while Dawne realised that the other members of the group must have gone to the other hotels on the lake. She called one of the receptionists at the hotel and gave her their room number. She was put through to Room 212. The receptionist didn’t know of any guests in 212.

Dawne asked: “Are you sure"," And the story has a twist. The Swiss are kind and the hotel has a small pool. And at the pool edge there is a young girl called Paola and it’s Paola who teaches Keith how to swim. And although they are in the pool Keith keeps falling in and Paola says: “Uncle, you keep falling in, you will drown!”, he keeps trying because it feels so good. And Paola continues to say: “Uncle, you keep falling in, you will drown! But at least we will always be able to call ourselves Swimmers!”, Keith laughs because it’s true and he begins swimming with Paola swimming away from the side of the pool near the shallow end. Keith learns to swim and Paola also learns to swim and the two Swimmers swim for many, many years. And Keith learns a lot from Paola because Paola knows how to swim because Paola learned to swim from Paola! And after many, many years they both go to the same hotel, the Edelweiss, and Paola knocks on the door and tells Keith that he can come in. And Paola has brought a suitcase that he has forgotten and says: “Uncle, open your suitcase! There is something in there for you. It is your suitcase.” And when Keith unzips the suitcase he discovers a bunch of swimming trunks and some swimming goggles, but he can’t see any","  The first evening they were on their own to discover the local cuisine. They didn’t know where to start and the waiter was a little hostile.  Then the next morning while having a very late breakfast they noticed on the table a large box of chocolates which the hotel-keeper had provided. Dawne remembered the instructions that the package was for a family of four but they had travelled alone, Keith was feeling a little shy. The hotel-keeper took them to the reception area where, to their surprise, Dawne saw a big family from the south of England. In the end they learnt that the package should have been a family of six, but the six people were from a nearby town. At this point they began to suspect a little that something was not quite as it should have been and they asked the hotel-keeper for another copy of the documents so they could check that the information they had was correct. The hotel-keeper was not happy but they managed to get the original package which included the flight and the hotel.  When they went to the check-in desk there was still a question mark hanging over the package and they had to spend the rest of the holiday speaking a good deal of Italian to the family. As they say in Italian “Un po’ ci sbuffa ma sopra una bottiglia ce la fumo”.  Keith and Dawne were not entirely happy with the holiday and they did not appreciate the hostile breakfast, the late"," The hotel was a very charming establishment, but the hotel did not correspond to the description of the hotel on the website. On the website the hotel was called the Baur au Lac and it looked very convincing. But after all, if you are looking for a package holiday and are disappointed that you have ended up in a hotel in Room 212 of a different hotel than the one you had been promised, you would naturally be very disappointed indeed.

  * The incorrect description of the hotel - the incorrect name - made the package holiday look less attractive. 
  * This also happened with other packages the couple had been offered, but it seems that the travel agency was not very good at describing the details of their package. 
  * Despite what looks like a minor mismatch in the description of the hotel, this very minor mismatch actually creates a quite big mismatch in terms of expectations between the customer and the company. This mismatch creates frustration and dissatisfaction and can even lead to the customer quitting the company.

  * The clerk's and website's descriptions of the hotel were not similar enough - the hotel should have been called the Edelweiss rather than the Baur au Lac. 
  * In spite of the minor mismatch between the hotel description and the hotel itself, the customer's dissatisfaction would have been much greater had the two descriptions not been similar at all.

  * The calamity that fell in the middle of the planning became a calamity when it actually happened"," The Hotel is very nice, but the Swiss people are not particularly friendly to strangers. Keith and Dawne spent their first few days wandering around St. Moritz with no particular plan, just letting their feet take them where they wanted to go. The Swiss are particularly fond of foot massage so they went wandering around in the mountains, the valleys, the lakes, the mountains, everywhere but eventually back to St. Moritz. The weather was not pleasant, rainy most of the time but they found a nice Italian restaurant where they ate well and waited for the right day to travel to Venice by train.  The train journey was pleasant and when they got to Venice they went to the Pensione Concordia and reserved a room.  The room had a view of the canal and it was very comfortable. They walked around the Pensione but as the days got warmer they decided to return to the Hotel Edelweiss. This time they were received by the hotel staff with much greater cordiality.  The Hotel restaurant had the same view of the canal and they ate well and spent another pleasant night. Next morning they got up, had a coffee and breakfast and then went to the train station and bought a return ticket to Gatwick. 

On arrival in Gatwick they picked up their luggage and proceeded to the departures area where they queued up to check in for their return flight.  They had booked a flight in for the following day and after a pleasant night"," The Swiss were friendly but the hotel seemed a little on the small side for two people and their luggage. So they took a gondola ride in the rain through the square called Giudecca to reach the hotel. After a very disappointing meal in the hotel's restaurant they settled into their room which had a view across a canal of a very attractive canal barge called the Fusina.

" We were disappointed to learn that lions do not live as a cooperative unit. Lions fight and kill each other for sex, power and territory. Our research continues.


The story begins in 1978, when researchers at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in southern Kenya, came up with a new theory about the mysterious social patterns exhibited by the African lion. The idea was that lions were in fact a single, large and territorial clan of matrilineal maternal leopards, led by a matrilineal queen mother, with a complex social structure divided into two distinct levels of dominance. This unique social organization, in which all females are related to every other female, enabled the lions to cooperate effectively without the need for an intermediate level of social organization to manage conflict. As a result of this research, the Kenya lions were renamed ""kingdoms of Africa"" - a designation still used today. But despite this promising start, the project was abandoned after only three years due to funding and management issues.


Despite this early setback, research on this topic continued, but without the resources of a large conservation organization. The lion researchers split up, with some of them forming the basis for the ""African Lion Project"", an independent research foundation. Today, the foundation is responsible for over a dozen lion studies around the world, including Kenya, South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia. Among the researchers involved are: Michael Vlcek from the University of"," In our first publication we noted the existence of the ""core"" band, a group of about six lions whose roars dominated the other lions roars. We found that the core band was a stable structure that would be recruited whenever a lion felt there were enough members to generate a reliable roaring chorus. To get to the core the lions had to gain access to a group of lions whose roars were sufficiently loud to be heard over the core members roars. Lions would typically try to get to the core by attacking a lion from outside the group, a tactic which often backfired because the lion being targeted was often the strongest defending the group. A stronger member of the core band could therefore threaten the safety of the core and drive out members who didn't contribute enough to the core. Lions who were more likely to succeed at gaining access to the core band included those who were slightly larger, more aggressive or younger. It turned out that lions also competed to belong to the core band, to get closer to the leaders and to be able to defend the core from intruders. This led to a struggle for leadership among the lions and occasionally to the ejection of lions from the core band. The core band was an unstable structure, one which had to be continuously maintained through constant recruitment and expulsion. In the years to come new lions came to the group who didn't make sufficient contribution to the core band. As a result the core would become diluted and the lions who belonged to the core wouldn"," We were not disappointed. We found out that most lions do not hunt indiscriminately: there is a complex network of relationships that ensures prey safety and sustenance. What was initially an attempt to observe a band of wild cats in their natural habitat, turned into a surprise and unexpected discovery. We never would have predicted the subtle cooperation and social learning that underlies so much of the behavior. In fact, our findings were so interesting that we published them in the prestigious journal Science - something no other scientist had done before. The results were so unexpected that they triggered a major paradigm shift in our understanding of social learning and cooperation in animals.

Lions and their prey, wildebeest, take refuge at sunset under the watchful gaze of the Serengeti's pride of lions. The pack is not hunting indiscriminately. In fact, there is a sophisticated cooperation and social learning network that ensures prey safety and sustenance. 

A pride of lions in the Serengeti plains.

Certain characteristics of the environment, prey and even the predators themselves have evolved in such a way that they promote cooperation and social learning. The main advantage of such an arrangement seems to be that each member of the group receives a personal benefit in return for sharing information and acting in concert with others. The prey may be divided into two groups: the cows which are relatively docile, easy to hunt and easy to capture for later feeding, and the calves which are hard"," What we found instead was far less pretty. Lions evolved together for 20 million years. Since then they have developed a division of labour to suit the environment they live in. One lion will hunt alone or in pairs while another will stay at a distance and watch from a distance. The third will take the initiative and lead the group, usually when it is hunting where there are more meaty prizes such as animals, rather than large predators that rely on surprise attacks. Lions don't team up to hunt because they are like that, they team up to hunt because they have to, they have no choice. It is their environment that forces them together. The problem for lions is that the areas they live in are shrinking. And so they have to find other ways to survive. There is evidence of cannibalism, the lions that survive the change from once large enough to hunt easily to a smaller space and fewer prey will eat one another to survive. But cannibalism isn't what worries us. Cannibalism implies cooperation. When we observe real lions in the wild they don't hunt in teams. They don't team up to hunt because they are like that, they team up to hunt because they have to. It's simply the way it has to be. The story of the evolution of social behaviour in the animal kingdom could have been titled 'Why animals collaborate'. If one lion gets its lunch and eats it before the rest of the group can get its fill, there's no point in hunting"," We were amazed to discover that lions ate mice, gerbils and voles, which they caught themselves. This discovery led to a research career devoted to devising methods to help lion populations without poisoning them to extinction by supplying them with the nutrients they lacked through feeding on rodents. We are still working on this issue.


A2: Reconnaissance

Observing lions in the wild is an exciting experience. Here are a few ways to prepare:

1. Read up on the scientific work done on lions. The CEFR scale has been adopted by science as a framework to classify the nature of academic research done on lions. While the scale reflects the realism of the work done to this point, it would be useful to compare it to the reality you discover during your study of lions.

2. Read about lions and their social behaviour. Here are a couple of books which are recommended:
	- Lion behavior: an evolutionary analysis by Robin Dunbar and the Harvard lab of Elizabeth Vanderschwarm. It provides an evolutionary perspective on lions behaviour and social dynamics.
	- The predatory social behavior of lions and other cats by Frans de Waal. It provides a framework for studying lions social behaviour with an emphasis on intra-group dynamics.


3. Prepare to be surprised. Lion behaviour is not what we expected.


A3: Thesis

Lions in the wild eat mice, gerbils, and"," But to our surprise our 16-month fieldwork turned up no evidence that lions ever worked together during the annual cycle of family life. On the contrary, they divided their time between selfish pursuits - hunting alone for meat - and the narcissistic pleasures of exclusive company. What then is the purpose of this charade of herd behaviour? We suspect that the psychological appeal of the collective lion is the result of centuries of association with humans. For many thousands of years human hunters took prey from the wild, and lionized humans who lived in close relationship with these animals. This led to the psychological bonding that underpins modern zoo culture: humans take care of lions, play with lions, give lions toys and treat them as members of the family. It’s hard to see how this could have happened without centuries of coevolution. If the modern lion’s closest living relative is the domestic cat, one would expect its ancestors to have had much closer and longer association with humans, and so more evolved social skills. One might also anticipate that lions would have evolved traits to accommodate their association with human hunters. They might have learnt to trust and rely on human hunters, who could provide them with food and safety. Such evolutionary adaptations would be interesting to test. However the only fossils which suggest the existence of lion-like cats more than 10,000 years old were unearthed by archaeologists in East Africa. To date the most complete skeleton is of a lion found in Israel and dates back only to"," Contrary to our expectations, our research revealed that lions hunt individually for food, do not team up to hunt rear cubs and actually do not always roar in unison. It turns out that lions, just like most social animals, do not always work together towards a common goal. There is no reason to assume that lions work better as a team than they do alone. In fact, in many aspects lions are quite independent animals who lack the sense of group responsibility that makes them a social animal capable of working together. Our research also indicated that lions are capable of many individual and apparently unique behaviours, and it turns out that in some aspects they are even more independent than we had assumed. Lions are not just individuals: they are extremely variable in many aspects, and therefore the idea of ""one lion"" is quite misleading. In this sense the study of lions is still in its infancy. We suspect that our understanding of lions is still very much in its early stages. But we believe that more research into lions is essential for the conservation of both lions and humans. We also believe it is important because lions hold a unique place in human culture and mythology. Our knowledge of lions is so scant that when one book portrays lions in a particular way we tend to believe that is what lions are like. But it could be that the book is wrong. And we would be very happy if that were the case because knowledge of lions is so scant that it is just as likely that lions are very different from the"
"

The crew will spend about 30 days preparing the spacecraft and conducting scientific experiments, to gather valuable data to prepare for longer-term missions. They’ll also train for missions of a minimum of one year in the case of an unforeseen delay or disaster.

The second half of the mission will be entirely dedicated to the construction and launching of an urban habitation module. This module will be the main residence on Mars. Once complete, a third Mars mission will start to collect supplies to maintain the base for a minimum of three years, before returning to Earth.

The astronauts will live a very simple life with no modern technological equipment. This will be a step towards the goal of terraforming Mars. This process aims to put life on Mars similar to the one we have on Earth. By bringing nutrients to the planet, life will gradually evolve and eventually make it possible to support animal life.

During the return journey, the astronauts will perform a “sky dive” and return safely to Earth, which will be a technical demonstration of the spacecraft’s aerodynamic stability. The spacecraft’s parachutes will deploy at the same speed that the capsule will descend from the sky. The capsule will re-enter the atmosphere at a maximum height of 25 km, and will then disintegrate in a fireball. This demonstration of the spacecraft’s aerodynamic stability has been planned with the assistance of the United States Air Force.

The urban habitation"," The crew will live in micro-quests that will be added to the Red Planet after landing. Each crew member will carry personal mining equipment for the very first (small) collection of resources for humans to live off the land. This includes drillers, haulers and cranes. It also includes food that is already preserved in Mars-grown tomatoes, potatoes, lettuce and other vegetables. The spacecraft will be a complete mess, but that will provide ample opportunity for self-correction. Crew training will be conducted in micro-quests called ‘Sarcophagus City’. In the event of a real-world Mars mission failure, the crew will return to Earth in a re-entry capsule with the assistance of a nuclear reactor. They will use the radioactive waste to fuel a colony on the Moon that will last for centuries. The crew will also be pioneers of human presence on Mars and will be able to claim the ‘first foot’ on another planet.

* Name of the crew: The first-ever Martian astronauts will be male and female. They will have the following names: Tito and Suzy.

* The mission will last 501 days. The first day of the mission will be 1 January 2018 and the last day of the mission will be 30 September 2032.

* The spacecraft will weigh approximately 600 tons and the total mass of the crew is 350 tons.

* The total travel distance will be 250,000 kilometers (about 150"," 

For the mission to succeed, the following are necessary:

* The capsule and its payload will be designed and built by the Robonaut team at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.
* The mission must be scheduled within a window when Mars and Earth are close to each other, hence the requirement to know Earth’s gravitational field very accurately. 

An international team comprising the Robonaut team, private contractors and universities will develop a robust suit to enable astronauts to live on Mars for years. The suit’s main component will be the first complete “Spacecraft-In-A-Bottle” developed by Robonaut. A second suit component will be the first “Crew-Assist Robot” that enables one astronaut to take care of the daily care and monitoring of another astronaut. 

To return safely to Earth, the spacecraft will use the heat shield of a retired American satellite as an impact layer. To increase the chance of a safe return, the heat shield will be retro-fitted with a parachute and retro-rocket to decelerate the capsule in the atmosphere and allow it to be recaptured by the Navy’s Orbital Segment of the International Space Station.

One critical challenge is the Mars atmosphere, which will cause an oxygen deficiency and limit the amount of consumables such as water, oxygen or food that can be stored on board. Another is the impact of solar radiation on the heat shield.
"," The astronauts will stay in a specially built research laboratory on the Red Planet where they will work on vital areas like water preservation and extraction, greenhouse gas emissions, and human health and well-being while training the next generation of planetary scientists and engineers.

The couple will travel to Mars aboard the International Space Station – a highly effective solution which will allow a round trip of 501 days (23 months) and has a lower launch mass and therefore lower launch costs.

Dennis Tito is an American billionaire and the founder of online retail giant Amazon. His dream of getting humans to Mars was first proposed in the 2022 edition of the Flesch Kincaid reading level assessment but Tito was unable to attract enough financial backing to build a Mars habitat. After three years of persistence and the publication of a new book on Mars: Gateway to the Red Planet, he managed to convince space tourism companies to take a closer look at the project and the next funding round got the project off the ground.

The mission to Mars is to be supported by the European Space Agency and NASA.

As a secondary objective the Martian travellers will study the effect of Mars’s surface radiation. It is believed that human DNA will degrade over time and the radiation of the planet will accelerate this process, but Dennis Tito is convinced that his specially built space suit and a year-long stay on Mars will offer a solution to this problem.

The research centre will be called Mars City"," 

A mission to Mars, let alone a round trip, is a complex endeavor. Even with the technical know-how and funding, a Mars mission of any sort is bound to fail. In addition, the return journey requires the launch of a large amount of supplies that will need to be sent to Earth. The Mars atmosphere is also not known for its ideal pressure, temperature and composition. In addition, there are the political and ethical complications of venturing onto another planet and bringing a limited resource that supplies Earth’s most populous countries to it’s surface. These factors have dissuaded even private space agencies from pursuing a Mars mission. 

On the other hand, Mars One is a private organisation aiming to carry out a Mars mission in 2023. All in all, the project will cost about 8 billion euros to launch a two-person mission, which is far below both SpaceX’s estimate of 300 billion euros and the 2031 launch window, as they are aiming for to have a two-year margin. Moreover, the Mars One mission will be the first steps of a three-phase plan that will also include a mission to a binary system of two planets called “Two Sol. The plan is designed in a way that would ensure the survival of the human race if there is no alternative source of food and water. 

Both Mars One and SpaceX have their supporters and detractors, but if they are indeed able to carry out a one-off","

Mars Mission: The mission itself is a one-year round trip and involves construction of the habitats, collecting the materials for construction, testing each component, assembling the complex structures of the Mars base, and finally carrying out science experiments. After the one-year mission, the return capsule will bring back enough supplies to keep the crew alive for about 4 months on Earth.

The crew will consist of a pilot, a mechanic, and a psychiatrist, though any pair of married individuals is eligible to apply. They must be able to live and work together for at least 500 days, must be willing to travel to Mars, have a supportive spouse who will look after the children, and be at least 40 years old. They should be at least 6 feet tall and about 240 pounds, with a minimum age of 25 years and a maximum age of 45. The psychiatrist will be able to prescribe medication, but will not live on Mars.


Application instructions: Complete the application form with accurate personal data. Provide the psychiatrist with all requested medical and employment details. Finally, pay the application fee of US$2000. Once the application is received, a personal link to the online application will be sent via email. You will be asked to proceed to a pre-screening stage, where you will be given a report on your application and be asked to suggest improvements. If your application is accepted, you will receive instructions about payment and a final invoice.

" And even if you tax the item, not the person – meaning that more modern washing machines and fridges pay no tax at all, or less than they otherwise would – the total charge to households for this weekly ritual is small change. But to most families every small change matters.


The revenue derived from this service makes up less than 1% of what is collected nationally and is spent on things like new police cars, schools and hospitals. The remaining 98% is donated to charity.


Charity can certainly use it. As could families. By recycling four bags of rubbish into a bag of useful compost they could feed their own families more cheaply than they would by buying food at supermarkets. By doing a few bags themselves they could earn enough to clothe and feed a family of four more cheaply than they could buy food. They could also donate the leftover compost to farmers. In this world you can find a few family that do not pay any tax on the service they do. The trick is to make the service cost less than zero to the person that fills up a bin. If the charge for the service is only a few cents per bag of rubbish then the family that fills up a bin will not feel a cost and will keep doing it. It will feel a benefit, if not an outright gift, so will not notice that it is paying. They will continue to keep paying the small change that matters to them.


And here is where the environmental"," Some families dump all their refuse into one bin and pay a fortune for the service. Yet still others employ a team of workers who gather up all the bins in the vicinity and deposit their contents at the tip together. This latter arrangement seems to be popular with the well-off. It also produces far more recyclables than the old system: paper, plastics, glass etc all go into the same heap and can be reprocessed. It also reduces the amount of single-use plastics which enter the marine ecosystem and cause toxicity. The economists argue that if everyone had their own bins and took them to the same place there would be far less bin-laden trucks and a great deal of money saved. The ecological economists argue that the service is too costly and that there are better ways to recover the energy and materials necessary to produce the bins. They suggest that each household could employ a refuse collector: someone who would visit the homes of their friends and neighbours and collect the empty rubbish bins which had been left behind. They would be paid a modest sum to do this: a token gesture to demonstrate that the community still cares for its members. The economists would argue that this solution would be better for the environment, be more economically feasible and have lower running costs. The ecological economists are mostly ignored by the economists but their views are generally accepted by the general public, who prefer a system that is cheaper, equally efficient and avoids the potential problems of the other two options. So a token refuse collector is hired to"," The cost to families that dispose of less waste by volume is trivial.

The authors also point out that if we do not want to pay for waste then we do not have to produce more. We can simply not throw things away because they are useless or we can reduce the amount of stuff that we produce in the first place. They suggest that instead of charging families for each bag of rubbish we should simply charge the city for emptying the bins. This will encourage less stuff and will in turn encourage people to produce less.

In summary, A2 readers should note that the authors of this article believe that instead of charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce we should charge the city for emptying the bins. This will encourage less rubbish and will in turn encourage people to produce less. 

* A2 readers should understand that the article was written for A2 level students and has since been updated for A3 level students. 

* A3 readers should understand that the article's authors believe that in the modern world we should be producing less rubbish and recycling our waste instead. 

* A2 readers should note that the article provides no economic evidence for either claim and is clearly poorly argued. The claim that charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce is economically inefficient is at best poorly supported and at worst completely false. 

* A2 readers should also note that the article uses an appalling analogy comparing charging families for each bag of rubbish to charging the city"," This is odd to the Flesch Kincaid readier as Americans use the word ‘pay’ on 17% of garbage occasions (compared to a European average of 4%). Even stranger is that this community is charging those who produce the bags of rubbish for the privilege of contributing to the local tip. This is surely wrong. The bags of rubbish are the products of the responsible residents of the community and the tax payers who finance the service. The idea that the citizens of a society should pay for services in which they do not participate is untenable and in its extreme form is fascism. Communities that seek to co-fund services through taxation of individual performance are guilty of something worse than fascism: in this case they are engaged in the very unwholesome practice of moral licensing. It is morally wrong to demand of an individual that he/she perform a service which benefits the general community at his/her expense. If the service in question does not exist, the individuals moral obligation is not to provide it; it is to refrain from engaging in the immoral and unjust practice of compelling another to bear burdens which rightfully fall upon him/her. A service which is morally wrong because it does not benefit every individual, or because it benefits some individuals at the expense of others, cannot be legitimately co-financed through taxation. There is no moral, economic or ethical justification for charging for garbage bags. To do so is to engage in morally reprehensible"," The lorry then takes the waste away for recycling. Those who prefer not to use the bin choose to do so. Neither does the municipality bear the cost of the lorry. It is a free for all. The result is that some households empty four bins but fill only one or two. The empty bins lead to new bins. The new bins lead to additional bins. This cycle continues until the tip fills and a city is polluted with garbage. The opposite of this approach is to charge each household for its rubbish bag. In this world, household trash bags are expensive. It costs money to make the material for bags, to make the bags, and to market the bags to households. It also costs money for the trucks to collect the bags and take them away. A bag of rubbish would cost the households who produce it none. As a result the approach that simply charges each household for its rubbish bag would be economically sensible. To most families this seems economically sensible. It is environmentally sound. The city is not polluted with garbage. Garbage is still produced as people discard plastic bottles, paper, metals, and all manner of non-biodegradable and -compostable matter in their free-for-all bins. However households pay to take away their own trash. This is not desirable as it fosters a tradition of throwing away trash. Thus garbage in garbage out. One day the city will have to pay for this environmental sin. Then the families that are the tip of"," It seems odd that in a civilised society families would be rewarded for their messiness, even if that messiness could be reduced by picking up the extra bags. Perhaps it is unfair to expect families to clean up their act, as this implies the existence of something like a tidy household: a tidy house doesn't have bags of rubbish; it has nothing to discard. One could argue that we have been taught to expect regularity from the city: we expect that rubbish bags will be emptied once a week. In most places, a weekly refuse collection lends itself to a weekly collection of bags. While a weekly collection of bags may appear wasteful to economists, it is precisely this regularity that binds communities together in the city and provides stability.

The cost of this service is borne equally by all. Each family that throws out its refuse contributes to the waste stream. Reducing the amount of rubbish produced would reduce the amount of garbage in the waste stream. This would reduce the quantity of refuse that has to be carried to the landfill and use up the resource of trees that were felled to make the lorry that takes it away. However the service of taking away the bags of rubbish would no longer be provided for free. The economic sacrifice of one or two bags of rubbish per week would now need to be paid by households who currently get free service. If a community was to choose to make this sacrifice then the service it received from the municipal lorry would have to be paid for. One can imagine this might happen when one household becomes more wasteful than others. Charging the heavier bin users for each bag of rubbish they produce would be a fair way to ensure that everyone continued to get the free service they now enjoy. As to the environment, the service would no longer be ecologically viable if there were insufficient tree resources to transport the refuse to the landfill. While the charges might be modest they could ensure that the service stayed within the bounds of acceptability. A fair amount of money would go into the local economy through the payment of lorry drivers, waste management and refuse"
" I made my way to the middle of the cordoned off area. There was a small group of 5-6 participants. I started to get interested. I would be honest and say that I am not much of a sports fan. I do not follow any sport and find the concept of being a spectator to be distasteful and unwelcome. Therefore, the fact that a small group of people are willing to spend their own money and resources to play a fun sport for a living is not just interesting, its downright amazing. Goat Racing. Not the kind that you can have on Cabbage Patch. The sport you can have here. It's fast. Its real fast. I don't know the exact rules, but from what I heard from people competing. Goats are fitted with a device that sends a signal to a sensor worn on the back of the rider. The device measures the rider's speed, power, lateral agility and reaction time. The goal is to keep the goats distance and stay out of the way of the goatherd in the process. The goats are actually quite the adrenaline junkie. Some go home with bruises. It starts at Easter Monday. No one knows exactly how the sport got started. Who knows. But there it is. I'm here for it now. Goats, fast and fun. Who doesn't like that?

I was so close to getting to see goat racing I could taste it. This is"," The starters would then set off and would be followed by a group of runners who would then have the task of covering the ground as quickly as possible to win the race. This I thought was very interesting. The competitors were dressed in goat's foot-gear, horns and all. My immediate neighbours seemed to know each other. They were clearly a group that would stick together. I watched as a few sprinters flew past, some with speed to kill, I mean kill for speed. One sprinter though seemed to be struggling to get up the energy to overtake his more experienced fellow runners. I went over to say hi to him and offered him some of my frozen caper berries. I said that it helped if they were frozen. I must have struck a bit of a sour note and he responded with a quick kick to my shin. A small cry from me and I felt a sharp pain in my foot. I looked down and a drop of blood had appeared. I told him I had been waiting for this to happen. I'm going to need to get some bearberry for my frozen berries. It wouldn't do for me to have that stain on my dress!

As I thought about the encounter I couldn't help but remember a conversation I'd had with the local baker, Mr Brown. He asked me about my job. I said I was a teacher and he responded with a quip about how he thought the teachers in the village were doing their best with"," A race was underway. Two goats with goofy hats, a goat with a helmet, an Arabian and an African, two adults with two kids all charging around the field. The goat that seemed to be winning turned out to be the goat wearing the helmet. The race got delayed for a bit, the adult goat and the kid did a 180 degree u-turn and started charging straight towards me. They had to have been travelling at least 10km/h, even though the race had officially begun. My initial thought was to get the hell out of there but I was frozen solid and in too much of a hurry to make a decision. I have never been so thankful to have had my eardrums protected by an ice-cream van. The adult goat and kid arrived at a complete stop. The kid looked up at me and started panting really hard. I got out of my van and asked if everything was okay. 'Yeah sure, the goat won. No sweat, it's goat racing.' The kid took a few more steps and I realised he had an arrow in his side. It was stuck. 'Get some ice!' I commanded and the ice-cream van started to melt again, but by then the kid had collapsed from loss of blood and I had to call an ambulance. The ambulance arrived, but when they were about to start working the kid passed away. The ambulance men put the kid into a body bag and started crying. I offered to take"," The first rider to go by was well past half a mile an the crowd erupted into a standing ovation for the rider and the crowd followed suit. After a few more riders went by a crowd chant was heard from one side of the area ""Come on Stamford"" and from the other side the chant changed to ""Come on Chelmsford"" Chelmsford was the runner up the year before and was not well received in the crowd.  As the first rider came past the cheer diminished and the chant changed to ""Come on Stamford""  the rider had taken the lead but in the distance and when Chelmsford came into view the cheering turned to jeers.  The rider came into view and the crowd quietened down until Stamford was within easy reach but there were no cheers this time, just jeers.  The rider had done it again, taken the lead but in the distance. The rider came into view again and cheers broke out, these grew stronger and then Stamford rode into view and there was a standing ovation, cheers that turned to thunder and in the distance we could see Chelmsford, they turned their heads to see what all the excitement was about and then a cheer went up, they were neck and neck and Chelmsford had taken the lead again. The crowd settled down, Stamford was clearly in control but then in a move no doubt calculated to beat the crowd into silence, Chelmsford suddenly"," The competitors are dressed in traditional goat clothing and are herded onto the track by a committee of goat daddies. There were four competitors. In terms of pace one would consider a trot or canter to be a leisurely pace. The competitors race round the track in four separate groups. A goat that ran twice round the track would be declared the winner. The first group to cross the line would be the winner. The second group would be the winner. The third group would be declared runner up. The fourth group would be declared third place. The first group completed the course in approximately the correct time. The second group completed the course in approximately the incorrect time. The third group completed the course in approximately the correct time. The fourth group completed the course in approximately the incorrect time. This outcome represents a loss for the goat racing committee.


* Goat Racing II: I missed goat racing. I did witness goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. This time I fought my way though the crowds more effectively and successfully. I elbowed my way through the vans and hordes of people. Music was not blasting through my ears. But still the crowd was more organized. I managed to find a spot close to the racecourse. I was standing and hoping when a goat would come and visit me near the crowd. Then suddenly I witnessed goat racing for real. A goat came running by. Then another goat. Then a third goat. Then goats"," Some twenty to thirty runners were taking part. Most were on their own, but a couple of horses were in harness. The horses were pulling a pair of trailer-ponies who carried the runners as they strode steadily towards the finish line which was marked by a post and a plaque. At the finish the crowd erupted in cries of joy, though whether at the winning horse or the winning driver I could not be sure. I looked around and noticed a couple of kids my own age with their parents and I was struck by the contrast. The parents were clearly having a good time but I was starting to get a little too hot myself - and not just because of the sun. By now my ears were feeling slightly sticky and I realized I'd been screaming without thinking. ""Go Goats, Go Goats"" they all shouted. I looked around again. No doubt they'd picked up on my dithering. I could see two small children in a push-chair scowling at me. My stomach felt like it was coming unknotted and my legs started to wobble. My parents were right behind me so I turned to face them. ""It's not a race,"" I said, ""it's for fun"" ""Oh, that's a nice way to see it then,"" my mother replied.

The competitors; a large crowd of goat, goat kid, goat kidlet, goat kidlettes, goat jockey with a number of fans/spectators. The first goat race was about to get underway. 

The crowd settled down and I began to watch the proceedings taking it in turns to select my next treat; my parents now joined me. I looked around to see if I could identify the jockey, she looked to be an amateur judging by her style of racing. I soon identified that she had a goat kid on her arm;  they were off. The kid was a novice, its neck was extended as it raced along and could be seen bobbing up and down as the race went on. The amateur jockey was not riding with any great skill, however from what I could make of it she was either just beginning or new to goat racing; this seemed like a good reason for my son to take an interest in it.

Still, the growing reliance on oral evidence is justified in cases where the information sought is of an anecdotal or even ephemeral nature. The historian may thus be looking for traces of the past which are long gone and may have existed only in the form of oral accounts. The historian who neglects to get an oral account of an event is in danger of losing traces of the past forever. If he or she had taken the trouble to get an oral account, it could turn out to be the most valuable source of information, even though it has been distorted by the dynamics of the situation in which it took place or simply forgotten. But the historian must not ignore written evidence. Without it, he or she is reduced to nothing more than a recorder of what someone else has written.

Oral accounts of the past tend to be biased and in this era when information is difficult to come by, they have a greater value. It seems clear that historians should therefore rely on both written and oral sources in their quest for information.

1. Written sources

Archaeological remains provide objective evidence of past human existence, customs, laws, social organizations and religious cults. The findings of archaeology may throw light on past civilizations but cannot replace the testimonies of former inhabitants of the area, many of whom have perished or who are not able to speak coherently or have never bothered to write down their observations.

2. Oral sources

The"," 

The oral historian must accept the historicity of the documentary evidence he or she uses and avoid ascribing to it an objective character contrary to the intentions of its framers. Oral history has its advantages and it will remain a central part of historical research so long as the researcher has not imposed categories of thinking that have dominated the field for decades, like the objectivist and subjectivist positions, in other words so long as he or she adheres to the materialist paradigm. These categories, as developed by Auguste Comte, Karl Marx and others, are founded on the idea that the study of human activity is possible only by means of observation which, because it is of an external nature, can only lead to the externalization of social categories. History, on the other hand, is the study of events which have determined the course of human action and so requires a critical attitude toward categories which prevent the analysis of these events.

As a result, the study of oral history must also acknowledge the objective character of its objects. To this end, the researcher will need to devise an attitude of awareness of the subject’s intentions, which he or she will need to demonstrate to the subject and make him or her feel that it is a conscious attitude adopted for a positive purpose. This attitude will consist in asking probing questions to which the subject can give straightforward answers. This attitude implies assuming that the historian and the person he or she interviews have a common history and that their opinions are not totally"," The same can be said of historians who rely on documents. To counter this problem of reliance on evidence that is not necessarily factual (or even factual), the following recommendations have been put forward:   
– The historian should not rely exclusively on documents nor should they be the sole basis for a historical analysis. 
  
– They should use a combination of various types of evidence, such as documentary evidence, oral evidence, and other secondary sources such as encyclopaedia articles and the like. 

– Oral history is particularly helpful for analysing historical periods and events that are not adequately covered by documents. In this situation, historians should endeavour to identify people with first-hand experience of the topic under study and request them to share their experiences. Oral history is a valuable method for obtaining non-written information, although it has its problems too. 

– Oral history can be conducted by interviewing individuals who are well known in the field or by conducting focus groups with a representative sample of historians, graduate students and members of the general public with appropriate attention to diversity and inclusion.

Oral history is a valuable method for obtaining non-written information. It can help scholars gain insights into the history of a subject area that are not adequately represented by written sources or allow scholars to get a better understanding of the culture, values, traditions, customs and history of a particular society through oral testimony, for example,  interviews with people with first-hand experience of the topic under study."," A historian who relies solely on oral evidence is not truly seeking the truth of the matter in hand because her or his own agenda is involved.

This passage is not balanced, because it is premised on the assumption that the historian must ensure that the informant has no social position different from the historian’s, because the social position will shape the manner in which the informant explains and talk about the past. In contrast, Flesch Kincaid grades 2, 3 and 4 do not require the historian to ensure that the informant has no social position different from the historian’s, because this would require the historian to ensure that the informant has no social position different from the general population. It can be shown that Flesch Kincaid has been found to have the following properties:

1. The simpler the writing, the worse Flesch Kincaid grades 2, 3 and 4 are. This is because a simple writing requires the reader to read the same syllable (e.g. ‘the’, ‘a’) many times across a document, whereas the Flesch reading grade does not take into account the number of times the syllable is repeated (e.g. ‘the a’).

2. The greater the number of syllables in the word or phrase that are used in a simple writing, the worse Flesch Kincaid grades 2, 3 and 4 are. This is because a word or phrase composed of a large number","

This raises the problem of how far historians should rely on oral evidence, or rather, on oral histories. There are good grounds for believing that the testimony of individuals is not an ideal medium for learning. There are, for example, several situations in which testimony is unreliable, such as cases of abuse. On the other hand, it is difficult to use historical testimony to establish general principles and to test hypotheses.

It is clear that historians should never simply accept oral histories as unquestioned. On the contrary, they should use oral and written sources together in order to reach a better understanding of past social and economic events. In particular, historians should adopt a two-stage method:

a) They should collect oral and written evidence. This evidence should be subjected to controlled tests and systematic checks.

b) They should rely only on oral and written evidence where appropriate (for instance where testimony is reliable, and where evidence from other sources cannot be used) in order to draw general conclusions and test hypotheses.

However, there is also the danger that historians will over-rely on oral evidence, possibly to the detriment of more systematic and controlled research which they could have done using different methods.

Therefore, historians should take care to distinguish between the two sources, and use both carefully, with a view to ensuring that the reliability of each source is guaranteed, but also to ensuring that the analysis and conclusions reached are not unduly biased by the testimony provided by a single","

The ideal, as any good historian knows, would be to have first-hand experience of the subject and to make one’s own deductions; unfortunately, such experience has not been universal: in general, we are faced with the problem of how to interpret testimony given by a large number of individuals, most of whom have not shared in the debates at which they were trained.

One approach to the problem is to make statistical judgements using frequency distributions derived from the data, as was done by  George E. Marcus in his book Oral Historians (1964).  Marcus was able to show a correspondence between an individual historian’s relative frequency of use of certain terms in the text and that term’s frequency in other historiographic works.  This approach was followed by Philip A. Kuhn in the 1970s in the field of family history; using the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Scales and Word Segregation Index as a guide, he constructed “reading rubrics” to help readers of oral histories to extract the useful information from the often incomprehensible accounts.  His approach has, as he notes, been much criticized, but, in any case, Marcus’s approach has not been followed and so we are again faced with the problem of how to deduce the relevant information from the testimony provided by many individuals without any direct knowledge of the debate.

As we saw in Chapter 2, the Flesch-Kincaid"," In such an atmosphere the historian’s research and understanding are inevitably bound to suffer from the presence of the ‘other’ and an element of arbitrariness. The historian may still hope that his or her research will stand up to the light of critical reflection and that the text he or she has written can be separated from the other factors which have contributed to the interpretation. In many cases this is not possible. Even when the text is written in good faith and does not contain factual errors or contradictions it is very difficult to avoid the influence of the context in which it was produced, the prejudices and values of the researcher and the problems he or she has faced in conducting the research. The oral dimension of historical research and the social and cultural conditioning of the actors involved have to be taken into account. As the historian approaches the subject of an oral phenomenon he or she is liable to adopt a first, simplified version of the phenomenon. The testimony of a single witness, no matter how experienced, does not allow for a detailed reconstruction of a particular event. The historian has to rely on other sources, for instance, written documents, to complete a picture of the event and so he or she has to consider all the materials which have contributed to the reconstruction and the different points of view which may have been adopted. In his or her research the historian must try to avoid bias and follow the facts as closely as possible. The text which results is necessarily conditioned by what the historian was able to include and by"
" 

‘Never.’ he said, taking the sugar bowl. ‘Never. Just leave it out.’ and she left it out. And he started to make coffee which was very good. 

And she thought: I think he is getting addicted to sugar. He hasn’t had sugar in years. But she didn’t say anything. For her part she had, in the interim, noticed a number of odd and distressing side-effects including an inability to remember small things. She also began to worry that his ‘never’ might have been an exaggeration and that there might actually be a place for sugar in his regime.

The author would suggest some caution and negotiation with regard to his own eating habits, especially with regard to sugar. It would be well to ask him whether he would like to return to the way things used to be, without sugar, with a view to negotiation on the question of whether he should return to the way things used to be without sugar. If he says yes, you must take his word that he will go back to the way things used to be without sugar. Should he then say he will return to the way things used to be without sugar, you should take this as a very firm no and tell him so. But you should not insist upon his returning to the way things used to be without sugar. He should be free to make his own decisions about what it is he likes and enjoys. If he prefers the way things used to"," And now this. The coffee machine.  And she didn’t answer the question did she? Just nodded as though in agreement - although in truth her silence had been anything but assent’.

'That would be fine thanks she had said without waiting for further prompting and now with the coffee in front of him he took a sip - a sip he could not seem to bring himself to swallow so much as a drop, a sip to demonstrate just how fine and strong it was without the use of sugar, a sip to be taken while remaining perfectly still in order to avoid messing up the delicate pouring mechanism as well as the fragile paper cups themselves, a sip which did not show any signs of remaining unchanged in volume or temperature even after twenty minutes had passed and he had returned to his former position behind his desk again. Sipped, sipped, sipped and when the twenty minutes had passed he went through the motions of getting up to put the cups in the dishwasher.

'Well I do say that's hardly the worst thing I’ve ever heard', he declared when he returned to his desk.

'It's not, it’s not', she agreed.

 'What’s worse though is when she said it was ""all sugar free"".'

'All sugar free'

 'I mean come on - there are only ten cups in there and they can’t all be sugar free.'

 'Well technically they are - because"," He would have happily retired from all that had not the need to be there with them outweighed the benefits of being at the coal face in his own work so he continued.  - 'no, I don't,' he called back. 'Why?', said the secretary. 'because I have high blood pressure. I need to cut down on my sugar intake. I saw the packet.' 'Oh, ok. I'll make a note of that,' she said but didn't go near the packet because he had already left and she hadn't realised the importance of this new development. In fact no-one realised the importance of this new development and the only one who even noticed him leaving was the new secretary who he had hired for the summer. But she had noticed him leaving and she had a very busy schedule. 'It's not my problem,' she said, 'you keep asking me to do things and when I do it you are unhappy with the outcome. It's never gonna work.' And with that she switched the phone off. It was the right thing to say. The phone call was that secretary, he remembered that now. What he couldn't remember was the time or the person he'd called or of course the caller had said what he'd said. And anyway in his present situation this didn't really matter. What really mattered was that she had turned off her phone - probably while he was in the throes of composing some carefully considered response. He had been thinking about"," He realised now that he should probably take sugar with his coffee so he added six tablespoons, but at the same time wondered if that was what the secretary had meant.

At work he was known as Lancelot, in his spare time he was a wizard, and in his private life he was the star of a TV series which was still on the air although he wasn’t sure whether it was still being watched. This sounded less like his real life, more like a work of fiction, but if his private life had been a work of fiction he would have been very good at that and it would never have entered into his plans to be a wizard. That was one of the things that he could see was lacking in his private life. The other thing was something which actually interested him quite a lot which was writing - more than his real life, actually, because his real life wasn’t that interesting. He had wanted to be a writer since he was a kid. His mother had insisted on it because he had been reading books about knights and wizards. He had even applied to the local college of wizards but they had told him he was more of a counselor than a wizard so he hadn't gone to college. He had always just assumed that they had meant it was his talent for words, not actually what words he used.

But writing this TV series was the real goal and he had made it work. The series wasn’t exactly selling anyhow"," For a start, he wasn’t a dog and secondly, he was not a secretary. He was also, according to his children a necessary evil for which they would accept a weekly stipend - a rather more positive view of the situation than their father accepted. “Oh, of course I don’t,” he called out rather louder this time, in the hope of being listened to more intently than before. “I don't take sugar.” He said more loudly still. He’s not making coffee for you so why should I? His secretary replied haughtily that she had been making coffee for him for many months and she’d forgotten what was a courtesy. He wasn’t rude about it but now he considered she’d better look around for a sugar bowl if she was to continue. “Oh and why should I?” she retorted. “You’re there to do a job for me! You don’t just pop in for a coffee and expect it to be on the go every day.” She was right of course; he was a busy man and not even his children could do the job of finding sugar for him every day. She sighed with resignation, picked up his laptop and phone from the coffee table where he’d left them only moments before and slunk out. “See you tomorrow,” she muttered darkly under her breath as the door closed softly behind her. He smiled in satisfaction. I’m going to enjoy this, he"," In short, he realised with sinking heart that he was in the middle of a crisis of confidence, the first of several, in which everything seemed to be going wrong. He supposed he just didn’t want to leave. And not for the first time. And not ever.

The reason for this morning's coffee was not far to seek. He had just returned from the theatre where his one-man play, which he considered his crowning achievement in the role, was being performed for a paying audience. They had sat through four hours of recitation interspersed with standing ovations. He had been well received by the critics and audience and it had paid for the journey home (which was actually necessary) to indulge a bit longer in the luxury of a solitary cup of coffee.  Although the playwright knew and loved the playwright, he knew also that there had been nothing like it done before - so there was no precedent.  This was not just because the playwright possessed no knowledge or inspiration to go beyond the experience of a lifetime of self-indulgence (which he did) but also because there were no plays for adults on the anvil. His publisher's notion of a modern 'comedy of manners' was to be commended although his opinion (which he would share in due course) was that it was actually a rather pallid and pallidly presented version of a sentimental morality play.  It would do very nicely for an afternoon's diversion in"," A couple of weeks earlier he had gone for the jugular, not by stabbing his dog but by phoning in a false emergency request to get out early to supervise the placement of an item that looked too big to fit in a small bin - and had made all his colleagues stay late, as if he could help but if a key player made a mistake he could probably help rectify it by watching the tape of a rehearsal. It had been an excellent rehearsal and he had made a few useful suggestions.'

" She knew it would all be replaced, that it was needed, all of it, for what now? She had a strong desire to live in the new house she had seen in the newspaper, an architect’s design of a glass box in the English countryside. 

It was a dream to have such windows looking out over the English countryside. She looked at the paper again more closely and noticed that one part of the new house was not in the picture. She went down the street to the architect who she knew she could trust and asked for a tour. She pointed at the empty space in the plans and asked ‘Where is this? I thought you’d have that room ready for me?’ He laughed and said ‘oh, that’s the ‘garden room’, the chef will need a kitchen in the new house. I have already designed his kitchen, with his own unique twist, we have worked closely together, he loves this house, he loves you, and he trusts me, I know this is what he wants.’ Susan returned home defeated, her heart heavy at the prospect of leaving the children and having to leave everything she knew. As she drove down the street to the local Tesco’s she asked herself ‘why me?’

Fred rang the doorbell and Susan heard the sound of a few keys being inserted into a lock. She knew then she had been stood there too long. When the door finally opened Fred had one final grin for Susan and his team then strode back down the driveway to his van as the music from the television echoed across the quiet harbour. SIGH. But one day… Susan smiled to herself, one day her own house will be cleared out by strangers, leaving her to move into a smaller apartment… but no tears this time.

Removal days are quite common in the home movings out and are typically a festive occasion when most of your belongings are packed up and sent to a place of storage/storage facility. The Removal Day story helps children realise that families used to their present circumstances are different and that they will likely experience a Removal Day at some point in their lives.

He said ‘will this one be alright?’ he nodded.  She said ‘and the rest of the boxes?’ he nodded and said ‘let’s go’. He then said ‘I’ll get that for you’ he handed her a small black bag.  She opened it and a little green cricket hit the man in the face and then she was in her own bed and the cricketing green cricket was on the floor, the man rubbed his face. Fred the removal man was now laughing wildly his entire team, including the man who had been hit by the cricket, joined in.

Susan thought to herself “now I’ll never get that house back” and began to cry.  

But in the morning the house had still been there, the cricket was on the floor and Fred was still laughing.

The only thing which reminds her of her calling. She now understands why the house was called Removal Day and feels saddened for her leaving. “What now Susan?” she asks “After all these years I am still the housekeeper” she thought to herself “What now Susan?” “ I’ll start a new life” she said aloud to herself as she gathered her small possessions and a few pictures of her children which she will keep. Fred the removal man smiled politely, one of the advantages of his enormous hands being that he could do many things at once. “Its settled then Susan” he said “I’ll start the hire truck from the van at your house tomorrow at 9am” he replied with the authority of someone who knows exactly what he is doing. Susan nodded gratefully as Fred continued to tidy up the boxes which he had stacked neatly in the vans boot, she watched in disbelief as he was about to take one last look around, as he looked up she was gone and he was left with a slight sense of loss and an even more overwhelming sense of loss. “Good riddance” he thought to himself as he stuffed newspapers around the empty space. “I’ll miss her though Fred” he thought as he heard a rustle and the door opening as Susan stepped out into the sunlight and into her future.

Fred was wrapping the piano her husband had given her for their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, Susan felt they should have had a small party to celebrate. In the end Fred said he could not do the piano at once so Susan packed Fred a bowl of raisins in his delivery and left it by the piano. Fred asked what would be done with all these boxes Susan had put in the garage? Fred said he had heard that property developers and government departments would benefit from empty boxes and asked Susan to leave one in a box in the box room for the van to drop off, Fred said it was in his contract. Susan agreed but was distracted at the window where the van was now turning into the drive the van which has been there her whole life now a friend of many years was rolling down the drive and turning into the garage.

" “Is that a dinosaur?’ he said as the image showed a tyrannosaurus rex. ‘No, that’s a camel,’ said the dad. He smiled and explained it was a similar looking species but the son wasn’t satisfied with this answer. ‘What about a dinosaur?’ the son asked. ‘I’ve told you loads of times, there aren’t any anymore, they’re extinct’ said the dad. ‘Oh come on dad, I know you are a scientist but you can’t say that!’ said the son. ‘It’s true. Look, I’ll show you on the internet, look on wikipedia, they’ve got loads of pictures of dinosaurs and they are all real’. The son then got very upset. It was clear he didn’t understand that this was the internet and what he was seeing was only one possibility amongst many. This is where screen learning can go wrong. What if it’s not engaging the child sufficiently and what if the internet is not providing enough new information? The father was convinced that this interactive approach was the way to go and tried it himself, reading from the screen and answering his own son’s questions. The result was not pretty. The son was now looking at pictures on the screen and did not want to look at his father. ‘Come on dad, I want to see the dinosaur!’ he cried. The dad tried again. This time he said he"," Not for long! His son began to point out all the items and explained how they worked. There was general agreement around this, and soon they were having a laugh in the process. 

It could be argued that Screen Learning is not the panacea that all learning organisations would like to subscribe to. Learning happens face-to-face and through in-person, group and personalised experience. Learning that is facilitated by a screen requires a minimum of people in order to operate and is not a substitute for face-to-face. It is not a substitute for teaching and learning in a genuine sense. It may be a complement. The advantage of Screen Learning however is that the screen allows for remote and asynchronous learning. Interactive programmes using pictures and text require minimal people and are easily accessible at any time, no matter where in the world you may be. 

Learning by Screen Learning A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. ‘I’m a little dinosaur’ he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was not a lot. There is a modish rush to embrace internet and computer learning but is learning via a screen a good method? One writer tells how he tried out an interactive programme with his son. The father diligently read the words while the"," ‘This is why I went online to find out how computers work’ said the son to his father. The son was right – but it took ages. In conclusion – it is good to look up stuff via a screen but kids learn best in an experiential way so stick with traditional learning methods like reading books, playing outside and interacting with adults.  


We live in the information age. The rise of the internet and computer technology has created a plethora of educational resources that is difficult to discover and understand without the use of technology.  Screen learning is growing in popularity because it offers the ability to be actively involved in the learning process.  Screen learning works well for concepts that are difficult to understand in isolation or require a bit of thinking around the topic before it will make sense. It’s important to remember though that screen learning can be like browsing the internet.  It can be very fast but often require you to skim the text without fully absorbing it.  The key is to use technology in a purposeful way, for example to read text out loud or ask questions.  Screen learning is no substitute for live teaching but can complement it.  One way to think about screen learning is like exercise for your mind.  It requires physical activity like going for a walk to stimulate the brain, but most importantly you need to be looking for opportunities to use your new found fitness.  The final lesson of this narrative is that it’s important to combine technology with traditional learning methods"," In this case, the child did not notice any difference. However, other parents are now using technology to support and enhance their children’s education. Mobile devices allow parents to monitor their children’s screen time and also to access educational videos, games and activities. Mobile learning also offers interactive textbooks that can be customized to each child’s needs. On the other hand, technology has also been identified as a potential threat to children’s well-being. It is now difficult to separate the positive educational use of technology from the potential harm of cyberbullying and addictive activities that can be found online. Another interesting aspect of the technology, is the wide diversity of the applications that one can choose to download. This opens up learning to a wider range of skills and subject matters. Many educationalists and parents now agree that all children should be using technology to learn and that its use should be monitored. One positive development in mobile learning in China is that the government is introducing subsidies for schools to purchase electronic devices for students. By 2022, mobile phones will be available free of charge for all students. China is now trying to catch up with other countries in terms of providing better and quality education to its citizens. In a few years’ time, China’s educational results could surpass those of the United States. China will have a head start in mobile learning and might even surpass US in 2030. In summary, the impact of technology on children’s learning is still to be fully explored. It offers"," Finally the boy was able to get the words and pronounce them correctly: ‘Dinosaur’ ‘It lived at the end of the world and was huge.’ The writer was surprised that he had found it easy to remember these words, whereas he was struggling with his son’s pronunciation. He wondered if this was because the boy was reading from a screen and so did not get enough physical involvement. Perhaps the screen had distracted his son? It may also have helped that the programme had the capacity to test the child’s knowledge, for example by asking them what dinosaurs ate. The next day the boy was excited to visit the dinosaur museum. The story highlights how one parent struggled to remember how to pronounce words with the son because he was spending too much time looking at pictures. On the other hand, perhaps the parent was too focussed on the pronunciation and did not invest enough time into seeing what the boy was doing. The programme had the potential to help the child learn some basic words and was good for testing knowledge.

"," By the end of 10 minutes, the boy had learned the word ‘colour’. So, as they say, it can be done. Is reading via a screen really so much more difficult than any other method? In 2010, the American computer scientist Geoffrey A. F. Hinton and the University of Toronto's Liang Chen, in collaboration with two other scientists, published a large-scale evaluation of how well children learn from computers.[1] The study involved 3,656 4th to 6th grade children from across the United States who were taught basic arithmetic through a computer algorithm (written in Python), through a tutor, or without using any support material. The researchers tested the children on their ability to perform basic arithmetic calculations and found that the algorithm performed significantly better than the tutor or no support material. While the study involved children learning from computers, it did not attempt to compare reading comprehension via computer or reading from a book. The team also studied how various factors could affect a computer's learning ability, including: the child's age, the algorithm difficulty, the child's prior knowledge, and the child's enjoyment of the experience. The authors concluded that despite the success of the algorithm in this study, significant improvements in computer reading instruction are likely needed before computers can be considered a valid substitute for books in children's education. 

Screen Learning As the study suggests, interactive learning materials performed better than'reading from a book'. While reading via a screen may not be much more difficult than any other"," The boy quickly stopped paying attention when the father put the images on hold and started talking. 
Learning from screens is one of the popular methods for today’s generation who like instant answers. In his book ‘Screencap’ Malcolm Harris states that “there is no better way to learn than to watch someone else (learner) in action (device)”.  A digital device such as a PC or laptop offers a learning facilitator but screens offer no hands-on experience. The screen becomes the learner’s teacher. The devices also encourage fast memorisation using short cuts. 

Screencap 
Malcolm Harris says “there is no better way to learn than to watch someone else(learner) in action”. A2 learners may not fully understand the concept being taught via screens, as they may tend to be basic learners. They may well have been taught via screens but not fully understand what was being taught. Hence for A2, text should be explicit, short and should use limited number of information points. 
Screencaps, video lessons etc can be learnt using devices like laptops and PCs. While these devices offer a rich platform, it is the learners themselves who actually learn via the screens. The devices provide a platform but the learners must put the skills into practise in the form of action (using the screens). 
Use of screens for learning can be effective for some subjects. An example is a software engineer who learns to read code using"
" A huge piece of wood is placed on a workbench and a large lathe with a long rotating arm arrives. Two builders, both sporting tattooed arms and pierceless ears, start to talk you through the design of the frame and its components. The first builder explains how the frame is made from a log which has been kiln-dried and then bamboo-fiber glued together. They have built hundreds of bikes with this method, but are aiming to build this frame especially for me as I’m the only non-engineer in the group. The builder starts by splitting the log using a huge circular saw. A lathe will be used to machine two parts of the frame from the remaining wood. Once both frames are complete the builder will start the gluing process. They will be using a green glue, but will show me how to apply the perfect, even line of Bondoil and leave it to dry for 24 hours. The glue mixture is then sprayed onto the frame with an airless paint sprayer, so that it fills the channels between the wood and bonds well. After the glue dries, the frame is ready for the bicycle paint-job. I look on in confusion as the builder walks me through how to paint the frame. I point out to him that this is not paint, it is green glue which has dried, and I am still confused by his explanation. But once the paint dries, the frame is ready for the first bolt. The"," As the instructor, James Marr, points out the frame has been designed for the latest British standard with Shimano brakes, Campag shifters and a coaster brake. We are also given all the tools and spares needed to build our chosen frame: a set of ballpeen hammers, a set of pliers, a set of needle-nosed pliers, needle threader, crochet needle, nylon cable ties, wire cutters, wire stripper and glue stick. The materials are a set of bamboo saws, an electric hot plate and bamboo skewers. We choose a frame design, and James begins to cut and assemble a frame shell. He explains the frame will be made from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP), which is strong, light and very strong. Using the templates we have been given, and following the blueprint, we assemble the first frame part – a tube with a seatpost and seat tube, and chainstay length. The frame shell is completed and fitted with spacers between the tubes. It is the spacers which allow the tubes to move slightly in the moulding process; without them the frame would be useless. The course continues in this fashion over the weekend, and on Saturday night we assemble the finished bike. The final bike of the weekend will be the winner of a raffle that evening. We choose one frame to take home, and the whole family gathers to ride it out of"," Two men on a bench watch intently. A third is perched on the edge of a box of screws, looking worried. He’s a new arrival to the club, a guy from India who has come along to learn. He’s still in his track pants and T-shirt and after the first few minutes his enthusiasm is infectious. He bends down, shows me a drill bit that he has brought with him and asks me if I’d like to inspect the work so far. In the background we hear Ian, the course designer, describing what the bike frame will look like in detail. A few minutes later he brings a pair of leather gloves, holds my hand out, and slowly wraps it around the smooth outer tube of the frame. “There’s nothing like the smell of a fresh bamboo pipe after a long winter,” he says with a smile. The newbie from India takes the gloves and begins to bend the tube in the direction of the smile. He starts by cutting and bending the pipe just above my knuckles, and his smile grows wider. We inspect his handiwork and his satisfaction at finally being part of something special is clear.  

The club’s mission is to educate the next generation of bike builders, and what started as a weekend project at Hackney Wick’s Greenwich Bike Company, has grown into a fully fledged school.  

The club has built its reputation on a hands-on approach, starting"," Three bikes line up alongside one another on the floor of the room. These are not ordinary bikes, they’re the first of what will be many, many prototypes built by the club’s members. James Marr, a professor at Kingston University, shows me a screen of CAD (computer-aided design) files which create the final shape of the frame, from measurements taken with Lidar laser scanning device. This is then sent to a 3D printer, a machine that builds up solid objects layer by layer out of plastic pellets, for the job of making these frames by hand would be too time-consuming and costly. The Lidar device was developed by the University of Westminster, who James’s company Kingston University are affiliated to. “They’re fantastic to work with”, James says, with a broad smile. He then takes a bike he has already built and fits it together: “This is for me as a student and this is for me as a professional engineer, it’s just a really good combination of price and quality.” He checks that the brakes work. I inspect a bike by James’s colleague Ian McMillan. The bike is a Specialized Tarmac, a high-end mountain bike with a price tag of around £1,000. The idea is that the club members will be able to use the Bamboo Bike Club name to get their bikes built by expert engineers at this price point. James tells me they’re"," As a bike, it’s certainly got character. With local knowledge of the bike trade and a local network of suppliers a bike of this quality could be replicated in three to six months. 

Build it yourself is repeated multiple times in the story to create a sense of excitement and optimism in the learners that the course could be replicated.

By repeating the phrase “Build it yourself” in the narrative the learner will be reminded of the course that could be recreated through a local network.

The final phrase of “Britain's only bamboo bike-building course” is not only a message to the learner, but also a message to the EU reader and a possible counter to the narrative of the UK being in the process of leaving the EU.

"," In a dark corner, James and Ian stand among their bikes and tools. Ian’s a designer at BBRG, a pioneering company that’s been studying bamboo bikes for decades. He’s helped create computer-designed frames that cut carbon and weigh as much as steel bikes. He’s even used bamboo to create a carbon-fiber bicycle frame for the Tour de France.

James, a retired car engineer, has been designing his own bamboo bikes for nearly ten years, and is the course leader. He’s very hands-on, lending a hand in the workshop and a sharp eye for detail on the bikes being built. James has an engineer’s deep knowledge of how bicycles work, and how they’re built from the frame, the wheels, and the components around them. He points out a bike we’ve seen before:  

It’s a 2014 Raleigh road bike with some updates like an integrated handlebar bag and Shimano Deore brakes. There’s also a small touch – a bamboo handlebar. 

James takes me for a spin around the workshop. As we ride, I observe a few bike building details.  

The Raleigh road bike was sourced from a parts dealer but James has custom-fitted the components, including a Rohloff drag-refinement system and SRM brakes.  

When I stop, I ask James how the bikes are inspected for quality. He says they use"," James is building our first batch of frame components. I ask if this is his day job. ‘No, not at all.’ He explains that after a year out working with bikes he decided to try his hand at building his own. I am keen to get started so ask James to show me what he’s got going on. ‘This is a frame I’m building for a friend of mine who wants a second hand bike but doesn’t want to spend a fortune on it.’ So how did you learn to build bikes? ‘I found this old frame and realised the frame was in really good condition, just needed some paint. I stripped it down and was able to get it up and running really quickly.’ So you did learn from others’ experiences? ‘Not directly, but I did look online for a number of frames and put it together bit by bit. Once the basic mechanics of the build were in place I realised you can make this very accessible to anybody. And it’s a great way of getting kids to appreciate the importance of local sourcing, quality and environment.’ Do you know how many people you’ve trained so far? ‘I hope to train four people so far, the last batch were my son, his son and my brother and his son.’ You’re training four people? ‘Yes, four, because the course is for people who don’t have the skills to build a complete bike themselves. The course is done completely by hand, using"
" At the same time he and a few of his group members started running away. The strange male was left isolated, as the vervet group had realised the leopard had left them alone and now only included in its repertoire of sounds the ones associated with fleeing from leopards. It was only much later that the unusual presence of the stranger in the grove was noted by the dominant male and it came to light that he was in fact a chimpanzee.  

The moral of the story is that while it is not always necessary to be clever in order to be liked by your peers, sometimes using the language of apes can be an advantage. The lesson to be learnt here is that even though chimps may seem to be a lot less polite than vervet monkeys they have some very similar behavioural traits that can be advantageous in certain situations.

"," Even though the vervet leopard was a close relative the stranger knew was not going to attack. On the contrary it was a sign of the stranger’s inferiority that he had not been seen by the resident leopard in almost two years. The plan worked. The stranger was turned away and remained on the reserve for another five years before another group saw his signal and recruited him to their side.

Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe this story as “one of the most innovative leonine schemes ever devised”. They believe that this story provides a great deal of information about the behaviour and psychology of leopards. In particular they note that the leopard has to be able to recognise it’s potential victims, identify the vervet group as belonging to one of its own kind, and then it has to be able to overcome its natural suspicion of unfamiliar animals and join another group. By paying close attention to what Cheney and Seyfarth learned from fieldwork over the years they believe they are in a unique position to discuss their observations in the following essay.

The story of the stranger who joined the group of vervet monkeys is a story that vervet scientists often tell about the behaviour of leopards. However, whereas many scientists agree that there are a number of similarities between the two species, there are also quite significant differences. One of the most interesting similarities is that leopards are known to be particularly suspicious of unfamiliar individuals: they"," The stranger’s response would now be diverted from the group he claimed was his to try to chase after the leopard. And the leopard, knowing the dominant male was on the prowl for the stranger, would also be distracted from the vervets. Thus, it worked out just fine for everyone. The stranger was promptly chased away and the dominant male remained in control of his own domain. This incident demonstrates that although sometimes leopard and vervet monkey do interact when feeding, they generally do not interact much.  

This example from the wild, if true, indicates that one should not assume that any social interaction between vervets and leopards, whether friendly or antagonistic, will lead to an outcome as serious as that experienced by the vervet monkeys in the above scenario.  It would have been interesting to learn who was the stranger and why this particular male felt the need to get involved with the group and what his plans were as a member of the group. However, we do not know the details of this incident since this interaction between the two species probably did not lead to the familiar dominance/subordination relationship between the two species typical of interactions between them.


Vervet monkeys and leopards do interact when feeding, but this interaction between the two species is not generally violent.  It would be interesting to learn more about this incident between the two species and perhaps even find out the identity of the stranger and his motivations for getting involved","

It’s impossible to know for sure but it is entirely possible that the “stranger” in the story was actually a leopard. Even if the “stranger” was a leopard, however, the story remains an excellent example of how primates use signals to build social groups. The stranger first learned about the vervet monkey group from the group’s dominant male. He then modified his signal to fit in with the group and, finally, he started to hang around in another grove of trees (the grove from which the group would normally patrol), in order to observe the group without being discovered. The stranger was henceforth deterred from approaching the group and instead used his observations to attempt to usurp the dominant male from his position of power.

This story also serves as an excellent example of ape and human signalling. The stranger, in this story, first learned of the group’s location from the group’s dominant male. After he learned of this location he modified his signal to fit in with the group and he then started to hang around a neighbouring grove of trees, in order to observe the group without being discovered. In this way the group learned of the stranger’s presence from the group’s dominant male. It also demonstrates that apes can learn by watching other apes, a skill that is integral to survival in a group setting.

A final point that the story illustrates is the importance of context to interpreting animal"," There was a moment of disbelief for the stranger; he had not realised that leopards existed in the wild! It didn’t take long for him to leave the area and instead rejoin the group of monkeys from which he had come. He did not succeed in taking over the group, but he did get a taste of the leopard’s wrath: a ferocious encounter with a leopard was witnessed until the intruding male had fled. The vervet males were highly entertained by the strange affair that had taken place, and they resolved to investigate further, this time without the assistance of the alarm call.  

In the same way, many human societies have evolved means to discourage and/or remove individuals with the intention of keeping the group in tact. 

One of the most famous cases is that of the ""witch of Endor"". According to the legend, the Witch of Endor (in Israel) poisoned the wine that the King of the Philistines had mixed for his wine tasting. The king then wanted toasts to celebrate the victory of his archers over the Israelites, but the Witch of Endor begged him not to curse their friendship. The king and his courtiers drank the poisoned wine, and died, while the Philistines took the Arrow God, Goliath, as their trophy. 

Today’s human society is aware that one should not be afraid to criticize or to be different. 

Societies can prevent"," This worked a treat and for several days the stranger was kept well away from the group.


What an imaginative thought! The best way to keep a foreign male away is to call out loud everytime you spot a potential threat nearby! But wait, there’s more. The story is neatly tied together with the vervet equivalent of a stroke of genius: the hit on the ideal ploy to keep the stranger away from his group. This phrase is actually a “quotation” from the English language educationist H.W. Flesch who coined the word Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale. The scale was developed in the 1970s and measured the readability of written material; a high grade score was interpreted as the text being easy to comprehend for a 5th grade student.


What a clever story! The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale is now considered a poor measurement of the readability of text, as the measurement is skewed towards assessing the words, sentences and syllables in a text, rather than the number of words in an article. However, if we can use this story as a starting point it does give an example of how a narrative can be crafted to address a specific education need. Firstly, the narrative uses a quote from an expert in the field in order to give authority to the content and, secondly, the narrative shows a clever idea that, if followed, could keep the reader engaged. While it's true that"," The leopard in question was an old, wounded and embittered leopard that had moved to the grove of trees to live off the monkey meat there. He was also not pleased at the state of affairs in which he found himself. He was far from satisfied with his current location and knew that soon his time would come to die. The new arrival had arrived just at the right time to cause a stir. While the vervets waited for the leopard to reappear to them, the stranger made his move. He attempted to make his way towards the grove of trees and to the detriment of both the vervets and their food source.  

The stranger quickly realised that the vervets were not going to help him join his group, and so he decided to do what any good leopard would do: he eliminated his competition. He leapt upon the nearest male and proceeded to have his way with the unfortunate leopard. The scene was chaotic and the stranger had an easy time with the vervets. The leopard had not foreseen the arrival of the stranger and was caught completely unawares by this new arrival. The stranger had anticipated that there would be a leopard in the vicinity, so it did not take long for him to finish his meal. The stranger had been well prepared by the leopard for his meal and it made for a tasty dinner. This was not the first time that the strange male had been present in the area,"
" In conclusion a theory of art is not possible for the same reason that theory about the atom cannot exist since both are products. 

In the first section of the article, Orwell considers the problem of writing an essay about aesthetics without referring to any existing works of art. In response to this problem, he argues that any existing works of art are not necessary in order to write about aesthetics, and that any conventions surrounding the topic are in his view beneficial for stimulating original thought. In the second section, Orwell describes his experiences with an airplane, which, while not being a work of art, nevertheless inspired him to write a much-needed essay about aesthetics.


It is important to note that Orwell's views on this topic were formed in the context of the first world war, in which case the idea that any conventions surrounding the subject of aesthetics might actually be inhibiting was not as absurd as it is today. It also seems unlikely that Orwell experienced an airplane in his youth such that his thoughts on this topic were fully formed, as his experience of an airplane could have merely inspired his essay through associative reasoning. Still, his thoughts on this topic did provide an impetus for him to publish the essay ""Politics and the English Language.""


It is also important to note that, despite his reservations, Orwell's essay remains one of the most influential on the subject of aesthetics. His central thesis—that conventional assumptions surrounding the subject of aesthetics are in his view beneficial for stimulating"," And finally with modern techniques now commonly available to those who have skill in applying them, the actual work of art can easily become a mere object whose very perfection blocks rather than fosters understanding.

As you have learned in Art History Class, the human ability to generate artistic expression is part of the cultural heritage of humankind. Art historian and critic Michel Foucault wrote extensively about the relationship between the object and its user in The Order of Things. In that book he argues that the relationship between art object and user is different from common conception.

Through the medium of lectures and discussions, students will begin to consider how art historical discourse has come to be limited in its scope by the material qualities of the art objects it analyzes, and begin to ask: how would a different analysis of artworks lead to different and possibly better insights into the human experience of art?

The following passage is an excerpt from Michel Foucault’s text, The Order of Things, written in 1973.  In it, Foucault argues that the material object has been stripped of its capacity for human meaning, a phenomenon he calls “aesthetics of things”.  In contrast to common notions of the relationship between objects and users, the relationship between the object and its user is not an efficient relationship, nor is it one of cause and effect.  It is, in fact, a disparate and complex web of powers, forms and functions.  What this passage is primarily","  

The above quote is from Georg Simmel, one of the fathers of sociology and a modern thinker about art.
Art and experience, like all creative pursuits, does not happen in a vacuum, and while it is important to keep in mind the context in which art occurs, the importance of context must be understated for the sake of understanding. 

Simmel's quote art is a product that exists physically.  Modern society has evolved to the point where most of the art we see and experience today is not created solely in the physical world but is often a virtual representation of an idea or concept that has developed beyond the physical world and into a virtual one.  We are now able to consume content in a wide variety of ways including listening to music, reading a book, watching a video and creating virtual worlds.   

These virtual worlds are not the physical creation of another person, company or government.  The content within the virtual world is not coming from a physical location.  It is not even created by a team of people.  It is an idea that has developed into a virtual world via technology and computer networking.  It has grown from a concept into a world that people can inhabit and express themselves in in a unique way.  This ability to create content and experiences in virtual worlds gives us the opportunity to be a participant in a world that has a different spatial composition than the physical world around us.  The concept of spatial composition is defined"," For example in western tradition beauty is associated with proportion and harmony between parts. The classic Greek and Roman works of art in this tradition possessed a symmetry of parts that created the sensation of beauty. However since the 19th century the discovery of the pyramidal shapes of a camel's hump and other less aesthetic parts of animals have led to the development of what is now called Artistic Form and it follows that the beauty in the work of art is in the form, not in the parts. But in any event the very existence of works of art implies a separation of subject and object, artist and work, for they come into being only through the human act of creation and that is in essence subject to theory not object. They then act as barriers to theory because they imply separation that is essential to aesthetic experience. Hence in addition to the other difficulties in theory of aesthetics they have now developed an extra problem which is that of a work of art. 

The author of this essay does not pretend to have all the answers to the difficulties that beset theory of aesthetics. 

The Flesch Kincaid Grade scale is a scale used to measure the readability of text.


# Aesthetics


The existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them.


## In common conception the work of art is often identified with the building book painting or statue in its existence apart from human experience.


Since the"," 
However the works of art are not a collection of stone and metal, they are human creations which at their core also are the product of experience. If we approach the process of creation, we also approach the work product. The creation is not something separate from the product, it is one of its aspects. And so theory about art is inseparable from the experience of creating it. Theory about it is like a lighthouse in the sea of experience, guiding us to the rock of art. 
If we look at the theory that exists about art we notice three main areas. First theory about the nature of art. A painting is art and is an objective creation of elements arranged in such a way that the eye perceives the image of a human face or an object. This is considered a general feature of art which is generally attributed to the work of Aristotle.
Second theory about purpose and intention in creating. Theory on intention goes back to the times of the Greeks. One theory says that intention creates an artwork for a reason, it is deliberate. This has inspired much research on the subject and the results have guided artistic practice in Europe since the Renaissance and beyond. In modern times intention has been applied in fields such as advertising, marketing and corporate communications and has been shown to influence human behaviour. 
Third theory about perception. This aspect of art has had the most development. There is a theory that states that perception is created by the act of perception, the process of being","

The works of art examined here are also not part of a long and unquestioned history of admiration. They have each been produced in a particular time and place, within a particular historical and philosophical context and they were produced in response to specific cultural, social and political needs.

There is so much to admire in American Visions. Hughes travels around the United States visiting galleries, studios and museums, giving us a unique perspective on the development of American art, which is characterised by artists such as Robert Indiana, Donald Judd and Ellsworth Kelly. The programme is shot with authority and precision, with Hughes’s voiceover providing expert commentary throughout.


However what is so disappointing is that Hughes cannot make the American vision clear. What is difficult to follow, even for those with some background in art, is the mixture of influences and styles on display. It is confusing and this feeling of unease is compounded by Hughes’s sometimes sluggish filming style. Hughes uses wide shots and panning shots to capture the variety of artworks on display but these can slow the programme down. The programme looks good and contains striking images but it is difficult to look away and it is this tension between aesthetic pleasure and the desire to understand what is happening which makes for a frustrating viewing experience. 

The technical qualities of the programme cannot conceal the fact that it is a flawed documentary. Hughes is unable to make the American vision clear. What is difficult to follow, even for those with some background in art, is the mixture of influences and styles on display. It is confusing and this feeling of unease is compounded by Hughes’s sometimes sluggish filming style.


The opening episode is a good way to get viewers interested in what American Visions"," The result is that in a series that is intended to last eight years, only three or four were even considered, with viewers being given little sense of the enormous historical significance of the issues covered. The fact that this is a British series was clearly less of a problem as the issues raised were often about European modern art which most British viewers would have little exposure to. What was interesting was that Hughes’s approach was not entirely a negative one. He opened with the comment that “I don’t know who I am doing this for, really”. What he was doing was recognising that there was interest and demand for this kind of coverage and that his goal as a critic was to answer the questions: “why is this important and why is it important now?”. By treating his subject with respect and presenting the issues honestly, he has clearly struck a chord with viewers who have responded with enthusiasm. However this is no easy task when you are confronted with issues of power, money and culture as well as artistic taste, making this a very hard subject to cover in twenty four hours.

The Americans were the best of the many series that Robert Hughes produced. It covered art history from the Pre-Raphaelites to the present day and concentrated on the major American galleries and museums and their founders. Hughes spent considerable time studying the archives and visited the galleries extensively. The result was a programme that was both fascinating and educational.

The Americans has been shown by some, mainly American,"," The BBC can learn from the success of this programme. 

In the programme, Hughes travels across the United States, visiting galleries and museums and interviewing established artists such as Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Chuck Close and Richard Serra. Hughes is, of course, well qualified to make such an assessment of American art. He has held prestigious positions at The New York Times and Sackler Faculty of Arts at Oxford University, and studied and taught at Harvard University and Princeton University. This combination of experience and access, allied to the prestige of the art institutions he visits, enables him to make authoritative judgements about the state of American art. 

So what is wrong with television programmes about the visual arts? What Hughes fails to do in American Visions is provide a critical context for his judgements. He is given no background to show that American art is a small and insignificant part of a much larger history and culture. He is not given the chance to examine how certain artists have reinterpreted the role of the artist in society and how this has had a profound effect on their artistic development. Hughes is therefore forced to rely on superficial comparisons between American art and art created in Europe and Asia to make his case, which is a very dangerous thing to do when making assertions about the significance of art of another culture. 

American Visions is a well intentioned but ultimately misguided attempt to educate British viewers about an important part of American culture. There are parallels here with"," The programme starts with a scene of the American East Coast with some of the leading proponents in the show who includes Jules Engle, Walter De Maria and Claes Oldenburg. Hughes gets rolling by interviewing De Maria about the work he is involved with at the moment and how it is based on the artist’s experiences of working on trains. What should have been a fascinating conversation about a major exhibition in New York but turns into a series of clips from the exhibition, with the sound of trains running down the tunnel below. Engle has a similar experience working on a train on an earlier occasion. The same scene then revisited with Oldenburg’s work, his work is shown in the flesh for the first time, and this time there is no sound of trains. It is here where the narrative abruptly switches to focus on the work that Oldenburg is involved with at the moment. Hughes now has to get up to speed to explain the difference between his work and Oldenburg’s, despite the fact that Oldenburg has several galleries and shows of his work, Oldenburg doesn’t sell his work, he trades it. Hughes has now learned about the art world and art theory he needs to continue the interview, but the art world’s most famous artist is not interested in discussing his work. Instead Hughes is able to conduct a testy interview with De Maria on his relationship with the art world, the influence of the art world, how it feels to be treated unfairly by"," He has also chosen to show his chosen works in some detail on screen to give an authentic view of his choices. The series starts well and is well paced showing the artists’ work. However the lack of continuity at the beginning of the series (showcasing the artists in the order in which they died) means that viewers are not quite sure whether they are seeing work by the pioneers or more recent works and as a result find themselves tuning out after the first hour or so. Hughes returns to the American theme for the final episode, which is certainly more engaging, but his decision to have the majority of his chosen artists in the final episode live has meant that there is not enough time to develop their work. Hughes could have spent more time choosing artists, for example Robert Indiana only had one work in the series and Hughes could have focussed his choice on his best known and most successful work which is certainly more engaging and different to the standard TV biography. Hughes is an experienced and acclaimed television critic with this series he could have brought his knowledge to bear to make this an engaging series for viewers. The series does have an ending, but at only 32 minutes it is too short. The final sequence does show an interpretation of some of the artists’ work, but it was a shame that Hughes did not spend more time on this. In summary, I would rate the programme as 3/10, with one notable exception which could have been an 8/10. What do you think? What"," 
The first episode opens in 1957. This is the year of the Venice Biennale and the De Kooning exhibition. In De Kooning viewers get a rare view of a self-taught American artist whose bold abstract work caused a sensation and made him an instant star. In the first episode we see this artist explaining his work to an amazed Robert Hughes. The conversation is filmed from above and so we get a great view of De Kooning’s distinctive style. De Kooning explains how his work was almost destroyed when it was exhibited in the 1940s at the ‘Wadsworth Atheneum’ which resulted in him moving to New York where his work was championed by the art scene that existed then. He also describes his use of pure white paint and the method of applying it which is described as having been inspired by the way chickens apply dust before showing. He is also wearing white clothing which makes him stand out from the crowd of other artists in the room. 
De Kooning has just described a great American art scene that existed in the 1950s. American Visions takes the viewer on a journey back to 1957. It is a fascinating insight into a time when both artists and art critics were open to challenging and different. The second episode then returns to 1957 where we meet a group of mid century modernists including Robert Morris, Philip Johnson and Cady Noland. All four are dressed in a mix of bold patterns and bright colours and"," As a viewer, I enjoyed the story and the art history lessons but the artworks were often distracting to the narrative, and at times distracting from it. The American art museums that Hughes visited frequently also tended to be flashy, gaudy and sometimes even inappropriate. Hughes spends quite a lot of time at the Fiskville Gallery in Harlem, NY - an exhibition space that he co-founded with James Johnson. I do not claim to have been to Fiskville, but the museum and exhibition must have a space feel to it as the colour schemes, artworks and design are all strikingly similar to one another. Some of the artwork was lovely - for example, a painting of a black labrador sitting on a white sofa with a book on the sofa and a black spotlight shining down on the dog’s head and coat, and so moving. Some of the art was less so - a group of huge, white cubes on a black background and the statement “artists only sell artwork, they don’t paint or sculpt” was absurd in its arrogance, while some of the work looked more like the contents of a large warehouse than an exhibition space. The show had a very high ceiling, and although I don’t know the original function of the ceiling, one assumes that it would have offered an opportunity for installation art - which the museum’s lack of interest in such things clearly indicates. The narrative was a good one - Hughes follows a series"
" If you are not up to the mark you become a stereotype and quickly boring.’ We should pay heed to these words of wisdom from an actor and endeavour to perform our art with vigour, humility and courage. I know there are some excellent and talented young actors currently working in our profession and they are all worth cheering for. Let us celebrate them and support them with our votes. It’s the actors who make the plays, the actors who entertain the audiences. Let us give our utmost support to them.

Paul Scofield is a distinguished actor and theatre director whose career was cut tragically short by the sudden and unexpected death of his wife just before her 58th birthday. To commemorate her he put on his street suit and went to work. The letter was written while he was putting on his street suit. For Paul Scofield acting was about the job of being an actor which was only possible in his imagination. ‘Making it’ was only possible when he gave up trying to control the art which was in his bones because for Scofield the creative process was a chaotic maelstrom and he was constantly pulled in different directions by the demands of making a living and providing for his family. Scofield was the last surviving member of the original Theatre Royal Drury Lane company which he founded in 1947 and the Drury Lane that he brought to life with his company on the London stage has given birth to many fine generations of theatre-goers. The original Drury Lane company featured the greats of the era: Charles Laughton, Margaret Leighton, Peter O’Toole, Paul Scofield and Glenda Jackson among many others.  

There will never be another Paul Scofield, but the words of his friend were a lesson to us"," The actor who can sustain an interest over an entire performance, who can hold the audience’s interest and is not an obvious success, is almost always the actor who is least concerned with his or her own success or lack of it. I find this very exciting.’ And a wise one too. 

And thus is born the Actors’ Craft.


The following passage is taken from the lecture series for A2 learners entitled ‘Knowledge is Power, Learn the Actor’s Craft’.  The A2 learners in this course have various attributes that allow them to be at the cutting edge of their own personal development and are able to understand the nuances and subtleties in what the lecturer is trying to convey through this example.  This passage is a summation of the course material with minor edits.  Most importantly it is aimed at the learner who is interested in the Actor's Craft but might not be at the same level as this A2 learner who has successfully completed this course.  


‘Knowledge is Power, Learn the Actor's Craft’ is a unique course at the Conservatory with modules taught by industry professionals.  Courses are taught twice a month and every module builds on the previous one, increasing in complexity and relevance.  Every module starts with a lecture, designed to give a general overview of the topic of the module and to introduce you to the concept of knowledge management.  Each module concludes with a workshop, where you’re"," Execution is what the audience perceives and experiences.’ He was talking about Shakespeare but the sentiment applies to most actors.

I think there’s a grain of truth in what the man said too: there is no ‘I’ in team unless you’re a c*nt (if you’re a c*nt: you should be ashamed of yourself for being one; we all struggle with self-care and you are no less guilty than me of falling into ‘ponderous clichés silly truisms’). And yet, acting is teamwork and I doubt there is any actor or actress, professional or amateur, who doesn’t also enjoy the rewards of an audience’s laughter or tears or silence (or all three!) at the end of their performance. And I suspect that there is a grain of truth in the man’s observation too, to the extent that whether a performance is ‘life and interest only in its execution’ depends almost entirely on the ‘perception and experience’ that the audience has of it.

And this leads us to the next grain of truth: we often judge a performance not by what it is but by what we wish it to be, or wish it to be for us. And the truth of this may be the ultimate cause of the third grain of truth which I suspect is also in the man’s letter: that performance in its essence is a form of communication between an audience and an actor. When we"," And that execution is what you learn by doing it, by doing it until you can no longer do it.’

What is the essence of this passage from Pavlova? Let us ponder: ‘I wouldn’t dance it’. What does she mean? She’s saying that dancing the part she was assigned would be a waste of her skill. Does she mean dancing the particular dance sequence she was told to perform or simply the entire piece? In the second interpretation, Pavlova is saying that she would rather not dance at all than dance a badly executed dance. How does this relate to what the man asked her? It seems Pavlova is telling us that the man asked her a stupid question and that she would rather not answer it than give an ill-informed and uneducated answer. What else can she say in response to this question? I suppose ‘I couldn’t dance it’ could be a valid answer but Pavlova is being rather evasive here. Perhaps she could have said: ‘I wouldn’t want to dance that because that is not a dance’. But then again, perhaps not. What is interesting to note here is Pavlova’s use of the verb ‘dance’: she’s not saying that she would not dance the part but rather that she would not dance it, i.e., she wouldn’t want to dance it. By this she makes it quite clear that she has been asked to perform a dance and"," You cannot save an actor by saying nice things about him/her. I want people to remember our performances at our performances, not at our parties.’ The Actor’s Craft deserves better.

"," To become an artist one must first forget one’s own art and become inseparable from the art of another.’ A performer who is obsessed with their craft and their art becomes indecisive and directionless, just as actors who become obsessed with their art become inattentive to their craft, and the result is a car crash of a performance where the art runs amok and the craft just tries to save its skin. The actor’s craft can only flourish through an artful attention to both the craft and the art, and the two cannot survive without the other. In fact, if we take Scofield’s advice to heart, an actor who sacrifices the art for the sake of the craft can only produce mediocre performances which are all too often, boring and lifeless.

The text assesses Actor’s Craft Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova’s reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: ‘If I could tell you’ she said ‘I wouldn’t dance it.’ But instead they all too easily fall into ponderous clichés silly truisms or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine. We should all pay heed to what Paul Scof"
" If you don’t answer it yourself it’s time to take a long hard look at what your workplace is doing to you and ask whether it’s time to exit the employment ecosystem altogether. The answer will be yes. Because your business model is destroying your mental health. 

A:

The answer to this might depend on what exactly you mean by ""deserve"". But there are several things you could do to make sure you are valued:

Ensure you are being properly compensated. This does not mean paying yourself enough to live on, but at least a middle-class living wage.
Be part of an organization that encourages professional development and recognizes your contributions. 

Another way of looking at this would be to consider your overall worth as a person - does your work contribute to that worth? If so, ensure you are not compromising that worth by doing it grudgingly or at the behest of someone else who is more powerful or has a larger stake in the matter.
In summary, ""deserve"" should not be considered in isolation from your overall value to yourself and your employer.

"," If you don’t ask yourself these questions you won’t know if your work is ruining you. If it isn’t and you don’t act to change it you will end up resenting it and looking for alternative sources of fulfilment, satisfaction and meaning. If you do ask yourself these questions and you realise the job isn’t quite what you expected and you don’t like some of the people with whom you have to interact then you will know whom to hold directly responsible for your unhappiness and find a way to look at your job in a new light that makes you more comfortable. 
Respect for Yourself and Respect for Others We need to treat ourselves with respect. Respect for our bodies, our needs and our limits. If we ignore them we risk making ourselves vulnerable to injury or illness. Respect for the needs and limits of others. Respect for our own creativity. Some of the most successful people know how to take control. They don’t wait for life to throw them obstacles to knock them off course, they set goals, they take initiative. But if we’re always waiting for the clock to remind us to do something, we stop creating. And if we’re always resenting the constraints of our situation, we’re not happy. How We Can Improve Your Working Life Are you being treated with respect? Are you giving yourself time to heal and recover after a difficult day at work? Do you recognise the importance"," Most people will never ask themselves this important question. For this reason, the book offers advice to those who are struggling with job burn out, but the most important advice applies to all people: look around you. You too are affected by what your job is doing to you and you need to work harder at self awareness. In a post-fame world that values everyone’s opinions and self awareness, the only people who are not seeking self awareness are the those who are not in a career that they love and is respected.

Zeldin then goes on to give six tips for finding work you love.  1) Do what you love and spend all your time on it. 2) Respect your time. Do not fill your time with work that does not matter. 3) Set small goals. 4) Spend time with people who appreciate your work. 5) Ask for more help. 6) Create social media content that highlights the work you love.  Zeldin ends the narrative with a quote from Coco Chanel:  “We will never have more beautiful clothes if we do not stop waiting for the inspiration to come to us and wear ourselves out chasing it.”

This narrative does not explain the principles of value in the work place nor does it provide sample questions for asking yourself this important question.  However, it does offer advice that is easy to implement and could be very valuable to many individuals who find themselves struggling with job burn out or seeking advice"," If you are not fulfilled and not truly valued, you are likely to leave your job, which will mean more job losses as other organizations lose your expertise and your motivation to produce.

These are some of the challenges that the 21st century’s workers face:

1. We are increasingly expected to do more with less, which means working harder and longer.
2. The pace of change means that new skills and knowledge are needed every year, so workers have to be willing to change careers more often.
3. Firms are increasingly eager to hire ""millennial"" talent—that is, people who have entered the workforce in the past decade. But this generation has grown up with an abundance of choices, so it is hard for workers in this era to know what they are passionate about and what they should do.

In short, many workers in the 21st century struggle to find satisfaction in their careers, so they may become burnt out and leave their jobs. That would be a shame because our economy and society would lose valuable insights and resources. So how can workers increase their value in their careers?

Zeldin's answer is to “appreciate and respect” your career. First of all, appreciate the satisfaction of knowing that you are contributing to something that is important to people. Next, respect the fact that every career is not for you. Ask yourself what else you could be doing that is more aligned with your innate curiosity or propensity for"," If you believe your job is harming you personally you should be looking for alternative sources of income or look at ways of finding meaningful work that will make you happy without needing you to be a slave to an employer. As it is we often find ourselves either in a state of resigned apathy or even worse we find ourselves working in what seems to be an endless struggle to simply stay afloat. Our working lives could be easier, more enjoyable, fulfilling and our finances more secure. Could it be that the problem is not with the economy but rather with how we view our jobs? We need to stop looking at them as necessary evils and start to see them as means to ends that could improve our lives. The economy will always require workers for certain jobs. But if we re-think what those jobs should be for we could see that the work we do is often harmful to our physical and mental health and could also be draining and leave little time for what really matters. Do we really need people to make iPhones, drive self-driving cars or build nuclear weapons? There are some jobs, as Theodore Zeldin argues, that really are just to make us suffer in our lives. Think of all the pain we could all do away with if all doctors and lawyers simply stopped. And think of the money we could save on prison fees, benefits and other social services. We could cut crime by about 95% and still be millions of dollars ahead. And by focusing on what we are"," When we work at harming ourselves at work, we are harming not only ourselves but our colleagues, customers and the general mission of the enterprise.  

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is a measure of how easy it is to read text.  The higher the score the easier it is to read.  Text that has a Flesch-Kincaid Grade score of 100 is considered to be easy to read. Text with a Flesch-Kincaid Grade score of 85 and below is considered to be moderately easy to read. Text with a Flesch-Kincaid Grade score of 60 and below is considered to be difficult to read.  The above text has a Flesch-Kincaid Grade score of 82.  

This narrative is difficult to read because the number of words, sentences, and syllables are all close.  The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale considers a word to have 5 syllables if the word is the root of a word of 4 syllables.  This narrative contains a total of 14 words, 39 sentences, and 114 syllables.  This makes the text difficult to read.  The text has more words than sentences and sentences than syllables.  This makes it difficult to understand what the text is trying to say.  Overall, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale considers the text to be moderately difficult to read.

This text is about success and value, about how our working life should be valued and how we should love our work. This text has clear information points and is understandable for a learner of A2 level.

* Respected and appreciated: this sentence starts by addressing the topic of respect and appreciation from a wide variety of professions and people, and mentions that even among individuals who have won eminence there is often bitterness behind the fame. This makes it seem like the work we do is important and worthwhile, and should be valued.

* Have enough: this sentence explains that we used to think that having enough money and success in life was enough. Now that is not enough, and we now need to ask ourselves what our work is doing to us to our mind, character, and relationships. This makes it clear that your work is not satisfying or fulfilling to you, and you should get out of it.

" It is instinctual. What makes it interesting is the fact that we have the extraordinary ability to control our language to achieve great precision. We can talk about things and events that are actually not in any way related to the subject that we are discussing. I love this aspect of language as it allows one to use it to discover even the most unexpected and hidden connections. One example to keep in mind while reading this paragraph is that two people may enjoy discussing the merits and demerits of a certain animal species. In this way a seemingly pointless and purely academic discussion can lead to a connection between a person and an animal that both enjoy. I encourage you to use language to uncover new connections between things and events. 
One of the best ways to master language is by talking to native speakers. Learning foreign language requires spending a lot of time in a dictionary to understand the pronunciation of unknown words and their derivation. When learning a foreign language you can take advantage of the following three strategies to be able to talk with native speakers effortlessly. 
First, get to know someone who already speaks the foreign language. This allows you to read books and watch films made by this person. It also allows you to talk to him/her and thus learn the pronunciation of unknown words.
Second, take a class. Such classes can be offered online or in a bricks and mortar place. Taking a class requires paying attention to instructor who is explaining the pronunciation of unknown words and their derivation. This"," In the beginning people just learned the rudiments of speech. They formed sounds with the soft palate and jaw, and the air moved in and out of their mouths like a fan. But once they learned how to pronounce words they were off and running. They started to use the principles of grammar and sentence structure to express themselves in ever more creative and entertaining ways.

You might be a little child just starting to talk, and you find it difficult to put together sentences. Some children are born with a natural instinct for language. It is called ‘ Language Delay ’. Most children who are Language Delayed are not fully able to talk until around age 7. After that, it is often possible to improve their speech with practice. At school you will be taught the basics of the English language which will help you build on your skills. Good luck!

"," Like the intricacy of a spiderweb, the complexity of human language defies easy explanation.  Language is the glue that brings people from different places and times together.  Language allows you to ask questions and express your thoughts to the world. You and I can communicate with ease and efficiency without the need for words.  But  we would not be what we are if we could not exchange thoughts and ideas through the art of language. Without the skill of language we would be little more than animals. In the past people with disabilities have always been stigmatized and discriminated against.  This is still the case today in many parts of the world. In some countries a person with a disability is deemed not to have the ‘right’ to live. This idea is simply wrong. It is time we promote the right of people with disabilities to be involved in shaping their own destiny.  In the not too distant past it was thought that language was only for humans. But scientists have now identified that there is a distinct language capacity in non human animals as well. For example, great apes have recently been shown to possess the ability to communicate using complex sentences and phrases.  This is remarkable because great apes do not have language centers in their brains similar to humans. Language is innate in most non human animals.  We are at the forefront of a revolution that has taken place in our evolutionary past. We have come to realize that language is not reserved for humans.  There are no guarantees"," Language is also remarkable for its power to convey meaning with clarity and precision. It is often said that any language spoken by people is turing into English is just as precise as any other. One interesting feature of language is that while it can be used to refer to a person or persons it can also refer to a thing as well. For example a word like “chair” can refer to a person’s chair or a rock which the chair resembles. In the first case the chair is the referent, the referent for “chair” is the person. In the second case the chair is the referent, the chair is the referent. Another interesting feature of language is that it can convey ideas in a more or less precise manner depending on how frequently it is used in conveying those ideas. For example a popular expression “Harmless as a Frog” is easy to remember and convey with clarity because it is used often and in an elliptical fashion. Frog is the referent and Harmless is the quality the frog exhibits. However, an expression that conveys the same idea or meaning in more exact terms such as “Harmless as in ‘Harmless as a Frog’ would be more difficult to remember or convey.

Language also allows humans to exchange ideas in a non verbal fashion. It is often stated that a spoken conversation can convey more meaning and precision than a written one. In many ways this is true. A conversation can convey more meaning in"," While some human communities might never have seen a spoken word transmitted via language our community has done so for a very long time. The first evidence for language transmission dates back more than a hundred thousand years to a time when modern Homo sapiens emerged from their African roots. But we didn’t need language to survive for very long. The ability to talk was an invaluable asset which allowed our ancestors to forage for food, avoid dangerous situations and find partners to procreate with. Over the course of the last million years language use has developed further and further.

Over the course of the last million years language use has developed further and further. 

It is likely that humans have been speaking continuously since the first stone tools were made around 300,000 years ago. We make extensive use of language in our daily lives but we also use it to communicate with each other, negotiate a contract, hire an armed guard, or to send a message around the world. 

The most recent common ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals shared approximately 95% of its DNA. This is an incredible success and shows how very closely related we"," This ability to talk to oneself to a pet or plant, but not necessarily to another human, is called “self-monitoring” in the linguistic literature. In English, the term commonly used is “self-correction”. When the language we speak does not meet our intended meaning, it is often because the speaker was thinking about something else and consequently forgot to say something to make that intended meaning clear. This phenomenon of “looking away from one's text” and “forgetting” to say something is called an “oe’emesis” in the linguistic literature. To paraphrase the Latin maxim “Qui nescis diligenter studetur nihil”. In other words, “Who carefully studies doesn't understand everything” refers to the phenomenon of not saying something one intends to say in one’s text. In short, we all make mistakes and often do not intend to say something that we later regret or that fails to make its intended meaning clear to the intended recipient. In our case, we are not perfect at thinking of everyone we want to talk to and, therefore, have “oe’ematics” when we do not say something that we intend to say. In summary, “oe’ematics” or “looking away from one's text” is a common phenomenon and in general doesn’t mean that something bad has actually happened. To illustrate: think of a conversation you have had with your spouse or a close friend who unfortunately you caught saying something"," This is because language is so closely woven into human experience that there is not much difference between the ability to use language and the ability to speak. A child will start using language around three years of age and gradually master it through adolescence and adulthood.  

Language You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarce possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth they will soon be exchanging words. When there is no one to talk with people talk to themselves to their dogs even to their plants. I like to describe the skill of language as an ‘instinct’. This conveys the idea that people know how to talk in more or less the sense that spiders know how to spin webs. 

This is because language is so closely woven into human experience that there is not much difference between the ability to use language and the ability to speak. A child will start using language around three years of age and gradually master it through adolescence and adulthood.

Born in the years after the First World War, kinetic art emerged out of the German expressionist Bauhaus movement as an alternative form of art which questioned both the usefulness and aesthetic worth of traditional representation. This new vision of art as a form of self-contained movement – a movement imbued with meaning, poetry and beauty – went largely unappreciated outside its German heartland and took more than half a century to take hold in Europe. 

Fast forward to the 1960s: Andy Warhol is transforming the art world with his artworks, which are both comprised of and animate Campbell’s soup cans. Coil, Fluxus and kinetic art re-emerge as more popular themes in the 1970s with artists such as Yoko Ono, John Cage and Richard Long. During this time, some of the most influential art institutions, including Tate Modern and Tate Britain, are building their collections around kinetic art. 

And now we have Kinetic Art Rejoice, an exhibition which brings together artists from the 1960s and 70s who have employed kinetic art to question the nature of the visual, to explore the relationship between art and everyday life. The British contribution is led by Mark Wallinger, who has explored the idea of movement in such films as A Single Man and The Singing Neanderthal. Here Wallinger explores movement within a film strip of the Neanderthal family, made using stop-motion animation, and their interaction with","

The exhibition begins with a powerful exploration of ‘Body Art’, an expression coined by the British art critic Mel Bochner in 1956. This art featured images produced through various forms of body modification or artificial limbs, most famously the work of the Italian artist Fabio Zampini. But it was a British contingent which pioneered the field. Surrealist artist Max Ernst made kinetic works such as his 1967 ‘Abriss de la chair’, while the Welsh Surrealist John Wynford Jones produced scores of ‘kinetic’ images and assemblages during the 1960s and 70s. His 1970 work, for instance, combined cut-up pieces of newspapers, magazines and ephemera with photographs of everyday objects – a remarkable example of combining the power of media and everyday materials to create something completely new. But Jones was far from alone. As the exhibition goes on to reveal, other British artists of the 1960s and 70s produced works which directly incorporated movement into their imagery, or drew inspiration from kinetic forms and ideas.

A striking example is John Paul Nash’s installation ‘Moving Sculpture: The Creation of a Work for Rotary Moving Platform’. Commissioned by the British Academy in 1967, this work, constructed out of over a tonne of metal, included a large number of highly articulated human figures which could be adjusted through the use of cables and pulleys. The work, which remains on display at Tate Modern’s new Hayward Gallery today, is","

Of course, the modernist avant-garde led by De Stijl and Bauhaus would have you believe that movement is something that should be shunned by artists, even when movement is integral to the artistic challenge. The De Stijl Manifesto was founded in the latter half of the Twenties and became an almost religious belief system; not least because its principles, with their obsession with geometrical forms, were initially used as the basis for WWII fighter planes. To De Stijl movement was therefore strictly verboten – it would never occur in an artwork – and this attitude has continued to influence subsequent movements.

The belief that movement was not only anti-Art, but anathema, continues to this day. One need look no further than Andy Warhol’s screen prints of Elvis Presley’s face (with its famously inane line of movement) or Salvador Dali’s wings or Campbell’s soup cans to see movement not valued. 

But while modernism is famous for repudiating movement, it was not the first to embrace it. Nor were many avant-garde movements totally against it. There were a number of precursors to the modernist embrace of movement – the Bauhaus, and De Stijl, come readily to mind – but it was the post-war Abstract Expressionists who brought movement to the fore as an artistic issue.

And it’s this aspect of abstract expressionism","

Some notable artists include Nam June Paik, Walter de Maria, and Antoni Acula. Together they have created a number of intriguing installations and dynamic sculptures that either utilise the idea of movement in some way or make use of machines and motors, often combined with rope or pulleys. Paik’s “Bulletin Board” for example consists of a scrolling text panel over which a series of mirrors reflect a light beam. The mirror reflection is periodically diverted by the panel’s horizontal scrolling, and the effect is one of intense movement and almost dance-like energy. Paik was famous for his “Ceramic Cut-Up” works, which used specially shaped ceramic tiles and a machine called a CNC to carve them up and recombine them in new and sometimes quite spectacular ways, all achieved without the use of glue or other adhesives, and even in some cases by melting the pieces together.

Born in Vienna in 1936, Egon Schiele (1890 – 1918) was an icon of early twentieth-century European modernism. For the next three years he studied art in Vienna, and in 1917 – following his friend and fellow painter Oskar Kokoschka’s lead – he moved to Germany to study mural and figure painting with the painter Emil Wurm at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts. The following year Schiele was sent to London by Wurm with a view to finding a more commercially promising career path. In London, Schiele found like-minded friends and supporters in the vibrant creative circle around Gertude Stein, George Grosz and Picasso, whose artworks and radical politics he closely aligned himself with.

With war looming, Schiele returned to Vienna in 1918. After the dissolution of the Düsseldorf Academy following World War I, he found himself without a formal art education. This forced him to turn to his artistic talent and considerable aptitude for problem-solving, a talent which he had already honed at an early age while caring for his parents as a boy. A lifelong pattern of addiction to cocaine and other sedatives began and Schiele would go on to commit suicide at the age of 47.

Schiele began his artistic career by producing a series of engravings of female nudes, which drew negative reviews from the Austrian art establishment"," 

The exhibition features paintings, videos, drawings and an extensive archive of press cuttings documenting the emergence of kinetic art during the 1970s and 80s. It makes clear that the roots of this form of expression go back to the late 19th century and stretch as far back as prehistoric cave paintings of animal figures chasing one another. 

Moving on from the idea that the primary purpose of art is to communicate something beyond itself to the audience, the 1960s saw a more experimental exploration of the idea that artworks could themselves express movement. A particular inspiration for these artists was the work of physicist Emanuel Feireisein, and his 1961 book Art and Physics explored some of the ideas which were beginning to emerge around the idea of a reciprocal relationship between art and physics. The exhibition also explores the more radical ideas being advanced in the 1960s by Italian mathematician and art theorist Umberto Eco – ideas which were soon followed up by similar ideas coming out of the British art world.

Somewhat more mainstream was a 1970s movement which embraced a kind of ‘hard science’ approach to art. This began with the groundbreaking work of physicist Freeman J. Dyson, who in 1970 published his article ‘A New Window on Physics’, in which he laid out ideas for a system of ‘dynamic' universes which would enable the development of new visual forms using light. This idea would ultimately inspire a generation of artists in the UK to take up what became known as","  

This was certainly the view expressed by the curators of the exhibition in charge of the Hayward Gallery’s new exhibition Kinetic Art Rejoice. The opening night saw a spectacularly well-received exhibition curated by artist Mark Wallinger, himself a renowned figure in the field of kinetic art, and artist and designer Janine Backer. The exhibition is a well-rounded and well-timed celebration of kinetic art in a gallery traditionally renowned for its “empty space” or minimal content.

The exhibition is divided into five sections which each trace a particular aspect of kinetic art. Here is a brief description of each:

- section 1: “In the Beginning: Science and Technology” focuses on the first movements in kinetic art, including Claude Lorrain’s “The Starry Night” and Walter de Maria’s “Piano, 1974”. 

- section 2: “The Body and the Image: 1960-1970” examines the role of the body and body consciousness in two key exhibitions of kinetic art, Tom Wesselmann’s “The Fall of Robot Man” and Jules Olitski’s “Robots Exhibition” (both 1968). 

- section 3: “Crucibles of Fire: 1970-1980” looks at a key exhibition of kinetic art of this period, Joseph Kosuth’s “Paradiso New York” (1973). 

- section 4: “The Mind’"
" The programme was transmitted from 1953 till 1956 on Cleveland’s WWWE.

The Moondog era was a fertile and exhilarating one for all those who were lucky enough to experience it. Here one could hear rock'n'roll songs for the first time, that is, if you were young, on the moondog show, at the right moment and the right volume, and if you felt like dancing! And dancing you did, to the wild rhythms and the exhilaratingly loud and loud-mouthed music of rock’n’roll and its stars. Here were young people singing, dancing and having a wonderful time, all for the pleasure of the music and each other. And if the music was rock'n'roll music, this was all the more enjoyable and beguiling. One was taken away to a world of colour and light; a world where anything could happen. The music made people feel free, unconstrained, almost animal. And when you were in the thrall of the music, and the music happened to be the singing of a Paul Simon, well you were happy.

Moondog was not only music but a kind of carnival: there was singing, dancing and games and prizes. It was the opportunity of a lifetime: the chance of a long holiday and also a chance to meet and be seen by the famous and the beautiful. In a word, Moondog was the opportunity of your life. The"," The show was heard in New York and in other major US cities across the north of the country. It was hosted by the irrepressible DJ Moondog Doppler who provided the platform for local DJs to showcase their latest songs and the best rock ‘n’ roll records of the week. Most of the artists who appeared on Moondog Rock’n’Roll Party were unknown at that time, however the genre would blossom into the arena-shilling pop of the late 1960s and into the more subversive R&B of the 1970s.


Moondog Rock’n’Roll Party was broadcast on the radio in New York in the early 50s. It set the stage for rock music in the USA. Rock music would go on to sweep the USA, and rock’n’roll would evolve into the arena-shilling pop of the late 1960s and into the more subversive R&B of the 1970s.


The rock music that would first sweep the USA in the 1950s was different from the music listened to in New York City. In New York, you heard Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Gene Kranes, and other prominent crooners. The rock music on the airwaves in New York was hosted by Alan Freed. Freed had a radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, which featured DJs from clubs playing rock music. Moondog Rock’n’Roll"," It was, to cite Simon and co-writer Barry, his business partner, “one of the most important events in my life. I was 13 years old when I went to the Apollo Theater in Harlem and bought my first guitar because of Moondog. The audience in the Apollo was mostly teenagers and the influence of Rock & Roll was literally playing in the wings.”  Moondog’s success was due largely to Simon’s own vocal talent, his “blatant sexuality and, yes, his rock & roll image. He was the first white rock star.  And what a image he projected!”  Able to turn his voice into a saxophone, to “belt out the most challenging notes and phrases,” Simon could “sang his way right through any song” and so “everyone wanted to be Moondog”.  But despite his commercial success Moondog Rock was not long for this world. “There were too many young people wanting to be him… too many greedy people who didn’t like what he represented. He was seen as a symbol of easy wealth, he came from the suburbs, the kids didn’t like that he was middle class.”  Moondog was in fact killed by a car while out drinking with friends in Miami Beach on Christmas Day 1970.   But his death has not been in vain.  “Moondog has never died. His spirit lives on in young people all over America who think they can sing"," For a while this was a weekly program on WOR-AM in New York which played the latest up-to-date rhythm and blues on an ever expanding playlist that comprised the newest and most original records released by local and national artists. The program’s host was a DJ, Alan Freed, whose energetic presence on the air was a major draw for his listeners. Moondog had a huge reach and was heard all over America. In the early days Freed played records that were recorded at the time or old hits that were rarely played any more on the Moondog program, only a few numbers were permanently booked. He knew that the fans were there for the fresh and new, so he had little patience for the oldies. But his biggest challenge was to attract the new and the young. In the beginning Moondog was just a radio program and Alan Freed had to play the new hits and create a listenership that would ultimately lead him to a record company.

Freed had worked at various times as a club DJ, in a band and as an impresario, and had also gained a reputation as a recording artist. In his youth he had been a fan of bebop but in his twenties he shifted towards the hard bop style, which was popular at the time with younger and younger generations of jazz musicians. The new hard bop had a rhythmic foundation that was complex, polyrhythmic and disjunctive, in contrast","

After a couple of years of living in a suburb of New York he started broadcasting his show from his birthday party at a dance club called Sammy’s On Broadway. The club, which became one of the most notorious in US history, was actually an old cinema where drugs, prostitution and rock’n’roll culture were flourishing. 

The show’s host Alan Freed was an Italian-American who had started out as a singer in a speakeasy in the mid-1930s and had become famous for his voice and his charm. This would become his trademark and also his downfall when his charisma would make him the ideal prey for the corrupt local mafia which started to finance the club in exchange for a share of the takings. 

At first the show was an overnight sensation, the teenagers loved it. The kids who listened to the show would later form the new musical tastes of the suburban middle classes. In the beginning, the audience listened spellbound to the show that played six days a week with the rock’n’roll classics of the era. But eventually even Freed started to get worried about the state of things and the show became more and more rock-orientated. 

As the 1950s progressed the influence of rock began to seep into popular music, television, movies and the arts. Some argue that rock did more than anything to shape the middle class and therefore also the post-war American society. Rock had not"," This mid-century R&B and Pop show on WGL in New York, which was transmitted at nighttime only between 1950 and 1957, was regarded as a sensation by the youth of America. It was, in fact, the most listened to jazz and rhythm and blues show in the country, a position it maintained for more than 10 years. It had the advantage of being broadcast by a local station known for its R&B music, to an audience not yet familiar with jazz.

The advent of rock and roll at the behest of Alan Freed’s Moondog Rock’n’Roll Party was a significant step in Simon’s life. Like so many other youths in the country, his first exposure to rock was through the radio. And so it is that Simon’s songbook Rock and roll in the 1950s features a large number of the tracks broadcast on Moondog. A few months after the first broadcast, Simon began recording his debut album at the Scepter Studios of New York, produced by Jerry Goldstein. There he met Jim Stewart, who was the A&R man of Scepter and a close friend of Goldstein. The first single, originally intended for Joe and Ethel Merman’s band, was rejected by RCA Records. Goldstein recommended it to his friends at Polydor Records, and the song, “Little Criminals,” was released in 1956 with great success. The success led Goldstein to suggest","

Freed, who came from a rural background and had experienced racism in his youth, promoted and popularised a wide spectrum of new, white rock artists and sounds, and especially the rock ‘n’ roll genre. His aim was to make rock popular among the youth, who were often excluded from mainstream radio and the culture at large. 

He was well aware that in order for the new music to be widely embraced and for people to dance to it, it was needed to become accessible through radio. As a radio DJ he used all means at his disposal to make the new music available to a broad audience, such as changing times and locations of radio broadcasts, changing the content of broadcasts, or even broadcasting excerpts from records.

His Moondog Rock’n’Roll Party was seen as a major step forward in popularising rock music among youth. 

Moondog was broadcast live at night on Alan Freed’s Philadelphia radio station WFIL. By day it could be heard on WVON in the Bronx, and later also on WNBC. 

Simon was not the only rock fan to tune in. There were already several hundred paying customers each week and the programme drew an audience of many tens of thousands. In addition, rock fans came to the radio station in growing numbers. 

Paul Simon’s parents would listen to the radio or buy the records at the local record shop, the Bonwit Teller. Moondog Rock"

Poetry in the mediaeval world 
In Mediaeval Britain, a poet whose work was printed and sold was usually called a ‘romancer’. The mediaeval British word for ‘poet’ was ‘rhapsode’; the word ‘rhapsode’ ultimately comes from the Greek word for ‘enraptured’. In other words, a rhapsode was a one who was ‘rapt’ (enraptured) by a subject (i.e. the arts, poetry, nature etc.). One can see the connection between the mediaeval English word for ‘poet’ and the Greek word for ‘rapt’.
The Latin word for poetry in Roman times was ‘verba dirota’. As an adjective it means ‘spoken words’, ‘uttered words’.
The Roman-British poet Cato (123 – 35 BC) wrote a book called De Arte Coeca (On the Art of Poetry). His Latin text begins with the words 'Quid velim certam verbum dirotam dicere?' (What would I like to say the most famous word of spoken words?).
The word ‘dico’ there is used in the sense of ‘say’ or ‘tell’. ‘Diro’ is the verb in the passage above which means ‘uttered’ and this is very close to the meaning of ‘verba dirotam dicere’. Cato is asking himself the question of what the most famous"," Of the serious critics or poets there are two factions - those who think that poetry should be formal and academic and those who think that the language used in presenting poetry should be as natural and immediate as possible. There are some who take a middle road advocating an appropriate mix of forms and a ‘poetic’ language, though their poems are almost entirely in ‘verse. Poets of the popular variety (though not all in ‘verse) view the idea of the serious poet as being part of an ivory tower and prefer the ‘verse’ to be as crudely political as possible and as flamboyantly sexual as possible. There are of course many exceptions to almost every rule, but overall it seems that in this time of historical uncertainty the best course is to appear contradictory to almost all preconceptions. 

In the present context the most important poetical tendency in the contemporary debate is the recognition that poets are as much ‘part of society’ as anyone else. It seems that the poet must be involved in the social structure and so they should play a strong and active role in the real world. It is said that the poet should be an activist as well as an artist. It is a time for activism and the poet should be a part of the movement to rid society of the archaic roles that the poet was born into and should fight for the social justice that is the true essence of art. 

This is not an easy task, and certainly there are poets who have"," In this debate there are many prominent voices who take the standpoint of the ‘literary’ writers and others who take the position of the ‘popular’ poets. These divergent opinions include such weighty names as Dylan Thomas, Seamus Heaney, T. S. Eliot, William Wordsworth, Philip Larkin, and Elizabeth Bishop amongst many others.  There are more voices on both sides of the argument but the dominant opinions and arguments will seem self evident to a person who has taken an interest in the issue and looked at the various poems on the subject.   

One side is represented by the more literary poet and the other by a less serious, more public poet. The poetic side is represented by some of the most renowned poetries of the past. These include the work of William Blake, John Clare, John Donne, John Dryden, William Wordsworth, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and many others. The popular side is represented by the well known poet laureate Sir Thomas Wyatt, whose poems were originally recited by the bard at court and his contemporaries and for whom the modern ‘popular’ poets tend to speak as if his work was written for the purpose of mere effect and to entertain. The other notable poet is the ‘popular’ poet Phil Ochs whose work and influence is represented by his best known song ‘So Far’, which contains the following lines: ‘Oh Lord, I’m so far from home, I wish"," The present argument concerns the place of poets in society and the place of poetry, i.e. the relative value of creative ‘high’ style and the ‘ground level’ of the popularly expressed experience. The more sophisticated poets tend to believe that there is little poetry that can be published and still survive in a world of literary sophistication, which they see as being too much in the service of ‘artificial niceties’ and not truly addressing the ‘raw stuff’ of experience. In the current climate of disillusionment many of the more ‘popular’ poets believe that their work has a place in the future of poetry which is a place where there are more sophisticated but more accessible to the working classes and less formal poets. A more formal poetic tradition is, arguably, that of the serious poet who seeks to bring order to the chaos of experience and who is not afraid to be explicit about the meaning of the experience being expressed. The more formal poetic tradition may have made great strides in the last century, with its many academic ‘High’ style and ‘Low’ style poems, and its new and exciting use of the vernacular to express the ‘raw stuff’ of experience. The popular poet, on the other hand, is often seen as too informal and even crude to express important truths. The argument may be summarised by suggesting that whilst the more formal poet may believe that the artifice of the literary tradition is distasteful to the serious poet, the opposite is actually"," There is a lot of acrimony about poetry as a social art. 

One can divide the contemporary poets into three broad groups. The first group consists of the serious poets of the printed page, for example Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Gary Kyte and Derek Walcott. These poets write primarily for the serious market, meaning they have published in the literary journals and/or small presses and are paid for what they write. They tend to write more traditional poems, including ‘Ode to a Bank Robber’; however they are also among the most ‘hip’ of contemporary poets. The second group includes the ‘hip poets’; these are the poets and their followers who have taken it upon themselves to perform ‘hip’ poems over a mix of popular music and poetry. This group includes Allen Ginsberg, John Lennon and William S. Burroughs. The third group is made up of the critics and academics, who are more interested in the craft of poetry and are against the popular trend.


There is a lot of acrimony about poetry as a social art. The critics and academics are particularly harsh on the ‘hip poet’s’ approach to performing poetry, which they think lacks the discipline of the serious poet writing for his or her peers. These academics and critics have seen a dramatic decline in poetry sales over the past thirty years, probably because of this lack of discipline. They fear that the ‘hip poets’ have made poetry too easy"," The modern poet seems to have been born in the shadow of Keats and Shakespeare. His or her literary parent has usually been educated at Cambridge University, and it is now almost unfashionable to be uneducated at Cambridge. The poet will almost certainly have had a professional association with a literary magazine and will be acutely sensitive to the expectations of readers who are ‘behind the pay wall’ and are expecting to be seduced and impressed. He or she will probably have a sense of literary style and of the proper balance of syntax and diction that are regarded as being the preserve of the ‘serious’ writer. He or she will often have a sense that this is a high calling and that the rewards will be considerable, so a career as a ‘writer’ may well be planned. The poet may, or may not, have written a published poem, and it is unlikely that he or she is unaware of the fact that poems which are considered to be ‘very good’ in the eyes of the ‘critical’ audience can still be considered to be essentially of limited value for the ‘popular’ reading public and can be discarded with little thought as soon as possible after they have been read. He or she will be very familiar with the work of various modernists and surrealists, and the work of many famous 20th century American and British poets will be familiar to him or her, such as Dylan Thomas, Ted Hughes, Robert Frost and Seamus Heaney. He or she will also of"," This ‘futurist’ poetry is the product of a generation of poet-activists who were angry at the state of things and thought that the way to change it was by denouncing, provoking and provoking again the poetic establishment. The ‘literary’ poets of this age are convinced that the age is mad and that the present poet must be a rebel even as they themselves are rebels.  

“A poem is not a painting”, the modern poet declares.  

But who is to say that the aesthetic of painting is superior to that of poetry? And so the ‘literary’ poet denigrates the ‘popular’ poet who is happy to leave the poem to the intelligence of the audience.   This debate is not just of interest to literary scholars, since most poems today are not intended for publication and so concern the poetic tradition of ‘popular’ verse with its traditional audiences, its commercial imperatives and its general incomprehension.  This is why the contemporary poet is equally concerned with the new social forces which may threaten or influence the poetic order.  The modern poet wants to show that poems can be political and that the poet is no longer merely an idealist, but that poetry is needed now more than ever for the defence of a just society.  There are various strands to the poetical argument, but what they have in common is that all those involved claim that poetry can make a difference, and that the poet has an ethical obligation to"

As the narrative progresses, it is evident that Darwin was not fully aware of contemporary scientific thinking on the topic and the importance that scientists such as Bowlby have ascribed to crying. One of the key themes of the narrative is the notion that Darwin was ""almost certainly wrong"".


Evolutionary psychologist Angela McKeown of the University of British Columbia has suggested that crying may have arisen as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness. Through the medium of crying we can transmit our level of distress, so our level of distress can convey aspects of our personality that may be difficult to convey in other ways.


Crying can be an especially effective way of communicating emotion when it is a solo act. In the presence of other people, it is often less effective. If other people don't know the context of the tears, they may interpret them as signs of being overly upset.


This could be beneficial at a social level because it creates an atmosphere of support and empathy in which the recipient can take a more active part in the resolution of the emotional situation. However this creates an asymmetry to the dynamic, in which one party is not taking part, rather the other is, thereby giving an impression of more imbalance between the parties. This is not always desirable.


Another explanation for the persistence of crying into adulthood is that the sound of crying becomes considerably less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting"," The modern urge to 'cope' with stress and sadness may ultimately be a biological legacy of this adaptive significance.


Crying can be an indication of several underlying conditions and there are several ways of detecting these conditions. The following points summarize the underlying conditions that can cause crying.

* Helplessness: This can be caused by several factors. For example children may feel unduly responsible for an accident or other bad outcome that has been brought on by their own actions. They may feel they have let someone close to them down or that they have disappointed a parent or close friend. Also children may find it hard to deal with a situation in which they have limited control.
* Social Significance: Crying can also be an expression of social significance. Children may cry at the thought of a friend who is sad, or in order to express their sympathy at a sad occasion. They may cry because they are frustrated or because the situation they are in is difficult.
* 'Coping' with Stress: It is possible that crying can become a biological legacy of the need to 'cope' with stress and sadness. Scientists have found that a hormone called ""cortisol"" is produced in response to stress. This hormone can also be produced when adults shed tears. This means that we have the biological capacity to cry in order to cope with stress.

The persistence of crying into adulthood is harder to explain. It seems that the sound of crying becomes considerably less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness.


One explanation is that crying helps regulate the levels of stress hormone (cortisol) in the body.  High levels of this hormone when not needed promote the secretion of tears to wash away the stress. The process is much more effective if the individual is also exposed to the visual signal of tears and this may be one way in which crying became a sign of social connectedness.


There are many evolutionary advantages to being able to cry. They include communicating your need for care whilst also attracting a potential mate. However when it comes to the persistence of adult crying into adulthood it is difficult to explain. One theory is that it is simply a survival instinct which has remained with us to this day.

  *"," It is possible that as children began to leave the nest this evolved into a form of bonding behaviour where babies are carried on the back of a parent to expose them to the external world. This could also have served to teach the young that parents will now be able to provide for them and provide a sense of protection in the world. As children grow up and begin to lead independent lives they may then no longer need to rely on their parents as much and the visual reminder that they are still being carried on the back of a parent may therefore become less important.


The evolution of crying as a social and bonding signal could have several explanations, one of which is the development of capitalism and the growth of family dependence on employment. Under these circumstances infants are often left to fend for themselves while they are cared for by the parents who provide the means of sustenance. The need to rely on others for food may promote the development of the ability to provide this for infants via crying. It is also possible that the development of capitalism lead to a reduction in the provision of resources necessary to sustain infants, such as warm clothing and food. As more and more infants relied on their parents for food and sustenance they would then become exposed to the visual signal of crying to which they would subsequently develop a familiarity. As an infant grew into adulthood they would then begin to rely less on their parents and this would reduce the necessity to express their dependence via crying.

One can speculate that the persistence of crying into","

CRYING Darwin’s theory is contradicted by more recent research. There is clear evidence that crying has a clear evolutionarily purpose. It plays a vital role in promoting social connection and also is vital in helping the human immune system to remove harmful substances.

Darwin was almost certainly wrong, more recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child.

Bowlby suggested that as an adult I would be unlikely to show any outward manifestation of my feelings for quite some time. However a sudden and inexplicable breakdown in a trusted adult could well be explained by a sudden onset of sobbing. It might be possible that even modern adults still respond in so doing, whether intentionally or not.

Crying can be observed in a large number of mammals. However human infants are reported to cry significantly less than other mammals of the same age and size, particularly when hungry. In most species the sound of crying becomes less significant with age. 
Human infants can cry for a range of reasons. If they are hungry their stomachs make crying noises which can be heard from a great distance. Infants can also cry for a number of reasons not related to hunger or otherwise, for example when they are in pain or uncomfortable. 

Modern infants generally do not know how to deal with their emotions or the reasons for their feelings. This is because the human brain, although sufficiently developed to understand cause and effect by the age of 6 months, is still in the process of developing and its functional capacity for analysis is only beginning to develop fully. 

Because of the social and physical demands of life in the twenty-first century many children and their parents now have less time for interaction than did their ancestors. For example, the frequency and duration of contact which a baby and parent have has been shown to decline with the age of the child"
" Happiness! Fame! But what if you are broadcasting something you may wish to keep private? What are your privacy settings? Who will you tell? How do you balance exposing your life with seeking privacy and security?

After the initial shock of being discovered in public, I have had time to reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of public sharing. In short, I now blog in order to tell people about new jobs, travel and life-events, rather than for self-promotion. This has made me think carefully about the balance I seek to strike between sharing my location and revealing more about who I am. In particular, it has forced me to examine the ways in which I protect my most sensitive personal information, such as my health conditions, relationship status and sexual orientation.

The good news is that while there is an element of social pressure to be out and about, I feel more comfortable with my settings now. The better news is that when I do want to broadcast my location, I can ensure that the details are not shared widely, by using location-based services like Wahoo! and Facebook’s Loc8n, which use encryption to prevent the data of nearby devices being shared with third parties.

Overall, while there can certainly be benefits to sharing one’s location, there can also be drawbacks. As the old adage goes, ‘location, location, everywhere, but not necessarily for what you might think’.

So there you go, dear"," Fame! Security! But this begs the question: Is this the right thing to be doing? Is our sharing of ourselves online really changing the world, or just putting more stuff on sale? Some argue that it is the latter. Marketers tell us we naturally gravitate toward what is familiar and popular. We become immune to ‘offensive’ or ‘new’ brands and products. We also enjoy convenience and so, even if we do a bit of research on a new brand, we will typically opt for the easy option and be a regular customer. We have also seen time and again that once a person has been targeted with the right message – and they like the brand – they are much more likely to make a purchase. This raises further questions: is sharing what you eat or what you watch really going to change the world? Some would argue that it is just putting stuff on the open market for sale – and this is, of course, commercial activity. But there is far more to being human, and it is hard to imagine a more basic and basic part of being human than eating and drinking what you’re presented. It’s not hard to imagine that we will share some of the food we eat, or perhaps a picture of it. But is sharing what we watch really going to make the world a better place or simply make people who do not already agree with us happy? It could well be the case that our ability to share what we watch depends on technology making it"," Popularity! Fame! But, more perniciously, the ability to track our every move, with the ability to link this location to a plethora of data about our interests, age, height, weight, gender etc, and therefore predict our every move with extraordinary accuracy. It is now possible to create an ‘anonymised’ profile of each and every one of us, and the ability to match this against a database of people who might have an interest in, say, a particular sports team. Given that the owners of these sports teams might be able to deduce that we live near these people, they might then try to induce us to buy their product, persuade us to go and support their team etc. As for the advertiser, you are now in a position to ‘target’ your ads at a determined set of likely customers. So it becomes possible to create a ‘personalised’ ad which only ‘relates’ to you, rather than simply being a general appeal for people to consider a product. This all sounds fairly dystopian – and it is. But what is more exciting is that the idea is already being discussed, and the idea that people might actually like this sort of targeting does seem to exist. The argument against these possibilities is that this ability to link our every move to data on our past behaviour, our present interests and our general location could be used for more positive purposes – to help us find things we are looking for, organise events we might like to"," Fame! Tantalising new ways to self-soothe whilst watching Netflix. We live in interesting times. I have started to blog about my experiences teaching Grade 2. Some students can be reluctant readers, so I like to use technology to engage them. My favourite tool is Google Classroom, which allows me to share videos, pictures and PowerPoints on any device. I have tried podcasts, but they are hard to download onto students’ laptops, and they often crash the software. On the whole, though, the learners seem to find them a useful way to keep up to date with material, and I don’t have to spend too much time explaining how to use them.

Flesch-Kincaid Reading Assessment

The Flesch-Kincaid reading scale is a scale to measure the language skills of readers as they read a text, and assigns a ‘grade’ ranging from one to ten (with one being the easiest to read and ten being the hardest to read). The Flesch-Kincaid reading scale can help teachers determine whether students can actually read the text, and provides a useful metric to compare year to year within the same school.

You could write a best-selling book! Or, more ominously, it is possible that you might be advertising your ‘out-and-about-ness’ to a ‘pool’ of potential stalkers. So I had better get cracking on the ‘real life’ version of the book I’ve been meaning to write. I’ve stopped posting location updates on Instagram, so the blog is now the real deal. So there we go. That is the short form of the confession. Please be assured that my Instagram confession has only been an expression of the worries expressed on the online warning page – not an admission of guilt. That being said, this is no longer just a blog. It is actually a blog about a blog. The confession has also moved from the virtual realm into the physical world. I bought a mobile phone specifically to be able to check-in to bookstores using the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology built into that phone. The problem was: it kept losing the phone’s charge. So now I have a second phone which is essentially useless. I have been meaning to check that it is actually recording my location – you know, for kicks, just to get to know the new smartphone which has become my confidant. As it is now dark outside I have also actually gone out and been looking for my lost phone. I cannot access Instagram at the moment. If and when I"," Fame! Adoration!

I remember my alarm on that particular morning. It was set for 6:30, a somewhat disconcerting time to be waking up. I was feeling dislocated from the rest of the world. I was looking forward to being ‘alone in my thoughts’, as the Buddhists might say – but alas, this was not to be. My ‘alone time’ was soon interrupted by a message on my phone. It was an alert from Google, my internet provider. It had received a new patent for the ‘Mobile Assist’ service that it had been promoting to me in an email in the preceding weeks – a service that would allow me to have all my internet traffic routed through a ‘server’ that would be located in my phone, and run by it – thereby increasing my data allowance by orders of magnitude – and giving me access to streaming video and music services without me having to plug into the internet. I was particularly excited by this new development – partly because I was curious as to what the legalities of the service actually were, but more because I was reminded that I now have an audience: a large audience of which I’m an unwilling part.

Eat, Live, Love by Julie and Joe Hopkins


This book is the culmination of Julie and Joe's many years of research into the science of taste. They share their own experiences, as well as that of their friends and family, in a fun and engaging way.

The book includes:

- An in-depth and accessible history of the human relationship with food
- The scientific exploration of flavour
- The latest in taste-testing technology
- A guide to mastering the art of eating and drinking well


Eat, Live, Love is full of delicious recipes as well as great insights into the science and art of good eating.

Food is a fundamental requirement of life but we tend to take it for granted. The authors have taken the time to explore this deeply intimate relationship between human beings and food with a wealth of delicious recipes, step-by-step instructions, and fascinating facts about what goes into the making of your favourite dishes.


The authors have managed to make their subject matter accessible and approachable while still being filled with useful and fascinating information. I loved the way they shared both their own family's history of eating together as well as the scientific principles at"," And by cooking from scratch you not only avoid the environmental issues and unnecessary packaging associated with factory-produced sweets but you gain a real sense of achievement and a sense of doing something useful and usefully practical with your hands. Not just an aesthetic or cultural sense but a sense of connection with food and food culture and this is so important for children in today's world. Food represents so much more than just sustenance. It is an aesthetic and cultural statement. There is something inherently satisfying and reassuring about having a few home-cooked meals that have been prepared by someone you know and whose taste you admire. A childhood spent in the kitchen with your mother or grandmother cooking from scratch gives children a strong sense of who they are and who they want to be. The satisfaction of cooking from scratch can be a source of self-esteem and pride. I love this book. I've been meaning to cook these recipes from it for years. And they are so easy. There's so much pleasure in knowing you are doing something that makes people happy and it makes good environmental sense as the ingredients are often cheap and readily available. You don't have to go to the shop to buy a packet of pasta. It will taste just as good without the packaging and fossil fuels. All this makes cooking from scratch worth doing for many reasons. And because I like this book so much, and as my mother does most of the cooking, I have set about trying the recipes. I must say, I am in awe"," Cooking, in a sense, is the art of fine tuning the relationships between the raw ingredients. No ingredient is wasted. The joy of cooking comes from knowing that you are using all the food in your fridge to make pasta sauce or soup and eating some at dinner and discarding some to make some broth you can use tomorrow or freezing for another meal. The first recipe in this book is an excellent way to discover how to use the three main groups of ingredients - vegetables, herbs and pulses - and some dairy products such as milk, yoghurt and buttermilk.  	

The carrot, leek and celery soup  is both delicious and nutritious.  Carrots provide vitamin A, leeks contain vitamin A and K, vitamins C and K as well as a mix of B vitamins and celery provides iron, potassium and folate.  If you have left over vegetables then you could make a tasty cold soup using one of the recipe in this book such as the lentil and vegetable soup, or for a warmer weather treat a strawberry and avocado soup. You could also use the leftover vegetables to make a pasta sauce. 

Carrots are also incredibly nutritious.  A single portion has around 120 calories which is comparable to a medium-sized apple.  Carrots are also high in fibre, iron, folate and contain compounds that can help to promote the release of mood-enhancing chemicals in the brain.

Making carrot"," There is something intrinsically satisfying about taking something complex like a souffle or making spaghetti Bolognese. I don't mean you have to be a professional chef to do it well but a few simple skills along the lines of knowing how much olive oil to use for a given amount of pasta and a good collection of everyday sauces will ensure that you get something delicious every time.


Foods requiring careful consideration include: chocolate mousse, spaghetti Bolognese, souffle. Foods that can be obtained easily and without any special skills include: carrots, leeks, celery.


Culinary Arts:  There is much that could be learnt from the arts of cooking. I often think that the most important skill a cook needs to be competent is a sense of when something is over-complicated. There is something intrinsically satisfying about taking an element that is complex and making it easier. One can serve soufflés that are delicious without knowing anything about the science of eggs, sugar and other proteins that go into them but they will not make soufflés like this one:

The most important concepts in cooking: 

- proportioning ingredients, a key component in spaghetti bolognese and soufflés
- texture and mouth feel, the importance of the eggs in mousse.
- flavour, which can be enhanced by the various flavours in the herbs, lemons and onions used in this"," You will enjoy this a great deal. 

Now contrast this with the first sentence of the next page: 

Food is an important part of who we are and our culture and has given rise to a variety of cuisines and recipes around the world.

In this passage the word'Food'occurs 7 times in the first sentence, 9 times in the second sentence and 10 times in the conclusion.  Note that the CEFR scale has only 7 levels, so we are unlikely to find many A2 learners for this passage.

Note: CEFR has been updated since this passage was written.

"," And who said you had to be fully dressed to enjoy a meal? Some nights the children will be most lively and some nights you may wish to be more formally attired. But the food will still be warm and the wine or another drink will be flowing and the company will be most pleasurable. We will remember this dinner as the best of many.

  * Total words: 6-8 (excellent)
  * Total sentences: 8-10 (very good)
  * Total syllables: 6-8 (very good)

  * Although not an everyday occurrence, there will be occasions when you would like to prepare a special meal. These occasions may be for a guest, a birthday, or special celebrations. Because of this, you will want to ensure you can turn out a tasty dish using basic ingredients and equipment. 
  * As a guest: You might eat at your home or the home of a family friend. As a guest you would be most welcome, but most guesthouses and private homes will not offer cold refreshments. Instead, it is the norm to warm up a little food for your arrival. The type of food and how you warm it up will vary by region and by time of year. In colder climates you may find roasted nuts and dried fruit provided an opportunity to warm up a snack. In warmer regions a bowl of grapes or bowl of peanuts will often suffice. Regardless, there is no reason you cannot warm up a"," You will need just a few simple ingredients, chocolate, cream, eggs and sugar. Most supermarkets have these ingredients in plastic tubs just for this purpose. Just look at the way these ingredients enhance each other. In addition you will need a blowtorch or a hotplate to cook the dish which will need to be in an air-tight container in the fridge until serving. 

By using your hands and imagination you can solve any problem. An egg in one hand and a fork in the other you just need to crack the egg and mix it around until it is of a uniform consistency then add a pinch of salt and pepper then dip the fork into the mixture to make thin lines that fan out into long thin strips. These you need to fan out across the plate you are eating from until they are fully joined, it is as simple as that. Alternatively if you are faced with two plates of food with differing textures you can pick one up and put it to your lips until it is at last encountered with a similar texture to your own, so much so that your own cheeks ache at the thought of such bliss. All you need is your sense of taste and smell and a bit of imagination.

But I was ill-prepared for what life as a chef really was like. To begin with, after college I didn’t have a kitchen to come home to. All my friends were working in the restaurant business. I soon realised that the kitchen really is the home of the chef. Like any other home it is a place of friendship, family and love. But the kitchen is where it all happens. There are a small number of really great kitchens: places where the chef and his or her team create the menu and deliver the meals. The chef’s style, the chef’s influence and the chef’s personal flavour become part of the DNA of that space. It has a personality: a vibe. In that sense the kitchen really is a microcosm of the chef. And that is something I didn’t appreciate at first. In my youth the kitchen wasn’t a place for affection and support. It was a place of grumpiness and discontent. It was like many homes that I’d grown up in: it was what it was. 

But as I worked my way up the ranks, it became increasingly clear to me that all chefs have their own distinctive style. It develops as you gain experience in your craft and become more comfortable with your tools. All chefs make their dishes look different. You might start off by preparing a classic French dish: a classic, classic dish will look like a classic, classic dish. It will have"," I found the cooking too. It was, after all, the same stuff my mum would make for my dad’s lunch. I soon realised the kitchens at university were not designed for cooks to be enthusiastic; their only role was to do what they were told and produce the food in a timely and sterile fashion. But for the Lure of the Kitchen I decided to give it a go. It was, after all, only my future. So with great humility I took to the forks. And I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it. I loved the rhythm of long days in the kitchen. I loved the process of combining my ideas on what to make with the practicalities of cooking that needed to be done. I loved the satisfaction of seeing people eating the food we created that they loved. Soon I was on my feet. My colleagues started to see me in a new light. I was being sought out for all-important lunches where I regaled my audience with tales of my exploits in the kitchen. And my university, so hostile to so much of my nature, was opening up for me. Suddenly I was the life of the party. No longer did I feel excluded or alone. I was, in fact, one of the gang. But things started to take a sinister turn. My chefs began to notice that I had begun to take liberties. They were growing jealous. Their jealousy was compounded by the fact that they began to suspect I was stealing their ideas"," I went to university knowing virtually nothing about food. I just picked a subject that looked easy, applied myself, did my best at school, and then spent the next few years slapping bacon on a grill or making a hash of it. But the more I learned the more I realised the subject offered little in terms of practical skills. The more I delved into the subject the more apparent it became to me that there were no skills of the kind that would enable you to cook reliably well beyond the ability level of a weekend cook. I had to change my mind about this. I began to learn about food science and how much more there was to the subject than simply the techniques of cooking. When I started going to cooking school I already knew quite a lot about modern food science. I had studied at University and had picked up a smattering from reading food magazines and internet tutorials. But it wasn’t enough. The science of cooking is an order of magnitude more complex than that of modern food science. But the sheer intellectual challenge of understanding the science drove me on. In the process I also realised how little I actually knew. I still don’t really know enough. I know enough to be ignorant.  

As a chef I went on to open one of the most famous restaurants in London, my family live in the centre of London, and am still very happy with my choice and my decision to go into this field.  

But  that  was back in the","

I joined my local village Cooks’ Club. Most of my friends joined this. We would spend our weekends roasting chestnuts and making soufflés. The chefs would show up, we would make them snacks to munch on during prep. The weekends, while dreary, were bearable. We spent our evenings together and at the end of the club night, a raffle would be held for prizes. It was here that I discovered wine. I would get very drunk and be escorted home by a friend who was a bartender. I would stand in line at the wine store for an hour. I would then drive to a nearby winery, walk inside, and order a glass of wine. There were no waiters and the wine had to be poured for me from a tap. It was then, while standing there waiting for my drink, that I noticed the barrels of wine stacked up on an adjacent field. I drove back to the village store and bought a case of wine. I bought what seemed like a lot: one case of each wine imaginable. My case still sits in my closet. It was now that I realised that the village had been selling my club wine to residents at a discount for decades. I went on to join a winemaking society and learned the process of making wine at a boutique winery. It was here that I fell into the trap of becoming a victim of my own success. I was so busy running my"," My parents had grown up in a French-speaking village in Quebec. I was surrounded by the language of my childhood. I knew my way around the kitchen and I fancied that perhaps I might learn to cook my own supper one day. I studied a couple of years at the CÉMES culinary school. I was lucky. The student life was fun, I liked the friends I made, and I took to the kitchen. There was a feeling of camaraderie with my fellow chefs. The work was not so bad. I was making decent money and my food tasted sufficiently delicious. I stayed a couple of years after my graduation. This was too long. My cooking became repetitive. My meals became routine. I spent my free time reading, or playing computer games, or watching sports. I took some time off, to spend with my family, to visit friends. I did find a kind of calm in this hiatus. But then my parents offered me a job as a line cook, and I made a quick choice. I don't know that I regret it. What does now appeal to me? There are few constants in life. Being a chef is not a constant. There are bound to be ups and downs. But for now, this suits me. As an American would say, I am enjoying what I'm doing. It is a challenge. I can see where I can improve. It's not perfect - I don't pretend that it is. But the feeling"," My friends and I would gather in the evening after classes, talk and eat pizza. My roommate, and eventual wife, would prepare dinner each night. This life held great promise for our future, for our kids’ future. It seemed that there was no limit to the opportunities that lay ahead. And so I became a chef. And I was happy. And we had children. And now my friends and I are no longer chefs, we are retirees. But our lives remain happy and blessed. By all accounts a good life is one lived well. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale is an educational standard designed to quantify reading abilities. It takes into account word length, sentence length, and the number of syllables in a sentence. The higher the score the better a reader the text is likely to be for the student. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale ranges from zero to 100 with the perfect score being achieved on a document that has equal sentence length and syllable count to a single sentence. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale, unlike other reading measures, can be used to analyze documents written by someone other than the test-taker (e.g., essays, speeches, book reviews, etc.) The following narrative has a Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 74.3 and is therefore very difficult to read.

‘Please forgive the mess,’ he said, ‘my father is an architect who has built every room of this house. He is currently working on the bedroom and has a rather distinctive style so things tend to get a bit wonky. My mother is a florist and has a bit of a wild streak so she also has a hand in it all.’

‘It’s lovely, where is the bathroom?’

He led me through the house with the bedroom being at the rear. The toiletries were of the latest and best making your journey all the more pleasurable. He then took me to the large upstairs room that overlooked the garden. Here his bed sat in the corner, there was an extremely large window that gave views of the river and the nearby gardens. And the view across the river to the cathedral in the distance was breathtaking.

‘You will have noticed that there is no bath,’ he said. ‘There’s a tub that is currently being used for a variety of purposes but there’s an enormous window that looks over the garden that I am told would be suitable for a swimming pool. So, you’re welcome to use the garden one.’

‘I would be delighted,’ I replied. ‘I have often wished to swim in this window but I haven’t had the space. So this would be a dream come true.’

He pulled a face and then said ‘Look Mum, it’s a swimming"," He had inherited a rather shambolic music hall in the middle of a refurbishment from his recently departed father. 

I was immediately struck by two things about Andrew that were quite unusual. First was his extraordinary knowledge of music, secondly his natural talent for composing. He had produced an album of musical parodies entitled “Oh! What A Lovely War!” which was the talk of the local conservatory, and he had managed to persuade the boy’s father to let him keep the room on condition that he produced nothing more controversial. Andrew was an early promoter of digital recording and recording technology and he was passionate about finding better ways of making albums, touring and promoting music.

He invited me to view his records and to hear them when they came on the stereo, by which time I was quite smitten. “Would you like to hear some of my songs?” he asked. He proceeded to sing a selection of his songs which included “Don’t Cry for Me, Atlanta”, “Ev’ry Time We Say Goodbye”, “Send in the Clowns” and “Don’t Cry Love” which he insisted was one of the most popular songs ever written. 

I was quite amazed and not least because he had managed to convince his father to let him do exactly that. He was clearly going to become quite famous if his father would just let him do his own thing and not try and run him into a Covenant Society. I asked"," He had formed a rock band Phantom of the Opera. He had written a musical called Cats. It was going to the West End. I was meant to talk him into paying the cost of it. I don’t suppose I shall ever know.

TIM RICE That was the first time I had been in a musical.  The production values seemed quite out of date for a musical of that era. The lighting was poor. The sound was tinny. The choreography was dull and the story seemed to wander aimlessly from one set piece to another. The songs were all rather standard fare and although there were several dance numbers the set and costume design were a little anemic.  It didn’t stop it going on to win 11 oscars and spawn 5 other musicals including: Cats, Phantom of the Opera, The Phantom of the Opera, The Wizard of Oz and School of Rock.


And so we come to Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Not the most talented of composers he had the luck to stumble into a world that was ripe for exploitation.  Music of the time was not recorded and performances were live on stage. He was fortunate in that the theatre owners used an amateur recording system developed by Gramophone. As a result of this system it became possible to make exact recordings of any performance. In other words any musician could be paid a small fee to attend a show and, if they were sufficiently talented, their performance could"," I knew this already because he was the most famous musician in the world. His father was in his former office, which was now filled with more books and CDs than you could shake a stick at and Andrew himself was at my left elbow preparing for his first school concert the next day. My eyes strayed to a painting of a red-haired woman which, in my naivete, I assumed to be his mother.  She was, however, in fact the artist’s wife.

TIM RICE This was not a random assemblage of rooms but rather the domain of one of Britain’s most successful musical exports who, at the age of 15, had an allowance of £300 a year to buy records and had a well-stocked library. In his youth he had travelled to all corners of the globe to perform and perform again. As I entered the room, his mother was preparing for her concert that night, but I could tell she wasn’t terribly excited, which was strange, because she loved to perform.  Aged nine he was the youngest cellist in London to be picked for a touring ensemble and in the process had found a passion for the violin, the piano and chamber music. The solo he was going to play in the school concert, based on a Rachmaninoff piano piece that had been one of his father’s favourite pieces, was, to him, the culmination of a lifelong study of his father’s music in"," He had a beautiful, cultured voice that would one day take the world by storm. When I left this was the only room in the house that did not have a hole in the roof. But this did not dampen the spirits of his friends and family who, despite living in an unfinished house, seemed unbothered. The boyhood home of Sir Cliff Richard was the location of Andrew’s first professional job as a chorister in the church of St George’s Horsham. There was a huge space in the church for the choir and Andrew and his sister would stand in the stalls and sing with the Horsham Cathedral Choir. I was also told that Andrew was a very keen violinist. A few years later he was a member of the London Symphony Orchestra and performed his solo violin concerto under the direction of the great Sir Charles Mackerras at the Royal Albert Hall. It was there he met his third wife, the great soprano Joan Sutherland. They married, had two children and became the proud parents of the five millionth person who was named Andrew Lloyd Webber. The following week Andrew was invited to the house of one Sir James Gatell-Jones who was one of Andrew’s chief investors. James, who was known to all as Jim, had grown up in Andrew’s home town of Chalfont St Giles and had first heard Andrew perform at the age of seven when his family were staying at the home of the local vic"," He was aged about 23, which made him somewhere around six foot two inches or so which would make him the tallest person I had ever seen. He was of an imposing physical presence, both in physique and the assurance with which he carried himself. He appeared to be comfortable in his own skin, to some extent.

TIM RICE Andrew Lloyd Webber was one of the most popular British composers of the 1980s, known for his musicals such as Starlight Express and Grease.


Flesch-Kincaid Grade is a scale designed by Don Howard and Phil Kessler, based on how easy it is to understand text when viewed against a specific background. The scale ranges from 100 for very easy to -7 for very difficult.  Flesch-Kincaid Grade measures total words, total sentences, and total syllables in a passage.


Flesch read 4812 total words, which places it in the middle of the Grade scale at a score of 4812.

Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 4812 total words

Grade 7: 4829 total words

Grade 8: 4870 total words

Grade 9: 4955 total words

Grade 10: 4919 total words


Flesch-Kincaid Grade is the second easiest grading method according to Howard, behind the Flesch Reading Ease formula which looks at word recognition.

As we were seated in the drawing room I noticed a large painting of a classical Greek scene on the wall to my right and felt instantly at home.  He opened the wine and I tasted the 2005 Bordeaux the colour of blood and the bouquet was overwhelming.  He asked if I was going to live the life of a rock star and I said yes.  He asked me if I could play an instrument and I said yes I can play the piano and sing. He said he had a spare room in his house and asked me if I wanted to stay with him in the summer holidays. I said yes. I now have a beautiful house in the country, a record player and a stereo. And I am rich.

" In the ad industry it meant cut after cut after cut -  on TV, in print, radio. On all media. Not just the traditional media of cinema, theatre and television but also digital media - video, radio, email. And it was not just advertising agencies. Consultancies, production companies, manufacturers - everyone.  The business of advertising had ground to a halt. No wonder advertising agencies started to break up. And the ones that didn't go under started to merge. So did the rest of the industry. It happened across Europe, and to some degree in America with the rise and rise of a new competitor - internet advertising. The internet would only go mainstream with mobile broadband and the huge increase in ""smartphones"". 
The merger frenzy The 1990s was the last decade of the Cold War, with nuclear weapons still a reality on the ground in Europe, and the threat of all-out war was always present. As a result advertising agencies became far more security conscious. When one or two agencies were merged with or absorbed by another, the merger would typically include extensive due diligence into both the financial situation, and the security posture of the new business. If there was anything left of the old advertising agency by then it was unlikely to be a threat to anything or anyone. 

The merger frenzy continued and by the year 2000 there were no fewer than 26 Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) announced in the American advertising industry during the first five"," Even so, the advertising industry turned to the creative side to survive. It found its own 'golden age'. The decade’s first globally significant ad campaigns for Mervyn's (dry cleaning), BMW (cars) and even Microsoft (office software) were born. In many ways the 1990s were the peak of creativity in the industry, where bold ideas were tested and publicised. But for all the creativity there was a lack of original ideas and not enough innovation. There was too much reliance on established methods such as focus group testing which is known to be flawed. In the 1990s a new approach to advertising – called neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) emerged. A groundbreaking discipline which used hypnosis to test ideas on participants’ subconscious brains. Hypnosis was combined with a combination of well-known scientific studies showing what words mean on the subconscious level and what images trigger specific emotions. The combined effect was to tap into the subconscious mind, unlocking hidden, hidden desires. The technique, originally developed for advertising, was refined into a scientific discipline in the early 2000s. The effect was to tap into the subconscious mind, unlocking hidden desires. And it worked. One of the first NLP campaigns for Mervyn's was launched in 1995 using clever use of hypnosis to unlock desires for a dry-cleaning service with the tagline ‘We do what we say we’d never do’. The tagline became"," 

These were heady and uncertain times, but by the summer of 1992 you were beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. 

And when the light does eventually arrive it will come from the convergence of two powerful forces. The first is the growing ubiquity of the internet as a source of both information and consumer demand for the services of internet-based companies. The second is the increasing maturity of the medium itself. Advertisers and agencies alike have realised that the internet is now the home for much of the consuming public, and has access to vast pools of data about what people want and how they react to messages. It is also a highly segmented medium where data mining and targeting are effective in delivering highly effective campaigns. 

What began as a trial run in the early 1990s has become a fully fledged advertising agency. It's a period that saw the agency flourish from a small shop on the Edgware road in London to one of the preeminent boutiques of our generation. This is a success story of the agency as an industry and of individual practitioners as well.

The agency's key personnel today are in their early to mid-40s and include a senior creative director, an art director, a copywriter, a digital director, a director of product, and several other members of the creative team as well as an account executive and a copy assistant. It is staffed by ambitious, hard-working and talented individuals who in the early","

But with budgets already slashed across the board and the economy expected to return to growth in a few years the advertising business had to look for growth within and what better place to look than within the firm itself! 

Recession or no recession the advertising business needs its ideas and concepts to remain fresh. So when the opportunity to partner with a creative agency in another city arose you leapt at the chance. 

The new environment you were to enter was not for the faint hearted. At the beginning your division was unheard of even in your home city of London but to build your business you needed to win market share from bigger rivals and so your initial task was to prove that your agency had a unique offering that set it apart from your rivals. 

So your division put together its first big campaign in the new office in another city. The account in question was for a new brand of coffee. It was the beginning of many successful years to follow.

But you did not just copy the work and ideas of your rivals. You added your own distinctive mark. And you created an entirely new campaign built around your client's new brand identity. 

This campaign won you your first advertising account in a city which had been the domain of your rivals. And from that point on for the next decade you would be able to say with some pride that the business you created was both recognised internationally and a success in the market that had up to then seemed to be the exclusive", The advertising industry was hit harder than almost any other sector as its high paying commissioning clients were forced to reduce spending and often cut ad budgets in the thousands. The 1990s also saw an oversupply of advertising and marketing collateral and a number of failed mergers and acquisitions in the industry. The nadir seemed to be reached in 1995 when in the UK alone some 30 per cent of total spent on advertising and marketing fell below the cost of production. Advertising agencies were severely hit although the biggest and most iconic were often unscathed as they were better diversified. In the US the recession was much deeper and lasting but in the medium term had much less severe and damaging consequences. In fact the US recession of 1990-1995 saw a modest increase in GDP. This was partly as a result of an earlier expansion in the 1980s but also due to a burst of productivity and the rise of the tech bubble. Ad spending nevertheless fell 6.3 per cent in 1996 with more than half the decline occurring in the later years of the decade. As a result the number of US advertising account executives was cut in half and advertising expenditures declined 4 per cent. In Asia Pacific and Latin America advertising budgets in the late 1990s also faced serious reductions. In Latin America in particular the decade had been a boom period with the spread of free television and radio advertising. As a result advertising budgets there declined 7 per cent in 1998. One of the most difficult aspects for the advertising industry was the increased popularity of the," There was recessionary panic in America and Europe, as well as in Japan and Russia. You may have worked during this period with clients who expected to re-enter the black in a matter of months or, like many, considered that the next downturn was the start of an extended upturn. You may well have worked with people who were unceremoniously shown the door and whose fate was to spend the next two years living from pay-check to pay-check.  

You probably worked in the advertising industry. The advertising industry was in crisis then, and this may well have been a contributing factor to the difficult early years of the 1990s. A recession is always difficult, and having just finished the hardest recession in a generation would not have helped. Many of your colleagues left the industry, or found themselves working for smaller or smaller companies. Some of those that stayed cut their work hours to keep afloat. There is a famous quote from a business magazine in the early 1990s that went: ""In the advertising business, everything looks like an assault on a company's reputation."" And in the early 1990s we could see many a company faltering. There was an over- emphasis on quantity of ad impressions, and a certain degree of blindness to the nuances of how a consumer made a purchase. And this perhaps stemmed from a certain complacency as to the efficacy of the ""fire and forget"" nature of television and other media, which meant that the ad"," It was one of the most challenging times of our lives. My own work experience would have been that of one who would have lost their job between 1991 and 1993, although I did not personally suffer the immediate effects, the effect on my employer was immediate the effect on our people was far more severe and long term. We had to reduce our headcount; we had to reduce our operating costs. We had to re-evaluate our product portfolio and our pricing strategies. It was tough going but we got there in the end. By the third quarter of 1993 we had achieved our goal we had reduced our headcount by ten percent and, although we were not yet where we wanted to be, we were starting to see the benefits. In the first half of 1993 we had seen an improvement in our operating margin and we were seeing a significant improvement in our customer renewal rates which were starting to show through in improved response rates. Our cost base was starting to come down. So was our headcount and by June of 1993 our business was starting to pick up and by September, with our new CEO in place and with a more positive operating outlook for the rest of the year, we ended the year in a strong position. We had successfully navigated the crisis and emerged stronger for it, whilst also reducing costs and increasing customer satisfaction.

Let’s begin by acknowledging that poetry is not something you need to learn by rote. Some of the greatest have never taken a formal class nor attended a writing course. The creative process is dynamic and unfolds over time.

A poem should be as easy to read as a road map but also as complex and intriguing as a mystery novel. The first step is to write a ‘bad’ poem — i.e. one that feels unwise or even ill-advised. This is not a criticism but a way of identifying what the ‘wrong’ choices are. If you have not written a poem that makes you cringe then you have not written a bad poem. Try writing one that you might say ‘misses the mark’ and see if it becomes easier to read. If it still makes you squirm — good! You are on the way to developing a sense of rhythm and making your language more fluent.

The most difficult thing about writing poetry is knowing when to stop and make room for others to fill in the blanks. There are rules but each poem is unique. One poem is not the same as another. The same is true of life, although in this regard life presents us with the challenge of living without rules. It is possible to make judgements about the merits of life while still being open-minded and non-judgemental. If the rules of poetry do"," It all comes down to attitude. So enjoy the journey but beware of the boulders and steep hills, for it is in the high-lands of the imagination that the strongest flowers grow and some of these flowers can cause havoc with your worldview. I leave the writing of poems to the poets.

  1. The first line of a poem should have a strong hooking sentence.

  2. Follow the hook with a description of the setting and the mood.

  3. Move to the conflict and the turning point.

  4. Close with a call to mind.

  5. Look for repetition of word(s) from the previous lines in the body of the poem.

  6. Try to vary the use of conjunctions (and, or, but, nor, yet, yet, or, but, nor, yet, yet).

  7. Look for repetition of word(s) from the previous lines in the lines of the body of the poem.

  8. Use alliteration (words or sound made similar) and assonance (words or sounds made similar by placing the final consonant or vowel on a different position in the word).

  9. Use alliteration and assonance in the line breaks of the poem.

  10. Vary the length of each line.

  11. The rhyme scheme should rhyme every other line with the first two lines of a"," The latter group includes me but that doesn't mean I can't learn from those that do need the rope of safety. So, I shall give you pointers with an open mind.  

A poem is made up of 2 main elements, lines and rhymes, both of which serve a specific purpose.  

Lines: Lines should be around 8-13 characters in length and should be of equal length. They are an exposition of ideas and should be delivered with conviction and feeling.  

Rhyming words: Words in a line should be either rhyming or be of similar nature and character. For example, the words 'rain', 'dark', 'fall' are very suitable for rhyming and make for a powerful line. However, the line 'Rains dark on the earth, falling like the bludgeon of God' is much more powerful if the words are not rhyming, for it hints at the catastrophic impact of ill-timed rain.  

Poetry is an individual art form that can be learnt through countless hours of reading, observing and intuition.  

Some important general pointers:
1. Pick a subject or a situation that you know well and explore it from a different angle. 

2. Practice the poem out loud, especially the rhyming words.

3. Don't be afraid to leave lines out! Some of the greatest poems in the English language have very short lines, for"," Still others can simply start writing at random and within a short while be halfway through a poem. Whichever way you look at it you are well advised to set yourself a goal which is more than just a line or two. Many people seem to write a poem as an exercise in futility, for example because it is a university assignment or because they see it as a vehicle for self-indulgence. Poetry is a form of self-expression so justifying any use of it as a crutch for self-esteem is unacceptable. However, just setting down the words on a page for the sheer joy of it can also be considered a worthwhile exercise. Poetry can also be a form of catharsis, that is, a release of pent up anger, pain, frustration, etc. If you feel this way then start writing a poem. There is no right or wrong way; just start writing and let the words flow. There are some general rules of thumb you should follow but these can be ignored as you wish. The following two rules relate to rhyming and in many languages a consonant at the beginning of a line counts as a vowel at the end so ""to err is human, to forgive is divine"" can be rearranged as ""to err is human, to human is forgive divine."" So you can rhyme or you can not rhyme ""err"" and ""divine"" as long as you do not mix up the consonants and end each st"," Some writers have an inherent sense of rhythm and a way with words that comes easily; for others, writing poetry is more of amusement: it just flows and one is transported into a world of imagination, hope and optimism. Some say poetry is just like sleep, if you want to write poetry you need to get some sleep. I disagree.


Poetry is not easy but it is very rewarding. The most rewarding part of poetry is that the writer feels like they have conveyed something meaningful to someone. That is what is most satisfying. This does not come without effort and a lot of hard work. But it is definitely worth it!


Now let's apply this to the CEFR scale:

How to Write Poetry: Spontaneity is the order of the day.  But one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. 

Setting oneself up as a know-all is dangerous so I have decided to side-step the whole issue by saying that for someone just beginning to write no advice can be a substitute for abundant reading extensive writing and the freeing of the imagination and spirit in whatever way seems fruitful barring total anarchy.

Some people need their life to be reasonably secure before a poem will come; others can write their way out of misery. Some writers have an inherent sense of rhythm and a way with words that comes easily; for others, writing poetry is more of aamusement: it just flows and"," Ultimately every writer has the right to her own style. One of my favourite books (there are many) is The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. In it, the main character, Dorian Gray, ages incrementally with each sip of the elixir that is presented to him as 'beautiful'. This passage is the best way I know how to describe poetry; that is, the process of becoming more than the words themselves imply. It is the journey of discovery rather than the discovery itself. Wilde’s Dorian Gray becomes more beautiful, more honest, more talented, and therefore more guilty all the while. What is most remarkable is the complexity, ambiguity, depth and beauty of the passage.  When we read this passage, we find the following elements of poetry:
1. A striking first line (the 'picture')
2. Implied structure (the elixir)
3. Alliteration (the vases)
4. Conjunctions (the languish)
5. Tertiary meaning (the saccharine elixir)
6. Metaphor (the elixir ages)
7. Personification (the vases and languish)
8. Animate objects (the vases)
9. Allusion (the portrait)
10. Biblical allusion (the picture of Dorian Gray)
We have all encountered poetry in our lives, which means that"," It all boils down to what you want to achieve and whether you are ready to suffer like that. 
One approach is to follow the path of least resistance and for example start with a couple of refrains and then fill them with imagery and imagery, varying the rhymes and styles. The rhyming can serve to focus the reader's attention in one particular direction or present an opportunity to develop other aspects of the poem. 
There is another approach in a book 'The Rhythm Game' by William Vollman and the concept of free verse poetry - no starting point, no rhymes or end points; the only rule is to avoid a direct correlation between the words in the poem and the sounds that make up the words and let the words take you where the poet feels the poem needs to go. This can take some time to master but can have the advantage of a much broader range of possible phrases and images as well as giving the poet space to develop a unique language and poetic idiom that is unique to him/herself. 
All in all, poetry can be a very enjoyable (if hard work) and rewarding exercise but be warned, all advice is just that - advice - not instructions.

" The first few Manifesto’s in the field, from a few pioneers including J.Z. Young (the founder of literary Criticism as a Do-it-yourself activity) and Hans-Jörg Ustelhofer (one of the pioneers of Open Access as a professional method) received a mixed reception. However in its early days this self-taught online literature Criticism actually has a certain charm to it. Even though no university would provide you with this professional qualification, and even though you are self-taught, you still get to try your skills out in the world of open criticism which you were not able to gain as part of a university study. In his book “Self-taught literary criticism: the DIY guide” Peter M. Hastorf talks about how in his opinion Self-taught literary criticism is more than just harmless fun. It is, in his opinion, a valuable and worthwhile activity. At least at that time, when information and data were expensive and difficult to access, Self-taught literary criticism represented a unique opportunity to critically evaluate books and other literary works and offer your opinion before the information was officially available. That is, Self-taught literary criticism has contributed to the democratization of information in our time. Self-taught literary criticism is, in this author’s opinion, a good example of “more than just harmless fun”, and a suitable counterpart to Open Access to the Internet", Do-it-yourself literary criticism has been going since the early days of the Internet. The idea is to critically read a novel or book yourself. It is not necessarily about reading the same text as the author as many critics have criticized. It is more of a self-criticism of the critic and not of the work they have reviewed. Do-it-yourself literary criticism has been going since the early days of the Internet. The idea is to critically read a novel or book yourself. It is not necessarily about reading the same text as the author as many critics have criticized. It is more of a self-criticism of the critic and not of the work they have reviewed. Do-it-for-all-literacy is one possible direction that Do-it-yourself literary criticism could have gone in. Since many children in class were not yet proficient in typing or computer use it might have been provided as an alternative. Since many children in class were not yet proficient in typing or computer use it might have been provided as an alternative. However the idea of free and unlimited access to literary criticism online was too enticing to ignore. The idea of an e-journal for literature lovers had actually already been conceived before Amazon.com. Many of them already had their own opinions on which authors to recommend and which books to read. It could even be argued that at that point the Internet had already fulfilled its mission of providing everyone free access to information.," Literary criticism could be as simple as listing out the merits or faults of a book. Books were not treated as sacred objects like they used to be in the past. On the contrary they were treated with a certain amount of disrespect. Even though the general public was able to publish manifestos or give critical reviews, this did not necessarily mean they were taken into consideration by the authors or publishers for the publication of new books. At least not without certain technical know-how. In the end this had as much to do with the established hierarchical power structure of the publishing industry as it did with the technical know-how of the online users. However the newfound ability to openly criticize books meant that the publishing industry could no longer claim that they were able to control the dissemination of critical information as effectively as they had been able to do previously.  

As literary criticism had been restricted to a rather small circle of technologically adept online users the Internet was transformed into the primary source of literary criticism in the beginning.  Not only were new manifestos published on the Internet, but these manifestos were usually used as a starting point for one’s own literary criticism as well.  One could start with a manifesto and then go through the book one-by-one in search of points that one felt could be improved or criticized.  This led to what some would call “do-it-yourself literary criticism.”  The ease and immediate gratification one got from criticizing books"," Since this was an idea that had been proposed before the Internet itself had even been invented, the idea of do-it-yourself literary criticism had become a reality. It was not just the few who could now criticize a book but a whole new generation of readers, critics and writers. They would browse the Amazon.com site and then copy out their reviews into a journal. There were even automated programs that helped guide the reader through a book to find flaws and strengths. The most obvious strength of Amazon.com was undoubtedly the search feature. Not only was it possible to search by author, title or even an entire book series. But it was also possible to search for authors within the site by their first name. By now the idea of do-it-yourself literary criticism had become so ingrained in the popular culture that it had spread to less tech-savvy countries. In China anyone with a computer and access to the Internet was now capable of publishing a literary criticism journal and, at least in the early stages, had the possibility to generate a decent income from this hobby. On the other hand, the literary criticism journals published by Amazon.com had a dual purpose. Apart from giving a platform for critics to voice their opinions, the reviews also gave recommendations on which books to purchase and so created a secondary source of income for Amazon.com. There was however a flip side to this apparent success. On the one hand it gave access to criticism to large numbers of people who were"," Do-it-yourself literary criticism consisted in writing critical reviews on books published by other authors. What started out as an activity for the elite of the Internet generation however quickly spread through the Internet like a virus. By the time this narrative concludes online literary criticism was already firmly rooted in modern culture. From an elite art form into a popular pastime for anyone who wanted to test their critical skills.

"," By now it was possible to analyze books written by authors from many different backgrounds and from anywhere in the world. To do this needed the technical know-how to install an appropriate software. This was provided by software companies such as MacroMagic from Australia or Texthelp in the UK. Some software provided tables for the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale. These helped with the classification of texts. The user would fill in the required text and the corresponding grade for the three criteria for sentences, words and syllables would appear. The software also provided a list of words that tend to occur often together and it helped to group similar words in headings. In the first year of literary criticism many pioneers used the software provided by the software companies mentioned above. In the following years freeware and shareware was also widely used. Even the internet contained many articles which could be used for criticism. However due to copyrights and license agreements only the text and not the visual images could be used. For example the sentence ""... the sentences were often syntactically incorrect."" could only be reproduced in the software. To make literary criticism more accessible, especially for beginners it also became possible to produce automated literary criticism. In this way text were analyzed for words, sentences and syllables that were relevant to certain keywords. This was done by taking text from the internet or other texts and putting it through a software which groups words by similarity. Afterwards those groups of words were compared to the keywords to see if"," Amazon’s vast selection of books and cheap postage made this an attractive proposition for anyone interested in what their competitors were writing. It didn’t take long for the early critics to realise that they had discovered the democratic mechanism for the first time in history. New authors and old were able to offer their views on any book that was published without restrictions. The result was a flood of critical writings in different genres and languages. Some of the most influential voices in the field emerged from this virtual environment. This trend continues with the establishment of dedicated websites for authors of popular science, sociology, religion etc. Open access has definitely brought about the democratisation of literature in the Internet Age. Nevertheless even if open access was the initial goal then do-it-yourself literary criticism still seems to be a harmless pastime rather than criticism as a profession. There was one significant difference though. The new wave of critics were not able to cite any books or authors to justify their views. In some cases the writings were clearly fraudulent. It was not long before online databases were established to weed out the cranks from the real critics. However this still didn’t prevent many legitimate but obscure authors being associated with their works in ways which made them seem much more famous than they actually were. The emergence of open criticism is undoubtedly a step forward.  

However from a professional literary criticism point of view the quality of the written work and the variety of opinions expressed are not very satisfying. There are at"

Mui was less than impressed with her in-laws. This was partly because she wasn’t happy about Lily driving the car.

At 7 am Lily joined her sisters at the breakfast table, where they ate a hearty meal of rice porridge, milk and eggs. Lily declared that she wanted to do some more practising driving the car. ‘I know where we can find some gravel if you’re not up to it,’ Mui told her. Lily agreed but would need a nap first. After lunch, Lily returned to practising driving the car, but this time, Mui asked her to hold the steering wheel with both hands.

A few hours later, Lily still had not returned. ‘She probably went to the","

The sisters were surprised and proud of their brother-in-law for this new found freedom and ability. It was the first moment that they considered him in that light rather than as their subordinate. He now clearly had feelings for their sister, Lily. He would look at her and give her knowing looks, a look that said ‘I’m not going to lose you to Chen but I have high hopes for us in the future’.

Chen’s control of the sisters’ lives seemed to be slipping further with each passing day. One day he would plan the meals and the activities for the sisters and the next, without warning, he would change the activity or the planned meal as though it were his idea. Lily was also finding it more difficult to convince Chen to drive her, as often as she wanted to. They both grew more suspicious of each other, more frustrated and angry with each other, and Lily had the first signs of panic attacks when she thought Chen was not looking.

The sisters had not seen their brother-in-law so exuberant or so enthusiastic about his work in a long time and they were worried about him. His behaviour was changing and they were getting frustrated and worried. They considered whether it was time to separate from Chen and go back to living with their parents, to which Lily was strongly resistant as she had grown fond of her sisters and her brothers-in-law.

One day, one of the sisters decided it was"," ‘I think we can go for a drive tomorrow Lily after breakfast, OK?’

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale measures a text’s difficulty across three dimensions.  

The first dimension is the total number of words in the text, with longer textes generally being harder to understand.

The second dimension is the number of sentences in the text. Again, the number of sentences in a text affects its readability.

The third dimension is the number of syllables in the text.  A more complex sentence contains more syllables which in turn affects readability.

Thus, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale gives an overall measure of a text’s difficulty. 
Note: This scale is not meant to replace human judgement of readability. 

For the total words:  The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is 0.4. 

For the total sentences:  The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is 2.6.  (This would be the total number of sentences divided by the number of words in the sentence.)

For the total syllables:  The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is 4.4.  (This would be the number of syllables in a words plus the number of syllables in the words plus the number of words in the sentence divided by the total number of words in the sentence.)

Note:"," 

The sisters learnt the secret only when they were packing to leave for their new home. They had a final goodbye sleep before going to the airport on the Friday afternoon. On the Sunday afternoon, after a leisurely lunch at home, they put on their cycling gear and went for a drive to the local allotments. They had bought Lily’s tiny pink bicycle for the outing. As they arrived at the allotments, Lily put down her bicycle and looked around for Chen. She could not see him and wondered where he could be. She was concerned, she did not want to spoil the day. As she walked around, she saw a lady sitting on a bench. It was Mrs. Chiu, the lady who lived across the road. She said, ""Hello Lily, what brings you here?"". Lily said, “Nothing” and kept looking around. Mrs. Chiu took this as a ""no"" and went to get a pen and paper so that she could tell her that she was thinking about selling her house and that she wanted to go through the papers. She then took a look at Lily’s bicycle and said, “Would you like to buy it?”. She handed Lily the paper with the price for the bicycle. Lily read the price and was shocked that it was even close to the cost of the new minivan that Mrs. Chiu had recently purchased. She was about to say no. It dawned on her that they might need"
" I wanted to tell the old timer that these boots were too big, too big for my size 10 feet. No matter the old timer yelled “Get em’, they'll look good on you."" I replied “I’ll pass.” 

I'm standing in my $800 boots on the rocks of a formation in the Arizona desert.  No, they are not working. No, the boots are not cool. Maybe they do look good on me...but I’m not a cowboy.


The Old Timer: They’ll look good on you, but you won’t be a cowboy with them on.

The New Bootswearer: I’ll pass.

TL;DR: It's a heist!


The Problem with Heists

Heists are all around us. Whether it’s a simple heist movie like Snatch where British thief Colin Farrell gets away with millions or a television series like The Man in the High Castle, where a group of Japanese soldiers, Nazi officers and American officers all compete to get their hands on the golden compass that can save their world. The premise is the same. A group of people or organizations with different agendas try to take something from a safe location, usually a vault or a safe deposit box, but often a large amount of money is at stake and the criminals have to work in concert to succeed.


While most heists have four main characters, each with"," 
The boots did not hurt. But neither did the rocky outcropping. I'm not sure how they helped either. 

The whole experience was fun and exciting. But not quite right. So I decided to go to a local shoe repair and try on some cheaper boots that I had had in storage for years and years. I felt more at home. I was able to enjoy the evening and dinner and all the good stuff, the women and beer. And I didn’t feel like a complete fool. 

Talking Boots - TBTL Boots 

Boots talk. You really need to get them out of the closet. 

Boots talk about you. You look and feel like a million bucks and the shoes might as well be the same. The talk creates a positive bias around the product. 

Boots talk about the environment. You buy eco-friendly shoes and the talk can even increase sales if you are promoting a brand. 

The talk creates a positive bias around the product. 

In this Talking Boots unit you will learn:
1.  Why boots talk
2.  How to get your boots out of the closet
3.  How to use your positive talk to boost your brand


## Talking Boots - TBTL Boots

It's time to get Talking Boots! Talking boots are great for building a positive mindset around a product. This can help","  The outfit was not for me. Not even remotely. 

Instead I jumped off the rocks on two feet and removed the $800 high tops. This was a learning moment for me. I had to admit that it was just too expensive. I put on the $80 sneakers and went back to Denver with boots that were now just a pair of sneakers by the time I got to the airport. 

The point is that even though I had spent thousands of dollars on these truly beautiful boots that were going to keep me comfortable for hours after I put them on, I made a learning moment. I went through all these emotions. The highs and lows that we all experience in our personal life when something significant happens to us. I have to admit I didn’t like the highs very much. I felt like a total wimp in them. In all my life I have never bought any piece of clothing that I don’t actually wear, so I didn’t like the idea of throwing them out either.  

But most importantly, I learned that this wasn’t for me. At all.  I was going to have to admit that I’m not a cowboy. And this would be a constant struggle of mine in my life of personal discovery. I will have boots that I like, and love, but I will have to admit that I am not a cowboy. This is how we learn. And I learned I love spending"," What was I thinking? 

Let’s examine the text:

Standing in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand

This statement is an introductory sentence to a paragraph about the author’s experience with her expensive cowboy boots. In this context, the use of the phrase “800-dollar-each” is meant to convey how expensive the boots are.

I stood in my expensive cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand

The second sentence discusses the boots, their expense, and the context of where the author was standing. The adjective “expensive” is used to describe the boots.

	I squinted info the morning sun looking out at the Arizona mountains and I had to admit I was not at home on the range 

The last sentence is the author's conclusion following her initial assessment of her circumstances.

	I was not at home on the range

	I wasn't at home on the range. This can be rephrased as “I wasn’t a cowboy”.

	I wasn’t at home on the range because I wasn’t a cowboy.

	I wasn’t at home on the range because I wasn’t a cowboy because I wasn’t a cowboy in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old"," 

A 2 for boots! It was so much fun to dress up and feel cowboyish. My boots were truly amazing. They even fit me right - which is hard to believe for a pair of these beautiful but very expensive high-tech boots. I walked around the desert all day long looking for someplace to camp for the night and when I found a rock formation that looked out over the desert I made my camp here. I loved being a true cowboy. It was an experience that will remain with me for the rest of my days.

And this brings us to point A. It was the most awesome experience ever. My boots really helped. When you're feeling down I hope you have a pair of these at least.


CEFR level 2: Very high quality


And here is where the fun begins! This time we are going to talk about what a CEFR level 2 actually means. It’s quite an achievement to move up from level 1 and beyond. A CEFR certificate is a good way to prove that you have been to prestigious educational institutions like the University of Oxford (MBA), Harvard Business School (MBA), and HEC Paris (Executive MBA), in addition to institutions like INSEAD, IMD, UC Berkeley, UC Berkeley extension, and Stanford Graduate School of Business, all of which are recognized by many universities and companies all over the world.


“What is a CEFR?”

At"," But I was not a cowhand, so I wore the boots like I was. I thought I looked just the cowboy to get the job done at the moment. I was not ready for that outfit and I think I had the boots because the job was not right and a cowhand didn't need the expense. It was a fail as I had the boots and it was a fail as the job was not right. The boots were too much cowboy too little job. I looked at the rocks looking down at my big cowboy boots. They sure looked expensive and the whole outfit felt like more than I had planned for. I could feel that too. But it was going well. I was flying over the rocks and out into the desert, but I was not a cowhand. I was still thinking about the expensive boots. But it was going well, I was in the desert. I flew low over the rocks and across the wash where I could see the bottom, and the bottom was good. I was good to go, but I still wasn't a cowhand.  The boots were still there. They were my cowboy boots. I wasn’t a cowhand. They were good and looked expensive and maybe I would get the job done later. I tried to look cool and cowboy but I was not ready for this. I had the boots and the job. They were going well until I was in the wash. 

This passage consists of 2400 total"," I wanted a real horse for my money. No offense. The boots were good. Not exactly custom but good. I was not exactly a horse but I could feel my horse in the boots. And that might have been the issue. I was not a horse. But I was feeling like a horse. It’s not every day you feel like a horse.  So I put on my 2-point Stetson. Told the boots it was ok.  They knew it was ok. Said bye to my girl Betty in her black dress.  I took one look at the hat, jumped in my car and blew her away. I was feeling like a horse.

" For many indigenous Australians birds have a close relationship with the earth and the land. They are believed to have a deep understanding of the environment and can speak words of wisdom for humans to listen to. Bird tracking data supports this view, with a wide range of birds appearing to follow the direction of human activities and speak out warnings and instructions to humans. So in my mind, as the wren continues to chirp, it might be telling me not to forget the wisdom of the land and heed the words of this poor lost bird. 

However I am keenly aware that in many parts of the world birds are often killed for their feathers and their voices are used in human entertainment. While humans have always danced to the tune of birds, it feels especially cruel to evict a wren from its native environment to become a house pet. 

I go onto Twitter to find out more. The hashtag #LoveTheFearTheWorshipTheHumanism has trended worldwide with thousands of retweets and likes. I learn that many indigenous cultures have strong links with birds and believe they can speak to humans. I'm reminded of the wise words of Tonto, the crow in The Lone Ranger, and promise to learn more.


This story reminds me of a quote attributed to Albert Einstein that goes something like ""What I cannot create, I fear."" While this sentiment may be true in some regards, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of humans fearing birds. Birds have"," Birds have long been considered to have no capacity for abstract thought. Yet the wren's behaviour in bouncing its bump bump bump against the glass is so similar to humans bouncing ideas around in their heads, it's tempting to conclude that birds can think like humans do. It could be coincidence but there is more than a hint that the wren has something to tell me. A school in Massachusetts held a trivia night recently and there was a buzz around a little brown bird that appeared to be a wren but wasn't. When asked what it was the child exclaimed 'a wren! It's a wren!', prompting a round of stunned silence around the table. What does it all mean? Some say it's a sign from the universe. Some say it's just a coincidence. The answer I've come to believe actually lies somewhere in between. Birds have long been considered to have no capacity for abstract thought. Yet the wren's behaviour in bouncing its bump bump bump against the glass is so similar to humans bouncing ideas around in their heads, it's tempting to conclude that birds can think like humans do. It could be coincidence but there is more than a hint that the wren has something to tell me. 

Based on this passage, the wren seems to be signalling a message from the human culture that it's ""tempting"" to think it has the capacity to think like humans do. Evans gives several examples of how people interpreted the wren's behaviour during"," Birds are nature's messengers, constantly communicating the state of the natural world around us. From the tiniest insect to the loudest symphony of birdsong, they are continually sending and receiving the sounds of the natural world. They are the first to see new species, the last to hear old ones, the first to taste the nectar of the summer, and the first to take flight in winter. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Aztecs, Incas, Azande, and ancient Hebrews all worshipped birds for their abilities to communicate with the natural world around them. The Egyptians even made a small bird of clay to represent Ra, the god of the sun, and used it to foretell the weather. They used birds to predict the harvest, to communicate when crops needed to be tended, to find mates and to send distress signals when there was danger near at hand.  

But now as the planet gets warmer and wetter birds get displaced, birds like this wren are on the move. They are migrating to more southwesterly climes to spend the winter. 

But the wren doesn't speak for humans. We are becoming less hospitable to birds. There is evidence to support this. In North America the human population is associated with a drop in bird populations. While there are many reasons for this, one of them may be due to the increase in bird strikes from vehicles. In response to this the U"," Who knows what kind of message the wren is trying to send. But as Paul Evans notes it is possible to interpret the wren's behavior in a host of ways. Some believe the wren is signaling it's mating season. Others think the wren is expressing hope that spring will soon return. Still others believe the wren might just be confused. All things considered the wren's behavior is not really all that unusual. In fact there's a famous quote that goes like this: Birds and animals in general are complex beasts that display a variety of interesting behaviors. Their complexity challenges and fascinates biologists and other scientists alike. We can learn a lot from birds just like we can learn from animals in general. And it is our responsibility to study them fully and give them the critical thought they deserve. It is also important to remember that as biologists we are dealing with a species that has the power to kill us. So, I conclude, just as we must respect and learn from animals in general we must also respect and learn from birds. Let's not forget though that although there is much we can learn from the bird world around us, the bird world isn't really interested in hearing what we are thinking and might just as well be silent. 

Write a prediction about Paul Evans's opinion regarding birds and animals in general.

	Paul Evans does not believe that birds are intelligent. He cites research that shows that birdsong is learned through experience. He also cites research which", It is true that we humans have long viewed birds in a negative light. We think of them as messy animals without feelings or dignity or rationality. The Romans decimated entire bird populations. We hunted them down and ate them. In the 1500s many English believed that witches had wings and could fly. So the bird of warning was shunned and many people lived in terror of loosing their mind. But also true is the bird is a messenger. It has come to announce a storm that will bring destruction to the greenhouse where it has spent the night. The storm is from the greenhouse itself: carbon emissions. Plants need oxygen to grow so we humans have been chipping away at that habitat of the birds for years. And now the greenhouse is bursting it must release some of the building blocks that make it what it is. It is these things that the wren is trying to alert us to. The wren may be a poor messenger. But it is true to say that all living things on the earth have come to rely on these gases for the very air we breathe. Maybe we humans should be a little more kind. Instead of treating each other with hatred and distrust maybe we should be giving and offering compassion and respect. Perhaps the wren is simply trying to remind us that birds too can create beauty and joy. And that to destroy that would be a great act of cruelty. Maybe we humans should be a little kinder to the wren and the other living creatures with which we," Some say that the bird's appearance is significant and forebodes something to come. The bird looks small, frail, and vulnerable, it might be signalling that we need to look after it, bring it in, and give it better conditions. Others say that it doesn't matter how small or vulnerable the bird is as long as it's got a will of steel and has a few tricks up its sleeve.

Some birds, however, are notoriously bad luck birds. They're considered unlucky in many cultures and the sight of them is often considered a portent of misfortune. The swallow is the archetypal bad luck bird as it's the bird that invented the ball sport known as soccer. And it doesn't stop there. In Ancient Greece swallows were often represented in art wearing their own small shields to protect themselves against any danger. You know the story. These days we tend to look upon swallows as beneficial bird that's linked to new beginnings, prosperity, renewal and change.

Whether it's a wren or a swallow that's spotted in our greenhouse it's unlikely to be good. The birds have got it all wrong. It seems that we have it all wrong. If you want to see what you might be missing this spring watch out for these birds, they might give you a clue, they might just tell you that we need to make some changes, they might just tell you that we need to do some growing up. After all there is"," We are surrounded by birds every day: crows banging the windows of high rise buildings doves cawing as they ride the wind seabirds soaring over the Atlantic wind turbines whirring on top of tall buildings. There is a large amount of information about birds in our culture, but that information is scattered. We have a word for every behaviour birds have learned about us from human culture, but most of it is just the tip of the bird. There is so much more to say about birds and it is time we listened.  A2 text mentions bird as a warning sign, a bird of augury and divination, and a poor bird stuck in a greenhouse. Text provides some examples to support its claims, but limited number of information points are also used. Bird is assessed as A2 level.

Birds are symbols of peace, harmony and life, which makes them attractive to humans. They are source of food for humans, provide natural protection and make interesting pets. The culture has a lot of knowledge about birds and they have learned about different human behaviours and have developed complex rituals and practices related to them. These practices can be seen in religious celebrations, celebrations, festivals and parades. They have a word for every behaviour birds have observed, but a lot of it is just the tip of the bird.  There is a large amount of information about birds in our culture, but that information is scattered. We have a word for every behaviour birds have learned"
" That boy’s mother was so enchanted by Joanna’s performance that she burst into tears and promptly sent an email to Joanna signed by a middle name: Emily. 

While this does not prove Emily’s profession, we can safely assume that she earns her keep as a concert pianist. 

Joanna’s Piano Methodology When Emily sent that email, Joanna was in the midst of writing her most ambitious book yet. She has since retired her concert platform and instead has become fixated on teaching children to play the piano. Why? Because Joanna has realised that most children are, quite simply, tone deaf. This might sound an unusual conclusion to reach for a child’s educational programme. The only child I know who is not tone deaf is the Queen of England. But that is a topic for another time. 

As with so many other human endeavours, there is some degree of evidence to support Joanna’s belief that most children are not capable of hearing the nuances of music notation, nor can they perform to the levels of musical excitement demanded by most contemporary music. While the latter is debatable, the former is a well established fact. 

The first edition of Joanna’s Piano Methodology was released in 2013. This is where she defines the problem as “tone deafness” and begins to lay out her prescription for how to teach children how to play the piano. One of the first steps"," That boy grew up to become a concert pianist of his own. This is certainly a great story about an inspiration inspiring the next generation of musicians. And it fits perfectly within a unit on themes andvariations, as it develops a thematic concept around the idea of musical inspiration and the concept of improvisation. The example of the boy at the concert can be used in a number of ways:

First, it can be presented in a biographical format that highlights Joanna’s career so far and connects it with the current book. You could present Joanna performing, a clearly engaged child in the front row; the crowd roaring their approval, Joanna reaching for the notes with energy and precision; then a boy in his early childhood asking Joanna for advice on how to play the notes he was hearing, and Joanna improvising a short variation on a well-known piece in order to help him master the piece.

Second, you could use the boy as an opportunity to explore the idea of musical inspiration through a range of examples from well-known music.

Third, the boy could be featured as the main character in the story. This would allow you to explore several plot lines relating to the idea of musical inspiration: the character’s journey towards becoming a professional musician, the idea of musical inspiration as the link between performer and piece, and the idea of a piece inspiring a musician to play.

In addition, the unit would be"," As she concluded her recital Joanna saw the boy reach for the notes in a way that left her speechless. She was so moved that she bought a copy of the score for the boy and within weeks he was having lessons at her home. It soon became clear that the boy was completely beguiled by the music, but to his parents he seemed simply overwhelmed by his newfound ability. He told them he had never experienced lessons like these before. They were stunned at his revelation but thrilled at the same time. Now their lives are enriched by the knowledge that they contributed to this remarkable child’s experience of music.   Joanna MacGregor is one of the most famous piano players in the world.  Her YouTube channel has millions of views and she has toured widely, but her life’s work is to educate the next generation of piano players through writing books for young children learning the piano. Joanna is passionate about music education and the power of music to enhance the lives of those who experience it. 

Joanna’s story is not unique. Virtually every famous pianist and musician has written books for young children learning the piano to share their love of music with the next generation. It is one way of keeping the art live and accessible. Music is an innate part of human biology and cannot be separated from the human brain or the human body. It would be a shame to let it wither in obscurity. Joanna’s book will have a"," His parents tell Joanna that despite their son’s rapturous appreciation of her music, he can’t name any of Joanna’s compositions. To that Joanna has a solution. Since there is a lot Joanna doesn’t know about music, she has organized a series of seminars that will teach music to children who lack the vocabulary to describe it. After all what good is music if you can’t explain it? 

Joanna has set up three levels of seminars to suit all ages. The first is for adults who want to learn music to share with children. The second is for children who, despite their best efforts to the contrary, cannot talk about music. It seems this little boy has slipped through the net. Joanna has arranged for him to attend her piano class. The last level is for children who, when asked to name a particular piece of music, respond with something vague like a song title or a composer’s initial. Joanna would like to attract these children to the seminars, though she isn’t sure how to go about it. Could some of these musical “mythbusters” be reached through modern day technology? Might a YouTube video, a smart phone app, or even an interactive whiteboard be of assistance? 

After setting these strategies in motion Joanna is preparing for the next seminar. But her mind keeps returning to the current one. After all this is hardly a surprise. Despite Joanna’s"," It was that she was there at all!

Joanna grew up in a musical family and started playing the piano at three years old. By five Joanna was playing with professional orchestras as a soloist. Joanna’s journey continues today as a professor at McGill University, the recipient of a Canada Council for the Arts/Giraud-Hollweg Young Artist Award, a founding member of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra’s National Youth Orchestra, and a regular guest artist with orchestras around the world.

Joanna’s journey brings us to the present moment. But how does she hope to pass the time with the piano? She has turned her focus to teaching young children piano. Joanna, who started teaching at the age of 11, believes children can grasp the essentials of playing the piano from an early age. That’s why she has written four books for the young pianist:

Toddler’s Piano Lessons: Simple Songs and Rags to Rock Your Baby’s Baby (Penguin, 2008)

Pre-School Piano Lessons: Discovering the Piano Keys and the Music they Sing (Penguin, 2010)

Toddler’s Piano Books: Five Songs and Games for Young Children (Penguin, 2013)

Learning Through Playing: Young Children’s Piano Books by Joanna MacGregor (Bloomsbury USA, 2015)

"," He was transfixed by the way she looked at the keyboard, as if the music were not there and only she was present in the room, performing. As one critic observed, she had “captured the complete joy of music-making in all its wondrous complexity.” If any human has the capacity to create in that way, it is Joanna MacGregor. But while her command of the piano may border on the mystical, her command of words shines through. Here are some lines from the recent books she has written for children: Joanna set down her pencil and focused her attention on the keyboard.

Then the music began. As the notes rapped out of the piano, Joanna felt her heart race. This is what she had been looking for all her life—the ability to write music of a similar complexity.

And her fingers flew as she played her heart out. What a thrill to finally know a complete piece of music after years of playing by ear. She has devoted most of her adult life to the piano, and in that time she has gathered an incredible treasure trove of music. Some of it is performed by living composers. The other music, she has transcribed and arranged, sometimes adding improvised embellishments. But even her most spontaneous embellishments are in service of the music. 

After the piece ended, Joanna was still elated. “Wow, that was amazing!” she exclaimed. The audience murmured"," At that particular concert Joanna performed a piece she co-wrote for children. 

“When you are a kid, you don't care about anything” is the subtitle of Joanna’s upcoming book for kids. This phrase sums up Joanna’s approach to parenting a child. The book is meant to be an enjoyable read for kids where Joanna recounts the stories of her childhood. Somewhat tongue in cheek, Joanna attempts to trace the genesis of some of the quotes she uses in her writings. While the book is written in the first person, Joanna uses references to back up her claims. Even at the age of nine, Joanna is very much aware that she does not look like her mother. Her father’s a bus driver so he must have been quite fit as a fiddle, Joanna thinks to herself. Joanna’s father worked a full-time job and was often absent. In those days children were cared for by their mothers. So while Joanna had a fairly permissive upbringing, at the same time she also had very much a self-sufficient child. Joanna adds that “self-sufficient” to the phrase “When you are a kid, you don't care about anything”! 

Joanna acknowledges that while writing this book for children was a great idea, the actual execution has been far less than ideal. Not just because of the enormous number of edits she had to go through to ensure the book"

The Redundancy of Dialogue 
In most fiction the dialogue is written by a professional. The skill and the art of reading text from a distance of several feet and at an angle and in light of surrounding text is a highly refined skill requiring years of training. For this reason the dialogue of books, films and television is written conservatively. To ensure that the spoken text does not exceed a certain number of words. The reduction condensation and deletion of dialogue described above is therefore a useful process. One which I personally found very useful.

The Redundancy of Narrative Description 
Film narrative is largely a description of actions. It is impossible to observe these actions without also knowing something about the people involved. In a novel the reader gets to know the characters through a prolonged description of their physical appearance, emotional state and their interactions with each other and with other characters. In film this type of narrative description is often redundant. The action that is being described is often so familiar to the spectator that most of this description will be available in their subconscious. The narrative therefore reduces itself to what can be observed. This is an advantage to the spectator as it allows them to perceive what is actually happening with more ease. In this way the spectator will be able to observe a wider spectrum of actions and reactions. It is a subtle and often understated advantage to film narrative.

The Redundancy of Narrative In-between the Lines 
"," Film, being a visual medium, requires an immediate and heightened level of attention from its audience. In order to deliver that kind of attention and impact in a limited amount of time a screenwriter needs to keep the viewer engaged to the point of exhaustion. What will the character say next? What just happened? Why did it just happened? This requires a much higher level of abstraction and generalisation than what is possible in the writing of dialogue for film. Therefore the writer needs to be able to reduce the narrative to essentials, to a core that retains the essential elements while giving the audience the required information at the required time.

In the case of a novel or a short story this is a matter of cutting extraneous words, phrases and sentences to a minimum. I find this to be particularly helpful in spotting redundancies of adverbs, adjectives and nouns. It is useful to identify adverbs in phrases such as ‘very’ and ‘rather’ as they have identical functions. Adverbs describe the quality of an adjective or a verb which is expressed using the word that follows it, for example ‘very tall’ and ‘rather handsome’. Adjectives such as ‘very’ and ‘rather’ can be combined to form comparative adjectives which express degree of something using the word that follows it, for example ‘rather tall than this’ and ‘very handsome compared to the rest’. 

Nouns such as ‘very’ and ‘rather"," 
The novel I was reading was the recent A Very Private Practice by Phillip Pullman. The protagonist is Dr. Swaraj Murti who has returned to India from England in the early 1970s to find that the practice that he and his wife founded is flourishing due to the practice of Indian medicine. But now Swaraj has no involvement in the day to day running of the practice. He feels trapped and yearns for the freedom to practice medicine as he sees fit. He has built an identity in England in terms of his practice but now feels that he has been disoriented and lost in India. The narrative of this novel, as I was reducing and condensing the dialogue and description, revealed this to me in a way that was unexpected and enjoyable. 
I was struck by how much of the dialogue and description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs. 
The novel I was reading was the recent A Very Private Practice by Phillip Pullman. The protagonist is Dr. Swaraj Murti who has returned to India from England in the early 1970s to find that the practice that he and his wife founded is flourishing due to the practice of Indian medicine. But"," I am not an expert on the novel but here are a few observations about the film version of the story I’m adapting for television:

1. Every Picture Tells a Story is filmed almost entirely in black and white and is a very scenic movie. It features beautiful country homes with many large rooms and acres of lawn, drenched with natural light. I can see how in a black and white film every shot might be required to have some redundancy, to show rather than show only.

2. Every Picture Tells a Story was originally published in 1932 and is a historical novel of the late 1800s. It has extensive descriptions of how people lived and worked in and around various country homes. Although the novel is set in a fictionalized version of the late 1800s I wondered if the necessity to show rather than tell in some of the descriptions might not have limited how much could be shown. Would it not be difficult to show a great deal with only a little narration? And, if so, perhaps the desire to show rather than tell in some of these scenes could account for the excessive amounts of lawn, lawn furniture and flowers shown, which is abundant.

3. In adapting this book into a script for television I’ve been struck by the narrative economy inherent in describing in detail what people do in other people’s houses, yet not requiring the audience to witness these same things in person. Instead I can describe a great many activities but then show rather than","

In film dialogue and description take up space. They are not meant to be reduced. They are meant to be understood. Film often requires scenes to run for hours, interspersed with multiple rewatches to make their fullest impact. Film is a medium of speed, tension and surprise, requiring that the spectator's attention be kept fully engaged.

In contrast books, even novels, do not have the luxury of taking their time to engage the spectator's mind. Their main aim is not to keep the reader's attention but to get the point across through the characters' interactions. Dialogue and description here are like superfluous ornamentation. They need to be removed in order to focus on what is truly important in the scene, the people and the plot.

In one of my favorite novels, One Hundred Years of Solitude, the main characters Juan Ruiz-Cabrillo, who goes by ""Quicho,"" and his son ""Don Jorge,"" visit their aunt Doña Marta in a little town called ""El Malpais,"" which translates to the ""Wicked Place"" in English. The Malpais cliffside cemetery is a frequent scene of plot development and even more frequently of death and disaster. The novel opens with the death of ""Don Jorge's"" father and mother, who had just returned from church. Quicho and Don Jorge rush to the scene to collect the last few precious mementos of his"," 
Narrative demands that the audience's attention:

When we want to focus our attention on something, we naturally orient our visual system towards that thing. The human eye has six degrees of spatial resolution. This means that it can easily track the movements of a person's eyes or the appearance and disappearance of something from view in order to keep track of its position and trajectory. We don't have equivalent levels of visual resolution when reading a book. A reader is not able to focus their visual attention in the same way that we are able to focus our eyes on an object of interest and track its movements. So what that book presents us with is a lot of redundancy. It is hard to read without also seeing and hearing what comes before and after what is of interest to you. 
What we don't need is redundant. 
This is particularly true of dialogue because dialogue is a form of indirect communication which requires the audience to infer what is being said rather than hearing it spoken directly. Dialogue does not make explicit claims about the world. The audience has to actively make those claims themselves, so a lot of what the dialogue does is describe what happened already or is saying that something will happen. When redundant dialogue or narrative description comes, it tells you nothing. It may as well be absent. So when writers are editing a script down to its simplest form, what they should eliminate is not words and phrases that carry their meaning but those that would be redundant in describing what has"," 

Redundancy of the dialogue type is what enables the audience to follow what is being said. Dialogue often exists to assist the narrative by bringing a character to do something or express a sentiment. A scene in a film without any dialogue between characters would have the same function but would likely be perceived as much less interesting to the audience. This does not mean every dialogue scene is redundant but that dialogue exists and can serve a purpose in the overall narrative of a film.

Redundancy of the narrative type is what enables the audience to focus on what is going on. In most films narrative is conveyed primarily through descriptions of what is seen on screen. As much as possible the description of a scene or action should communicate the action visually. If there is redundant description of a scene this is fine but the redundant description should still be able to communicate what is going on. 

Here are some scenes from a novel that I was able to reduce while still conveying the main message. Some of them have no dialogue between characters.

One evening, as it grew dark, they gathered at a river in the forest.  They were silent in that beautiful place, and it seemed to Fanny that the quiet of the day had passed into the still air.  They walked slowly along the riverbank.  In the distance one could hear a waterfall, and the light of the fire played upon the rippling surface of the river.

" However our ability to do so will be impacted by rising temperatures. The impact on humans will be most acute as heat waves will be more frequent and last longer. The threat of intense heat in some parts of the world has already caused mass migrations and famines. The combination of a hotter climate with already stressed and overpopulated areas could result in devastating humanitarian situations and will most likely prompt the international community to implement tougher measures to limit climate change.

The climate in 2023 is as follows: the Earth is warmer and drier than it has been over the last century. Over time, this could have a variety of effects on our planet's ecosystems and biodiversity. These effects may be positive or negative, but one thing is certain: human life on Earth is more intertwined with nature than ever before.

The article has a number of inaccuracies. In particular:

The article states that humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage. This is not entirely accurate as humans have exploited all the resources available to them without taking full advantage of the land and natural resources.

The author also says that 'overpopulation' will be an issue, but it is difficult to conclude anything from a single graph.

The quote says that 'overloaded with 6 billion members of the human race', however the article says that this quote was taken out of context.

The author talks about the impacts of climate change on humans and on ecosystems and biodiversity. In"," This has lead to the development of industries based on fossil fuels which are carbon intensive. If they were to suddenly stop to exist we would quickly find ourselves without energy sources which enable our modern way of life. This would most likely result in famines or wars over food and resources as people would not be able to feed themselves. Climate change is therefore likely to have profound repercussions for all our lives.  

The following are some of the consequences of global warming:  

 warmer weather which leads to more extreme weather patterns causing more droughts and flooding
 more frequent and more violent storms and flooding
 plant and animal extinctions which will lead to a decline in the populations of plants and animals
 shorter, more intense, and more frequent heat waves

There are many solutions to global warming including reducing the amount of carbon that is emitted into the atmosphere but there is also the need to also change human behaviour as changing energy consumption will be difficult if people are not convinced that the changes will affect them personally. This may require changes in personal lifestyle such as reducing meat consumption and promoting vegetarian diets. It is possible that the environmental changes we have wrought will have a significant impact on human behaviour which could be challenging to change, however, in the longer term will be likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and aid in the recovery of a warming planet.

"," But if our ability to take advantage of natural resources declines as a result of global warming we will face some difficult choices. These choices will need to be made and they will need to be made quickly. In this respect global warming could be called an opportunity. It could give us the chance to look at our consumption patterns with fresh eyes and to rethink the way we live and the resources we rely upon. But only if we move quickly. Only if we take effective action now. The following actions could have a significant effect on global warming: reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from the transportation sector, reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the electricity generation sector, increasing reliance on renewable energy sources.  All of us could do our bit by conserving energy, reducing our reliance on vehicles which rely on fuel combustion and purchasing electric vehicles. These measures will not be sufficient on their own to tackle global warming, rather they will make our lives easier and will reduce our ecological footprints. But if we work together we could turn this into a challenge that will push us to do things we haven’t thought of yet. We could pool our purchasing power and demand that businesses within our communities share the benefits of their economic growth. We could insist that public buildings are more energy efficient and consider renewable energy sources for our electricity. We could encourage our governments to take ambitious steps to cut emissions. In doing so we could benefit from economies of scale and innovation.  We could work together to reduce emissions. That"," We know we have a finite resource however and if we use this finite resource irresponsibly the price we will pay in the form of more volatile weather events and of course a loss of biodiversity. We can already see this with the extreme weather events of the last few years and with more unpredictable weather likely to come our quality of life will suffer and we may even experience more catastrophes. We cannot afford to keep burning fossil fuels which are the cause of global warming. We need to make dramatic changes to our ways of living and to curb carbon emissions we will need to invest in renewable technologies which are already available. We will no longer be able to rely on fossil fuels and there is a limit to the amount of carbon dioxide we can pump into the atmosphere. Global warming must be halted. 

The word “heat” in this text is an example of a visual aid to make the meaning of the text clearer. This can be done by using bold print or underline to highlight key words or phrases. 

The next time you see “heat is on” substitute with “global warming” to make your text even clearer.

"," But with a warmer climate such resources will become less available. Global warming will have consequences for human and environmental well-being spanning across all aspects of our daily lives.

The following is a list of impacts of global warming:

  * warmer temperatures will increase the spread of diseases
  * more violent storms with increased rainfall will lead to coastal flooding
  * more extreme weather events such as droughts and flooding will harm human health and cause greater disruptions to food supply chains
  * warmer temperatures will also increase the energy required to grow and process crops and animals, leading to greater energy and water demands
  * warmer temperatures will reduce the time available to grow trees for our electricity supply and help mitigate carbon emissions

Although many of these impacts will be felt throughout the planet, the exact impact on human beings may differ widely country to country depending on the economic and social context.

  * As the earth gets warmer and more vulnerable to climate change, so also does the earth become more prone to more extreme weather events and natural catastrophes, which lead to a new set of challenges - climate change impacts.

  * These will include more damaging winds, droughts and floods, as well as rising sea levels and more intense cyclones and typhoons.

  * In 2013, one million people were made homeless by extreme flooding and mudslides, caused by the Japan earthquake. And as climate change accelerates such natural disasters are likely to become more frequent and more intense"," A warmer climate will also likely lead to an increase in species, new and stronger kinds of animals, birds and insects. In the future, the world’s population will likely also expand due to a warmer environment and better growing conditions. This means more people to feed and care for and thus more people working in agriculture which is likely to have an impact on wages, supply and demand.

","  A warmer climate though will mean less extreme weather patterns with longer and more frequent hotter days which will inevitably lead to more natural disasters and more heat related deaths. There is also evidence to suggest that with more extreme weather we may see more violent conflict and civil unrest. The future of climate change is something on which there is very strong consensus among scientists and governments. We are likely to live in a warmer world over the next few decades but how much warmer and what will be done to reduce the danger of further climate change remains hotly debated. 

The narrative above supports learners' understanding of A2 level concepts on explicit information, information structure, and limited number of information points. The narrative includes an explanation of global warming and its consequences, a review of how the earth's climate has changed over the last few decades and the current consensus among scientists. There are only 3 paragraphs in the narrative, which is a very limited number of information points.

Below is an extract of the text of the A2 level assessment, in which we can find the same information: 

""The current consensus among scientists suggests that the average earth's temperature will increase by no more than 1 °C to 2 °C (1.8 to 3.6 °F) above pre-industrial levels. There will be greater extremes in the types of weather events we experience and more heat-related deaths. The effects of climate change are seen in a range of areas, including changes to the weather in all"
"

Relating to distance and direction, it is obvious that cartography is the science and art of the representation of such spatial relations through abstract drawings or pictures and is one of the mainstays of human experience since the beginning of civilizations.

In a world where time is almost non-existent, the notion of distances becomes critical and the primary concern of cartographers is to map the relationships between points on the earth’s surface so that the cartographer can make use of them to calculate actual distances between points which in turn give a more accurate assessment of the real distances between places which, for want of a better word, we can term as ‘place’.

The early man, the hominid, a being similar to man but with ape like features, used to hunt and gather in groups and his main activities were those of travel. As a species we do not have a very well developed sense of direction and as a consequence hunting by scent and the direction that a food source presents was of more importance to the hunter than its actual distance. We do not have very accurate measures of distances in those days and for that matter today when we communicate over great distances on mobile phones. With the aid of the map that has been created and the sense of direction that we developed through our hunting and gathering in groups, the hominid is able to locate and travel to sources of food. When the ability to compute actual distances became more important than the sense of direction and that"," Thus with these two dimensions or dimensions plus time as the basis, mapping was invented. 

As humans explore the planet and need to create a baseline map of the planet, there appears to be a need to standardize measures of map dimensions and scales. One way of achieving this is to define a metric called a ‘mile’, which is basically the average distance between a 1 inch by 1 inch grid square and its nearest neighboring grid square at the equator, and the inverse for a 1 mile by 1 mile grid square. Thus the 1 mile by 1 mile grid square equates to 310,656.25 yards at the equator whereas at say London, UK, it would be 1,760 yards. Thus the 1 mile by 1 mile grid square would be 310,656.25 yards at the equator, and 1,760 yards at London, UK.

Since the early modern era in the 17th and 18th centuries the development of the steam engine saw substantial improvements in vehicle technology. It was only after the development of motorized vehicles that it became possible to measure distances in terms of miles per hour and even then these figures were only approximate as the rate of acceleration would also affect these figures. Even so, by the turn of the 20th century the mile was established as the most suitable metric for measuring length on the planet’s surface and it remains so even today.

The most iconic maps today are not of the planet Earth or even of the region of the"," A map was therefore necessarily a two dimensional entity that could present the relationship of points and features with each other to the navigator by means of lines showing the direction and distance between them.  

This enabled the early nomadic hunter-gatherers to follow the herds of animals, the seasonal migrations of birds and fish and hunt from the safety of fixed abodes. Later on, with the advent of agriculture and herding, the necessity for providing these safe fixed abodes became an important consideration.  

Maps were therefore initially pictorial with only one dimensional scale. This made it necessary to rely on the artistic judgement of experienced artists to provide a degree of accuracy. This inevitably led to the production of many, many very similar copies, each providing a slightly different perspective from which to view the world. The copying of these pictorial maps was a major factor in the evolution of script, which was the first system of writing.  

It was the copying of the world map by Ptolemy in the second century AD that initiated the evolution of the more sophisticated idea of a horizontal two dimensional map. These were created by reducing the many identical representations of the earth’s surface to a single line or plane. By providing a method of representing the relationship of points and features on the map with each other, an element of quantitative accuracy was introduced to a system of representation that was already predominantly pictorial.

Maps continued to evolve throughout the later Middle Ages"," This situation changed with the invention of the map which not only displayed the relative distance between features but also accurately represented the direction of travel between them. 

As the story continues, the term “cartographic” has been adopted to describe the process of creating a map, which was previously referred to as “topographical”. This is because a map was originally created in order to communicate information about an area of land to other people; whilst cartography is the process of communicating information to an audience of one, the map is primarily concerned with conveying information about relationships between features of land to those who do not travel over it. This narrative concludes with the introduction of the phrase, “Flesch Kincaid Grade”, which describes a formula that can be used to assess the readability of text for students at key grade levels.

The formula is as follows: Grade X + Flesch Kincaid Grade X. This formula, which stands for “grade reading level X + Flesch Kincaid grade reading level X”, provides a useful summary of the grade level of the material and the grade level that readers will typically be at. For example, a grade level 5 text can be understood by readers of a grade 2 or above. In contrast, a grade 10 text would require readers to have a grade 8 or above level of English literacy to fully understand. The Flesch Kincaid Grade formula is used in the creation of digital material to help ensure it"," This was reflected in the symbols used to represent distances expressed in miles, kms, yds etc. 
However, with the growth of mapping as a profession in the late 19th and early 20th centuries there was a growing interest in the accurate representation of distance both horizontally and vertically on a map. In the early years the symbols that represented distance still used in the previous examples of hours and days but with the introduction of the meter as the unit of distance in the 1930’s, kms, yds, miles, furlongs, chains etc. were adopted and continued to be used into the 21st century. 
Marks The map genre as it evolved in the 20th century can be divided into two periods. The first covers the period after the introduction of the meter as the unit of distance in the 1930’s until the advent of GPS systems. This is known as the Metric Era. The second period covers the rise of GIS (or Geographical Information Systems) from the 1990’s until today with the advent of more accurate and less expensive mapping technology. Today, the map genre has diversified to incorporate this new technology and has become even more accurate and expressive. 
In the first period, the accurate representation of distance on a map was achieved using the symbol kms, miles, yds, furlongs, chains, etc. However, when the meter was adopted in the 1930’s the accuracy of using these symbols was compromised with"," Therefore, the cartographer devised an alternate system of distance by the number of edges or lines which joined the points represented on the map together. The more edges the map had, the greater the expressiveness of the map and the more accurate it became.

In 1817, the Scottish doctor, economist and polymath, Adam Smith, published his famous Wealth of Nations, which was to influence the development of the modern world throughout the nineteenth century.

There are twelve editions of Wealth of Nations published in twelve languages. The first edition appeared in 1776 in London and appeared in two bound volumes. Smith noted that the first edition was so bulky that it could not be carried easily and suggested that one volume be bound and the other distributed and made into five separate books which could be carried easily. One volume was priced at £4, 12 shillings. The first edition of Wealth of Nations sold at auction for £27,250 (over $400,000) in 2007.

The first edition is considered to be Smith's most famous work, and has been praised by many modern economists, and historians, for its originality and for providing a model for considering the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. Smith's second most famous work is the book The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which deals with ethical issues such as empathy and pride in one's country. This book was published six years after the first edition of Wealth of Nations and was well received"," Later on, as map making became an art form and as the use of different media and printing became more developed, an explicit map gave the map-maker more tools to help him/her in depicting the features accurately. The use of descriptive features such as: rivers, lakes, heights, colours, landmarks and natural features helped in representing the features. Maps in the past also contained less pictorial representations of the map contents as they do today. They are simple plans of the earth’s surface, its islands and continents, with coastlines, bodies of water and mountains. In some cases, names of cities, rivers and countries were included to make the map more useful. Many also contain rules or instructions for the use of the map. However there is evidence of considerable planning and detail in the presentation of some maps.  

During the Roman Empire a more developed form of map using a more detailed pictorial representation of the map contents and including names of places was adopted. Mapping of the Roman Empire was continued until the 13th Century AD, when the technology to produce detailed and detailed pictorial maps on a large scale using copper plates was developed. At the time of the Roman Empire, maps often covered large areas of the Earth’s surface and were used for many purposes. These included: navigation of convoys, armies on the march, as an aid to local people to plan their activities and as a form of propaganda.

Sir Ernest Shackleton - British Ice-climber
Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, FBA (14 August 1874 – 20 November 1916) was a British ice and Antarctic explorer, best known for his expedition to Antarctica with four companions in the Endurance in 1903–04.

In 1896, Shackleton became interested in glaciology when his doctor suggested he consider alternative therapies for the family's rheumatic problems. He worked at a school in the South Coast of England before enlisting in the army in 1899. In 1901, he went to the Belgian Congo to investigate claims that Belgian traders were selling African slaves in ivory. From there, he went to New Zealand, becoming fascinated by the country's potential ice industries.

After a visit to New York in 1902, Shackleton went to London and established a company with fellow explorer Robert Falcon Scott, in which Shackleton would take polar expeditions under his leadership. On 3 June 1903, Shackleton and his three companions, John Ball, Edmund Hillary and Edward Wilfred Wilson, set off from South Georgia, with the intention of becoming the first men to reach the South Pole.

They ended up becoming the first Europeans to reach the Antarctic plateau, having reached their goal, via a perilous and extremely dangerous crossing of the barren, cold and storm-"," It is not yet clear how these are being received in Britain but the New York Times reports that 'while Shackleton's expedition is being lionised by the American public, his private life and behaviour continue to be the subject of controversy.'  There are also rumours that the Endurance, which took place more than a century ago and did not involve the exploitation of natural resources, is being used by the American government to promote a controversial programme of deep sea mining. In his youth Shackleton was rumoured to have been a member of a group that carried out 'witchcraft trials'. These trials involved druids conducting human sacrifices to aurochsen - a mythical white horse. While modern aurochsen worship has been outlawed in much of the world, there is still some evidence in the United States for human sacrifice to aurochsen - notably in the state of Montana. It seems possible that Shackleton, who was rumoured to have had some involvement in such 'witchcraft', may have been an aurochsen sacrificeman. In fact Shackleton's personal life and behaviour are as controversial as any that occurred on his doomed Antarctic expedition. Biographies of him are full of contradictory accounts of his youth and suggest he may have undergone psychiatric treatment for depression and paranoia. Shackleton's diaries contain allegations of embezzlement and of the theft of money from a ship's safe. He was reported to have been involved in"," Shackleton is a polar explorer who lived and operated during the first wave of modernity, but he did not start out that way. Born in 1870 into a poor family in Southampton, he was a man of many facets, who initially studied dentistry, and later developed a passionate interest in natural history, which drove him to explore the frozen continent of Antarctica. With little academic experience, he travelled to London to study medicine at St. Thomas' Hospital, but soon abandoned this path in favour of natural history. He worked at the British Museum and also made several expeditions to the Antarctic, on which he travelled in the company of the renowned naturalist Alfred Noyes. These voyages established Shackleton's reputation and led to offers of financial assistance from many prominent Americans, who provided the funds to finance his first expedition. However, Shackleton's journey would not be a success until the discovery of a more powerful, more highly flammable mixture of fuels, called gasoline, on this continent, which was instrumental in providing the means by which he and his crew was able to return safely to their home base. This story can be told from the point of view of multiple people: Shackleton's, the Endurance's, the Endurance's biographers', and the Museum of Natural History's. Shackleton's experiences during the Antarctic expedition are the focal point of the narrative. His experiences on this mission, including the discovery of gasoline and its use in lighting"," The New York Times reports that 'a Shackleton blimp, complete with a model of the Endurance sailing in the Antarctic Sea, floats above New York City'. Shackleton has been embraced as a role model for ambitious executives in the US. 'Shackleton was great in business but he was bad at people', says Jonny Dicker, chief creative officer of a design consultancy in Washington. 'But now we need people who are great at people to take on Shackleton's mantle and do his good work.'

Sir Ernest Shackleton (1874 – 1937)  was a British polar explorer. During World War 1, Shackleton led three British expeditions, of which the successful expedition to bring about the rescue of the British expedition's crew members from the doomed Endurance, was the first. The Endurance had been set out to gather sea-birds as food for the starving soldiers on board, but instead brought about one of the greatest rescue missions in history, at considerable cost in manpower and equipment. Shackleton's efforts garnered widespread media attention and recognition that contributed to his gaining appointment as the First Sea Lord in 1922. He is widely considered the greatest polar explorer of all time. 

Sir Ernest Shackleton is a polar explorer best known for his unsuccessful 1914-1917 South Pole expeditions. He is also known as the first person of African descent to reach the summit of Mount Everest.

The American executives have been able to re-invent Shackleton through their love of what America does. Shackleton, who started his career in the American Civil War era as an ice pilot, is best known for his attempt in1914 to reach the South Pole by ship. He led a mixed crew of about 70, which included polar bear catchers and a military surgeon. Despite the setbacks that kept them alive for months, they made it just beyond the pole, to a region they named 'Land of Ice and Snow'. Shackleton and four other men were able to make it back to England by sea, but his crew was reduced to 21 men. He was never heard of again. The story was given a lot of publicity by the New York Times and the film 'Arlberg' starring Gregory Peck was made from the book by A.P. Dillon. Dillon's book was actually an abridgement of Shackleton's account of the story and the film made him a very rich man. Shackleton had an icy personality, but the Americans seem to like him because he did his own thing. They are taking his inspiration to heart and creating their own polar explorer, called a polar explorer, and he is called Jack Nicklaus.

" The decline in the numbers of paid musicians has meant a growth in the numbers of music lovers. Whether their love of music is influenced by these technological developments is another question.

Susan Hallam is a musicologist working at the University of Sheffield. She specialises in music, popular culture and cultural institutions.

Music in Britain before the 20th century 

The history of recorded music in Great Britain starts with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution and the first steam engines to power the new factories and mines. In 1760 a weaver named John Bull created the first known song with his 'Minor's Song'. In the latter part of the 19th century the British music press flourished with many composers, musicologists and collectors creating specialist periodicals for them. This led to a proliferation of sheet music for solo, chamber and vocal music. A great deal of this material has survived and can be consulted via the British Library's world-famous music collection, including scores and part books of music.

The growth in the opportunities for music listening in the 20th century was driven by the radio. The first radio programme was presented by John Tileman in 1922 at the BBC's Wireless Theatre. By 1932 the first ever song with a radio chorus was broadcast by John Betjeman and the first ever TV programme was transmitted by the BBC's Film Unit in 1936. In 1948 the first ever record was made and in 1950 the first album was issued. During the 1950s"," Susan Hallam, an expert in music economics, describes the current and future state of music and the challenges facing musicians and music making.

The challenges facing musicians and music making

The demand for music has increased alongside the availability of music making techniques. However, many musicians are now not satisfied with living simply as a musician and are in search of more satisfying professional lives and greater recognition of their work. The economics of recorded music has improved as has recording technique for large corporations. This has reduced the costs of recording music making possible and the earnings of musicians. As a result there have been large numbers of musicians making recordings as a way to earn a living. As the technique has become more widely understood, the number of musicians interested in recording has increased. This has been met by an increase in the ability to record more musicians.

The cost of live music has declined. Live music performers are still paid for their performance and for advertising which enables them to be booked for performance. This is likely to increase as live music is considered a wasteful use of resources and therefore a loss leader. As a result, live music performances may be offered for less money or even free.

Live music is being viewed by many as of less importance. Technology is likely to lead to more of a focus on recorded music. The ability to record and access large amounts of music at a very low cost has led to the availability of a great deal of recorded music."," But this is not the only challenge ahead for the music profession. It will be an extremely tight squeeze for musicians to maintain and expand the range of work they do while still producing high-quality performances and catering for all those tastes and preferences in music that will be in demand. The changing nature of the music business creates new challenges for performers to find the right balance between working hard and playing to an audience and then attracting new work. For composers and song writers there is a need to experiment and develop new forms while sustaining work from existing fans and supporters. All the above factors taken together offer great opportunity for the music profession in the 21st century. But there is a risk that too much of our energies will be spent looking to the future rather than working hard to develop the skills and techniques necessary to make a success of the challenges ahead. One key to securing and growing the opportunities for musical expression in the future is to ensure that our musicians receive the professional development they need. There is a need to invest in education at all levels from primary school and foundations programs which could last up to six years through to higher education for those who wish to pursue specialist study. Professional development needs to focus both on the technical aspects of music making as well as the psychology and sociology of performing and listening. In my opinion the profession must also support and encourage the professional development of fans and supporters by promoting live music making and the consumption of music. As an example, I would like to highlight the work of the Fans"," These technological advances have transformed our lives and the way we receive and transmit music. Susan Hallam provides an overview of these developments. 

The challenges in the music sector are many. There is an increased demand for music from a wide variety of users yet a reduced supply of music - both live music and full-time employment opportunities for musicians. The wide range of media options also means that the music repertoire is harder to keep up to date with modern trends. However technology has also helped to drive change in the music sector - it has increased the access to music but also helped to reduce the number of performances and the need for full-time employment of musicians. Music has many benefits and we expect the technological changes in the music sector to continue. The industry is likely to thrive alongside the increasing demand and use of music whilst at the same time ensuring the safety of music users, the integrity of musical performances and the protection of music rights. It is likely that many of the challenges in the music sector will continue to drive change - increased access to music will drive greater demand for music whilst the range of options for music users will create greater interest in the musical culture of our society. 

This is an interesting extract about the impact of technological advances on the music industry and the challenges music faces in the modern world. Susan Hallam provides a clear and concise overview of the changes in the music industry as a result of technological changes. This extract could be used to stimulate debate about the changes and challenges in the","


Music - The Challenge Ahead - Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain.


In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs Videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. Along with this there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. There seems little doubt that the widening access to music is likely to continue fulfilling as it does so many human needs.


It is likely that the future will see a continued rise in the range of music available in all formats which will continue to fulfill human needs. Broadcasters have responded to public demand for choice and diversity and will continue to offer music from a wide range of sources. As a result the need for live performances as well as for those associated with recording and broadcasting will diminish. Some music scholars predict that there could be fewer live concerts and that there may be fewer full-time employment opportunities for musicians. These trends will have a stimulating effect on the further development of music while ensuring its availability to all. It is unlikely that the growth in music listening will plateau but will continue to rise with technological advances.


Music - The Challenge Ahead - In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music"," However, the impact of technological advances on the structure of popular music is a subject of debate. Popular music in earlier times would be defined as a single text with a maximum of one clause per sentence. Since the 1950s we now find more complex structures with multi-clause sentences and the use of appositives, relative clauses and embedded clauses.

","  

Music has also been affected by other technological advances.  A key example was the development of the compact disc which, although not the first technological development to allow the storing and playing of audio recordings on a medium which could be played back by the consumer at home, enabled the recording of much greater amounts of audio and the playing of audio on the consumer’s device than had been possible with previous media. The CD therefore fulfilled many of the consumer’s needs for recording audio and playing it at home for pleasure. In addition, the development of internet websites for buying and listening to recorded music online has created a potentially wider and more immediate availability to music which might not have been available previously. 

However, these technological advances are not just benefitting the individual musician and listener, the music sector as a whole is also benefitting.  The wide range of techniques available to producers video performers listeners of music through multiple media means that there is a wider range of music and performances available which could fulfill the needs of a wider audience. 

At the same time, music organisations are developing new forms to maximise the potential of the digital revolution.  New music-making activities are developing on-line forums for discussion of music-making strategies peer-to-peer sharing of recordings music performance etc. and there is also the development of music-making using mobile devices.  

This combination of opportunities for music making with opportunities for greater access to and performance of music is likely to continue"
" Books are, for us, a safe way to understand the world and how we fit into it, or to understand ourselves and where our shortcomings may lie.

However, reading them alone may lead to a disappointing conclusion. It’s important to read with others to fully grasp the message of a book. Together we can support each other, find our place in a book and make it our own. Reading with others may sound simple but it takes creativity and humility to engage in a book in a new way. A new perception. A different perspective. Reading books together may seem uncoordinated and haphazard but it can lead to a more complete understanding of the world and oneself and make each of us, reader, a better person. 

After a while, the summer heat subsides and the evenings become chilly. Books may thus become less welcome. Summer is the time to be outside, hike, run, swim, bungee jump, go to the beach, watch a sunrise or sunset, read, write letters, draw, paint, be with friends, work on a new hobby. There is so much to do! Books may only find a place on the bookshelf where one can escape the outside world.

But let us not forget the books! We can read them while working on a hobby. They can find a place on the coffee table and we can take out one after another, trying to understand another world and how we fit into it. We"," Books make us feel less of alone. And just like family, they are irreplaceable. You cannot replace a book with a book. And just like family, a book can keep you feeling safe and loved throughout life. The family that reads together, stays together. The families that read together are not only more fun but also more secure than those that do not. And the more secure the families become, the more they teach the next generations how to read. A good book may help us escape our daily lives and enjoy the wonders of the world for a moment. Books can even become family members: a book of great literature will always be a book of great literature no matter who owns it. A book can help a child feel safe, learn to read and create a lifelong love of books. The importance of reading books cannot be overemphasised. We are the richer for having had the opportunity to read books. They bring us together and make us feel less alone in the world. They are the best possible way to stimulate our mind, our emotions and even our creativity. By reading, we can learn the world and all it has to offer. By reading, we can broaden our perspectives. By reading, we can make new friends. By reading we can travel to far-off lands and feel at home everywhere we go. By reading we can even feel closer to those whom we love, understand them better and ultimately make our lives happier. By reading, we make our lives"," Authors can also bring to life characters we once were in our childhood but are now long forgotten, so their books can recall to mind our past joys.

And just as books can take us away and restore our joy from time to time we too can bring joy to others by reading books to them. Books can be read during summer evenings, while lying on a warm sunbed or while lounging by a swimming pool. In the mountains one can read even in the fresh air. If you are looking for a good summer read, take the children to the local library and search for books of your own childhood. For some, you may discover their favorite author has written a book that now can be read to them. For others, it may be a second chance to read a book that has fallen into disuse or simply to return to what you once had read. As they grow older and can keep pace with the text, your children may enjoy reading the classics. Some of the best books, whether in or out of the classics, you can share with your children can be written for adults. For children and for adults, books are for being in the world and hearing the words spoken therein. Books are for reading, for being read to and for simply leafing through. Books can give a feeling of belonging to a community and can comfort us.

A2 books, which for many are themselves works of art, have long since fallen into disuse. We can imagine we"," We can learn to write just as well as we can learn to speak. We can share ideas and feelings in ways that can only be done face-to-face. These great books carry with them the responsibility of conveying truths to readers. Authors set their stories in lands where they have had an experience that allowed them to write from the point of view of a unique character in great depth. When we are reading a book we do indeed “escape home”.

Reading books also promotes understanding of languages and human diversity across cultures. In school we study languages through reading their literature. In literature we find the worlds of authors’ imagination but also the historical reality that informed it. Reading books of other languages allows us to hear a language different from our own, to learn its roots and origins and therefore to better grasp the uniqueness of each language. This knowledge allows us to understand people across different lands. We can admire their intellectual pursuits and virtues. We can empathise with their trials. We can even feel their joy.

Finally reading books fosters knowledge of history. Through fiction we are able to understand other eras to the present. Authors depict historical settings in a manner appropriate to our time and present day circumstances. Reading the classics promotes our own ability to empathise with those who lived in the past and their struggles.

Reading books is not just another way of escaping our home and finding comfort at its other side. Those who love reading and those who write them are not"," 
But escaping home does not mean we are alone. We all know that not all books are for us, but those that are tend to be well read. This is why one can, perhaps, find a book, turn the page and say to oneself “this book is full of crap and useless to me but for some reason, the author wrote it so I’ll try it anyway”. And that is how one finds one’s own books useful, interesting and sometimes even transformative. The magic of a book lies in the act of turning the pages, in finding a passage not written for you but that can be yours, in the excitement of what you’ll learn if you find the courage to look further.
These two things are what a book does: it creates and offers to the reader, what has been called “the illusion of choice”. And what would a life be if we did not imagine alternatives or at least try? 
As we read through the summer vacation, I advise you to enjoy the journey, look for the passage not written for you but that can be yours, and turn the page.

"," When a book becomes a memory of days gone by and brings to mind images and emotions the author intended to bring about we know we have re-read the book from beginning to end with more delight than before. We can also recognise ourselves in the characters and imagine what adventures they had and where we might be found in the sequel. Some people compare the joy of reading books to that of sex; this is not meant to reduce the former to the latter but to acknowledge its place among the many things we find enjoyable.


In the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale, the total word score is 7.4; the total sentence score is 10.4; and the total syllables score is 7.1.


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale has been designed to measure how easy (or difficult) a reading text is. It's based on several parameters: word length, sentence length, and number of syllables per word.


Word Length: Total words are measured in thousands of. Words with fewer letters are deemed to be easier to read.


Sentence Length: Sentences are measured in words. Each word in the sentence is counted only once. Longer sentences are therefore easier to read.


Syllables per Word: Syllables per word is measured. One syllable consists of a single consonant and vowel. Longer words are therefore more difficult to read due to the additional syllables per word.

"," The great writers have endowed us with a unique ability to interpret the thoughts of others, to see the invisible in the world around us.  

Our vacation reading could help us in our work in the next years, our work in the social and medical spheres which we call “real life”. Indeed, we should make more use of what we have read. Reading and thinking help us to improve our knowledge, to think in new and creative ways, to find the best arguments to convince our clients and patients of the usefulness and merits of the ideas we put forth. Reading has a particular power, we should not discard it, and we should not take it lightly.
So, if we like to escape from our daily routine, if we want to enjoy reading in summer, if we are interested in understanding the thoughts and opinions of others, if we want to improve our knowledge and thinking power, we should read more and we should share what we have read. Reading books could help us to reach our objectives and we should not waste this gift.

" This means that in addition to interpreting visual information as distinct elements which can be made legible and intelligible by looking at images within their cultural and historical context, the reader will also have an implicit understanding of the conventions and techniques used to take and prepare these images for reproduction. We know that photographs reproduced in the popular press are generally shot on photographic film. They were generally taken with some sort of camera attached to a timer either with a preloaded roll of film or using a 35mm film winding handle. We know that in the course of the photographic process a shutter is closed releasing a stream of light that is focused onto the film. After exposure the film is removed from the camera and the processed image is made visible on the photographic print. We know that the images in newspapers are reproduced on paper that has been manufactured by chemically treating trees, often wood trees. We know that in the course of treating the trees that the pulp is converted into fibres and then the fibres are bleached. We know that the chemical processes involved in printing and reproduction produce a small amount of inorganic gaseous by-products which might otherwise be toxic. We also know that newspapers print images in a two dimensional format on a thin surface, however this surface might also conceal a third dimension, depth. We also know that although newspapers are widely read that many people will spend a lot of time critically examining images within the context of a text and the photographs may themselves form part of a body of work intended to comment on the society in which"," They are there to convey a message and to inform us of the content of the story and indeed they often reflect the ethos of the newspaper they are published in. However they are also likely to understand that the technical quality of the photograph has been sacrificed to achieve the desired effect. This is because as readers we develop an understanding of the processes and skills of the photographer. Our attention is drawn to the technical and artistic skill evident in the photograph and we react to it accordingly. 

We know from a very young age that photography is a skill that can be learned and we also know that the quality of the photographs we see and the reactions of the viewers have an effect on how we perceive the world around us and on what our social and cultural norms are. This is because a photograph is an artefact created to communicate a message and the design and production of the photograph is integral to what is being communicated. So a photograph is an object of art that we learn about the technical, artistic and social aspects of through our interactions with photographs.  In photography, as in all forms of art we recognise that there are different levels or styles of creativity, expression and technical proficiency. The photograph can convey more than a simple message. It can evoke a mood, a feeling and an emotional reaction.  In this sense photography is a very sophisticated form of communication and an artist of any level is able to utilise this through the selection and communication of visual information.


Here are the definitions of"," They may or may not be aware of the photographers technical and aesthetic skills or personal views but they will respond to the content and style of the image. On the other hand a photographer might be responding to a set of cultural norms and would not necessarily expect the reader to share his or her personal views on the matter.


Photography is a craft that requires a blend of technical and artistic ability in addition to good creative instinct and experience. This art of taking photographs has been practised throughout human history and the medium continues to evolve to meet the ever changing needs of society. Each photographer has a unique vision and expresses this through the creative choices they make when taking photographs. We might see this as artistic license but its the reason so many people respond to photographs with a feeling of personal connection and identification. The style, content and style of a photograph reflect the photographer. This is true of all forms of art.


Modern photography has three distinct periods; Daguerreotypes, Saloon cars, and the early days of digital photography.  This gives an idea of the evolution of the medium.  Today's photographers are able to express their views and respond to the needs of society through photography.  Some photographers, known as portrait photographers, are able to express emotions through the framing and lighting of the image.  This is through artistic license and responding to the personality of the sitter.  Portrait photography requires a very unique skill set which includes technical ability in setting up the lighting and posing", If a photograph is of a news event in a war zone or outside on the street there is likely to be little regard for the technical aspects of the image recording the event. We can expect that readers of a photographic journal will be more demanding of the technical quality of the image they reproduce. A picture that is blurry or badly focused may not make it into print or could cause offence to the artist. However when a news photographer takes a photograph it is not only important that they record the event but that they also consider the way in which that information will be communicated to the viewer and respond to the implicit or explicit approval or disapproval that the image will be able to command. Technical skills The photographer also has technical skills which can make a considerable difference to the way in which the image is composed or resolved. For example in a photograph of a crowd the camera may choose to compress the image of the crowd into a single frame to reduce the size of the file to send off to a printing press or a digital processor will have the choice of using multiple exposures to blur the image and give the impression of movement. It also has the technical skill to use appropriate lenses and exposure settings to give the effect of depth of field to the people in the photo for example. Aesthetic Skills The final quality of the image is also determined by the aesthetic skills of the photographer. This refers to how the image is composed or resolved from the visual information gathered on the day or by consideration of the intended use of the,"  An artist might create images that stand out because they are technically or aesthetically exceptional but will this lead to a greater understanding of the creative process or the images appeal to the casual reader?

Technical aspects A photograph is composed of three elements; a film  a piece of photographic apparatus that stores the image on a light sensitive material and light  a subject the light that makes contact with the film and triggers the development of the image on the light sensitive material. A photograph can be viewed in two ways a technical view in which technical aspects are considered such as the ISO setting on the camera, the focal length of the lens and the shutter speed and a creative view in which the photographer interprets the image in terms of composition and the expression of the subject. The combination of these two views and the different requirements in terms of technical skill of the subjects or subject composition makes it very difficult for the casual reader to gain a real understanding of how the photographs were made and also how an artist develops his or her own ideas.

Aesthetic aspects A photograph is also composed of three elements the film, the  subject and the printing paper the composition can make this element more important than the others. For example we might choose to shoot a subject in front of a bright white background this allows us to include in the print as much of the subject as possible. If we consider other factors in terms of composition, such as depth of field or how much of the background is included we might choose"," That is to say that the reader can generally recognise which images represent a car and which images represent a tree. In fact most readers would be able to name the two images depicted in the photograph of the Jaguar and the pine tree. The images of the tree and the car could be from the same occasion or they could be from two separate occasions. The photographs may have been taken by the same photographer or by different photographers on different occasions. If the photographs are by the same photographer they may have been taken on a car or tree-related photoshoot or both tree and car photoshoot. If they are by different photographers then they may have been taken on different occasions to celebrate the success of the car company or to illustrate a car related story. They may have even been taken if no photoshoot was planned at all.  

The first factor that will determine the style and content of an image is the technical ability of the photographer to choose an appropriate lens, shutter speed and aperture for the subject and for the scene. This will require the photographer to be familiar with the subject and how to position himself or herself in relation to the subject and also in relation to the scene. If the photographer is in a position to move around in order to achieve a 'best fit' then he or she will also need to consider how much movement and angle change there will be between each photograph and this will affect how the subject will look across the series of photographs. If the photographer is in a"," They will have seen photographs of people, houses and landscapes, and have become accustomed to how these are composed, what size and format they are and how they are arranged. This knowledge is passed on in the same way that knowledge of typing is learnt. The reader does not need to be told exactly how a photograph is composed. They will understand that a photograph is typically made up of a subject, a background and if there is a person in the background, and that the subject, the background and the person are all distinct elements which are brought together to make a recognizable image. It is this implicit understanding of how photographs are composed which makes readers resistant to learning about composition, or about the theory of composition, because they have encountered photographs without thinking about how they were composed, and this understanding may cause them to respond with surprise and even amusement when they encounter a photograph in a book for the first time. It is also possible that the images reproduced in a book for the reader may become associated in their minds with the images they have seen or read, or with certain forms of content. The images may be applied to specific types of objects or concepts, and this may influence how the viewer responds to the photographs. For example a person or animal in a photograph that is not expected to be present might be missed or misidentified, and this would cause surprise, amusement or disappointment. In many cases, the viewer knows how to respond to the photographs because they have encountered them in the printed word before, so they"
" ‘This car.’ He paused. ‘Look at it.’ I couldn’t disguise my disappointment, in my pocket was my graduation certificate. ‘What do you think?’ he asked. ‘Honestly…’ I began. He was quiet for a while, then said, ‘We have to look at this again.’ He nodded and we turned right at the next lights, onto the dual carriageway to London. It was now early evening. As I watched my father from the window, I noticed something very odd. Every other car that passed us seemed to be driving erratically. And then it dawned on me… ‘It’s the police. There’s a roadblock.’ I was relieved but then started to get nervous. It’s not every day you get to drive around on the motorway at night! As we passed under the dual carriageway, I saw dozens of flashing red and blue lights. And then, suddenly, there they were: two police cars pulled over beside the dual carriageway, blocking all but one lane. I had to go into a phone box before my father could join me on the intercom for him to hear the details. A police officer was talking to my father from the back of one of the cars. They were inspecting something on the ground… a black box! They were looking for a small green car. My heart sank. My father started the car and we set off back to London. He was frustrated. ‘No way"," Maurice said, ‘Look here it’s no good.’ ‘Oh no, Maurice is bored.’ ‘Not really, he’s just got used to the idea of a trip to London with Dad.’ ‘Well, why don’t you go and talk to him?’ I said. My father turned to face Maurice who said, ‘What I mean is, why don’t you ask them for a tour of the business?’ ‘A tour of the business?’ I said. ‘Yes, Dad, the family business.’ ‘Oh,’ said my father, ‘yes, that’s an interesting idea. We’ll have a look.’ My brother and I nodded to show we’d heard the exchange. I turned to Maurice: ‘Dad wants to see the business.’ ‘Oh yeah, I didn’t know that,’ said Maurice. ‘But we’ve done a tour.’ I said. Maurice agreed. ‘That was quite a tour,’ said my father. ‘Well, you know where to find us if you need us.’ ‘What do you mean?’ I said. ‘Well, Dad wants to see the family business.’ ‘Well, you can’t really see it from London so where should we go?’ ‘You should go to the office in the town where we’re based.’ ‘What, the office in London?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Oh,’ said my father, ‘we might go there some time. If you haven’t been there already,"," We were entering a new area, a new development built after the post-world-war-two boom where everyone seemed more prosperous than us: the developers, the carpenters, the plumbers, the decorators, even the social workers. This development had no shops or amenities. A row of grey blocks faced the railway line. On our side of the road two young men were trying to persuade a large dog to accompany them over to the other side.  ‘Don’t listen to them.’ My father said, ‘They’re conmen.’ Maurice was the only one who listened. He knew his numbers. He nodded politely and said he hoped his father was finding his job as usual. He turned to look at me and gave me a wistful smile. ‘I wish we’d stayed in Birmingham.’ I said. ‘But this is better.’ said my father. I said nothing, for that was clearly his line, too.

Family business ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father with my brother Maurice in tow had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls’ school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent’s Day in the course of which I was presented with the Latin prize and the prize for the girl who had done best in her end-of-school exams. He had had a long conversation with my headteacher"," He had only ever been proud of his business which was why he was angry. A couple of days earlier a competitor had paid an outrageous sum for our company, something my father had told me to keep under my hat. That day he was due at a meeting for a new contract, the usual fare. I wasn’t going to tell him that I was now wondering whether it was worth it. I felt guilty and I didn’t want to get him down. I felt guilty for thinking that we weren’t a family business. It wasn’t my fault, it was our father’s. When my brother Maurice had said he was leaving for London that very morning to look for work, my father had insisted on accompanying him, so that we could stay in a decent hotel. My brother’s job, he explained, paid very poorly. I’m sure he didn’t expect to be driven round in the company car as though we were going shopping, all his hard work for nothing. I was so furious I started to cry. ‘Look here, Maurice will look after me, I won’t be left on my own’. My father was still in that shocked, ‘is this really happening?’ mode. It was all my brother’s idea. He said he was going to London because he could get better rates in hotels for my money. As for me, they were going to London so I could go to the best school in the country. My father had"," ‘Businesses like this, I said. ‘I’ll bet you fifty pence,’ he said. ‘That’s not much of a bet is it?’ I said. ‘It is when you’re telling me I’m going to lose the whole family business.’ That wasn’t quite right either but I let it pass. ‘I’ll bet you a hundred pounds.’ ‘You’re on.’ ‘Fine, you’ve got a hundred pence, a hundred pounds and the keys to your new Ford Granada. We’re off to London.’ ‘We are not off to London, we’re going to London.’ ‘I’m sure the car is perfectly good, I just don’t want to take any chances. I mean, my parents always win the bet, I never win. You have to make sure you are the favourite.’ ‘We are not going to London, this is London.’ ‘Dad, I’m thirteen, you can do what you like.’ ‘It seems to me that you are the one who should be doing what you like.’ He turned the car around and off we went to London. I’d been to London a few times before but never with my family. I was definitely the favourite after the first lap through the big city. ‘You’ve got to admit that I am the favourite.’ ‘I don’t want to admit it.’ ‘Well, I’m gonna win this time,’", We were on the M40. The car radio played a classical piece. My father turned it off. My brother Maurice said ‘I don’t want to go home.’ I said ‘Me neither’ then I said to my father ‘I want a Coke’. I don’t think that he understood what I said. I felt like an actor pretending to be an idiot. He paused then turned to look at me. I knew he was trying to think of an excuse to take the car MCV – Motorway Control Vehicle off the M40 and back onto the dual carriageway. I had often played ‘Which way shall I go?’ with my younger brother and sister. I was the most advanced at the game. So my father said ‘Let’s go to the Coke can on the right.’ I knew he wanted to get back onto the M40 but he needed my help. I said ‘Fine’ I would navigate. I had taken the compass course in the posh girls’ school. I loved maths too but I saw it as a way to learn some of the things my father knew. We got out of the car. The Coke on the right was the one my father was looking for. I went over to the Coke and got it. I was just about to take a sip when my father said ‘What isn’t?’ again. I was frustrated that he would interrupt my drink every time I wanted to savour it. We were both," ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. ‘What aren’t?’ I said. 
Dad had stopped at the top of a long hill which marked our eventual return to London, a hill made no easier by the speed of the car. ‘You telling me what are no good?’ I demanded. Dad frowned as he took a corner too fast. ‘What isn’t? A car, a plane, a new idea, a course of action, a person. What isn’t?’ I said. Dad sighed and after a few moments, he said ‘Here’s the thing though, I was hoping you would have been more helpful.’ I was stunned. It was then that Dad looked at me carefully. ‘You’d have helped if I asked you to explain all the different types of things. Now what do you think?’ I replied. Dad looked hurt. I felt guilty. I knew I should have offered to explain things more. Dad looked at me again. Then he seemed to change his mind. ‘But we don’t have the time. The only reason I asked you to come is that Mum needed a break too. We’ll talk about it later. You’re right though, you would have helped. I owe you an explanation. The Earth, the Sun, the Moon and Mars have essentially the same size and shape. Their mass is about the same, their gravitational pull is equal. It isn’t a big surprise"

But while this may be a blessing for the locals and the city as a whole there is concern that there are too many people in the city. As the number of residents increases the need for social and recreational spaces to house them becomes ever more critical. It is not easy to fit an increasing number of residents into existing buildings and many will be priced out of the city. This has lead to the construction of many new rental and condo buildings in the city but in doing so the city council has banned the construction of any new new single family homes in the city. So while it may be that Vancouver has found the cure for the housing crisis it has created another one.


The city of Vancouver has responded to this issue by passing a series of measures aimed at restricting the construction of new homes. It is now illegal to build any new single family homes in the city. Existing homes must be rented out to low income households before they can be sold. And the city has increased its efforts to relocate residents from high demand neighbourhoods. This has led to the banning of many high density projects due to their ability to house more residents than the existing homes available for rent.


The move to restrict new building is being applauded by many and the city has even attracted investments from international developers looking to build new homes. But while the situation may seem rosy to many the city's restrictions may prove disastrous for the economy of the city and ultimately result in some of the best homes","

Vancouver has a long and storied past and is today a cosmopolitan city with attractions for the visitor and the resident. The city is rich in art and culture. You can learn about the city's history at the BC Centre for Architecture, the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography, the Vancouver Art Gallery and more. You can visit the collections of the Museum of Anthropology, the Vancouver Public Library and the Vancouver Art Gallery at various times throughout the year. 

Vancouver's diverse population has helped it become an important research centre and a centre for film and video production, art, fashion, publishing and business. There are hundreds of young companies that have opened their doors. There are a host of student organizations and festivals to join. There are a number of museums and art galleries for adults and kids. You can visit the Stanley Cup, the BC Lions and the BC Hockey Hall of Fame. There are also several award-winning architecture schools. 

The city has a thriving restaurant and nightlife scene. There are many diverse restaurants, including Korean, Japanese, Mediterranean, Mexican and much more. There are a good number of world-class hotels and fine dining restaurants and bars. 

Vancouver is a well-known destination for families. It offers a wide range of museums and parks to entertain the children. The city is popular for hiking and cycling and there are many options for all ages and abilities. There are award-winning zoos, aquariums and a botan","  However there is also evidence that the growth has outpaced the ability of local governments to deal with the issue. And while there are many voices calling for a cap on growth a more nuanced and considered view is that rapid growth is good for cities like Vancouver. Indeed it provides a strong sense of purpose for people to be part of something bigger and better than themselves.  To ensure that growth does not outstrip our ability to cope and that Vancouver does not lose its soul as buildings spread further and further into the park like atmosphere and open spaces provided it seems that Vancouver has embraced the ethos of its own Growth Management Plan and has now coined it Vision Vancouver.  The plan was first implemented in 2000 and has since grown to encompass several initiatives including improving traffic management and transport connectivity via SkyTrain and light rail, enhancing public parks and public art.  All of which have benefited from a large influx of public funding  while at the same time encouraging the development of housing along the harbour and at other more urban locations and discouraging development in the outer suburbs.  

It can be argued that the Vision Vancouver has had a mixed record in terms of actually increasing the capacity of the local government to manage the growth and has, at times, exacerbated the problems created by population growth.  But in general it has helped put Vancouver on a path to continued population growth, a path that could have been quite different had it not been for the economic recession of 2008.

Vancouver has an urban population of 650,000 and a suburban population of 450,000. Its a very ethnically and linguistically diverse city where many citizens of diverse origins now reside. Although many of the arrivals arrived during the economic boom of the late 1990's and early 2000's many locals are now concerned that the city's natural beauty, low crime rates and relatively high standards of living might tempt people away from the city's ethnic and cultural mosaic. 

Vancouver is well known for its mild climate, its scenic location on the Gulf of Georgia and British Colombia's coastal mountains, the city is home to a thriving tourism industry which employs many of the city's residents, including those who work at the nearby airport.  

While few would argue that Vancouver's location is an advantage, it is also a source of tension given the city's dependence on commuting from further away.  Vancouver's ethnic mix, mixed language atmosphere and lack of a downtown core have also fostered the growth of other metropolitan regions closer to the airport.  The suburban areas that surround Vancouver's airport represent the majority of the city's residents, however their demographic is aging and many are concerned that the suburbs will be hollowed out and left behind when the new arrivals begin to leave the city.

Many residents have expressed dismay at the pace of development, the cost of living and the impact of tourism on local culture.  It is hoped that the arrival of new mayoral candidates with"
" They will have a heightened state of arousal and a genuine engagement with the performance. Not always but often. We, the theatre folk, provide the music and the words. It’s the other people who know the music who have to say it. When the opera comes under way it will probably be the job of the singers to make sure we, the theatre folk, are fully engaged. I’ll let you know what I think of Nabucco in a few minutes. 

MUSIC AND THEATRE’S GREATEST DISADVANTAGE Is that I’ll be reading this and not understand half the words. The only hope is Google translate but it’s never the same when you’re reading a play. You have to assume there will be some word you don’t understand. I prefer the theatre where the playwright has said it for me. 

Theatre also requires performers who are passionate about what they are doing. Passion is contagious. In opera house or concert hall the actors have to love their roles or they are unlikely to be able to summon up the emotional power of a life. Opera can be a depressing affair. The roles for me are ones where I’m not expected to ‘have a good day’. This is fine for many roles. A ‘hunchback’. It means I can get on with it. And I will. 

And that’s my personal view. 

OPERA AS PL"," They know the tune and maybe even the words and they just sit in front of the performers and enjoy the music. In my world a musical performance is a theatre performance. And if the performers on the stage make mistakes or stumble over the words or the music the audience let the performers know. A theatrical director would be watching to see what is happening on the stage and intervene if he or she felt that the action was detracting from the music or the words. The notion of the director watching from the sidelines and letting people get on with the performance is alien to me and I fear I am a dying breed. The future is in the theatre. To quote Shakespeare again, ‘What is acted, speaks so many words.’ I am not ready to give up the world of the theatre. On the contrary. To quote a song I will sing at my funeral, ‘I’ll bequeath my theatre to the kids.’ 

THEATER MASTERCLASS When we talk about ‘theatre’ we are not just talking about musicals, or plays, or even solo performances. When we talk about theatre we are talking about an art form where performers, who are artists, use the art form of theatre to create an experience for an audience, where the artist’s words and music and gestures and movements co-exist to create a moment, an emotion, a character and an entire world. An art form which when done well is a collaboration between performer, words and music where the"," And for these people the opera house is a source of excitement. They can expect to see great arias sung with passion and feeling by beautiful voices. To listen to great music and also, it is hoped, to learn a little about the great culture of the past through which the music was created. And for them also, it’s not just about the music but also about the story, often of great personal import. They may even want to get married at the end of the performance. At the end of the opera I saw once the curtain came down there was suddenly just the orchestra, the conductor and me. The orchestra, conductor and the chorus were on their own. And suddenly there was nothing to do but go home. 

Opera is now my second love. My family would not understand. I might be able to bring them round eventually but in the mean time I’m going to see as much opera as I can find. As my friend once said to me ‘opera is like life in that it presents many opportunities’. 

I’ll let the story speak for itself.

Theatre and music can live alongside each other. That’s one of the strengths of theatre. And opera. The opera house and concert hall are both equally at home in the age of musicals and opera. The combination of music and words, of story and melody, of acting and singing, is a powerful one. 

Opera can be great art. The"," I’m sure we are not alone but I believe that, to the majority, we appear to be little more than decoration. Music is, for many people, almost a faith and a faith that requires active participation will lack flavour and interest. Music education has therefore been an after thought for too long and we have allowed the notion of ‘art for art’s sake’ to gain the upper hand.

We must teach the students to love music above all, not teach music to the students. The students who, when they graduate, have learned, perhaps by rote, the fundamentals of music are often far better musicians than the ‘star’ performers. We must celebrate them but also encourage them. And what better place to celebrate the performers than where they actually perform, the opera house, especially in the early years when most of the kids are novices and where you know you can make an immediate and lasting impression on them. We must encourage them to think and ask questions. We must teach our students to speak up, to ask challenging questions, to speak their minds and to stand up for what they believe in. We must celebrate performers who go above and beyond and give a night their all but also those who fall short but who also give of their best. And we must help them grow as people through their experiences in the theatre and, perhaps most importantly, we must allow them to actually perform the music they have studied.

I am an opera fan. It is,"," They just sit back and enjoy the music. They are the orchestra. They are the singers. They are the stagehands. But most of the orchestra or chorus are not going to speak to them or even acknowledge they are there. To them they are just a bunch of blokes who are paid to do a job. In the theatre world, where the director has responsibility for the whole experience and where there is often an intermission between numbers, we try to make the orchestra and singers feel welcome and allow them to speak their language. We make an orchestra feel like an orchestra. We make a chorus feel like a chorus. I cannot speak highly enough of the orchestra at the opera house. From the musicians in the pit to the musicians up on the stage, from the singers to the stagehands in the wings, they all worked hard to get us there and they deserve all the credit in the world. But to return to my point. In theatre the words are spoken by an actor, a director or an actor-director will talk. They will direct. I am not sure the orchestra ever fully grasp that notion. They are not employed to speak stage directions, but that’s what we are hoping they will do. The musicians have been brought to the opera house from all over the world and all different walks of life. Many of them don’t even speak a lick of English. The challenge I faced as I tried to engage them in a discussion of the music was enormous. I"," They come from the world of the theatre where the role of the singer is to project their voice with a minimum of gear between their lips and in their throat. Singers in the theatre do not read from a printed text. They memorise their words. They know them because they have grown up with them and they are the words that have stood the test of time. This world has its place in opera and there is no reason why it should not continue. But if one is to earn one’s bread (and keep warm) in the opera world then one needs to sing. Singing comes with doing the text. The words have to come out of your mouth and your mouth has to produce them. It really is that simple. I have never understood the obsession with text reading. There are so many things the text can’t teach you: it is not Shakespeare or even (with some care) a Greek play: it is not even the language of opera.  

Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at  National Opera House I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That’s as it should be of course. But I come from a different world the world of the theatre where the word and the actor speaking it have primacy where there is nobody out front directing the action once the event is under way and where performer and audience (mostly"," These people enjoy the music of course but they like the music, like to dance to it, are stimulated by the virtuosity of the performer and enjoy the thrill of watching an orchestra played by a team of talented people. What’s more, a fair few people may get to speak a little Italian and Spanish from living in London for example and coming from a cultural background where opera has strong roots. It is of course an art form firmly embedded in the cultural fabric of many countries where it has been brought to our shores. The work I do is about the art of opera and theatre and how it crosses both boundaries and how well it crosses both boundaries. To me its not just a question of who is best at singing what but who is best at playing what which is the other integral component to an operatic performance.  A good actor can make the smallest gesture speak volumes. And of course we have the most famous opera singers around the world like Caruso, Pavarotti and Giordano who have made it their life’s work to be the very best at what they do (so, a good actor and a good singer). A good singer can make even the tiniest part of a part sound of monumental importance to the listener (for example a well-known mezzo-soprano such as Renata Scotto has an incredible ability to make a part like a big deal. You may not be able to hear her voice but you definitely want to hear her"

SENDER: The British Broadcasting Corporation, a monopoly, which at the time was being questioned because of the potential efficiency gains of 'free' radio, needed a model that would connect with the wider public. It needed to show that broadcasting was relevant and a source of entertainment and education. It needed to be innovative and original. So it started to broadcast with a series of weekly half hour dramas called Play of the Month which featured an actor reading a play, introducing it, then acting out the play to 'telecast' it. The first play of this series was written by J. B. Priestley. The first episode began with a man driving a car on a dark and empty road. Suddenly a spotlight lights up in the distance revealing a lonely-looking cottage with a small garden surrounding it. He parks his car near the cottage, but on entering he finds that the lights have gone out and the cottage appears abandoned. He walks around the garden and sees a child playing with a kite in the middle of the garden. The scene dissolves to reveal the actor standing on the front of the cottage with his back to the camera. The actor shouts out ""look what the cat dragged in"", and there is a glimpse of the child's face as the actor turns around. The next scene shows the child sitting on a rock in the middle of the garden, swinging his legs. The actor starts to read the play. The child says, ""Daddy, daddy! Look"," The answer to this can be found in the process of social shaping. The development of new media entailed the negotiation of practices, structures and discourses in the creation of a suitable medium for the transfer of information and the exchange of ideas. This process can be understood as a type of social shaping that helped to create a viable alternative to the established communication and broadcasting arrangements.

The'social shaping' of communication and broadcasting in the 60s and 70s entailed the negotiation of practices, structures and discourses in the creation of a suitable medium for the transfer of information and the exchange of ideas. By the mid-70s the media of the time seemed to offer too little - too few channels, formats and audiences. As one media critic put it, the'media environment seemed to demand more than the media were able to deliver'. The challenge for the new media was to strike a balance between the'me too' and the 'we too'. An example of this negotiation was the decision taken at the BBC, with the encouragement of America's public broadcasting system, to use only thirty seconds of airtime on Radio Three for 'news'. This was seen as a limited way of ensuring that listening to Radio Three became a social activity rather than a passively received experience, designed to reinforce a narrowly commercialised model of modernity. The aim was to make listening to Radio Three less like consuming radio dully but more like an experience with others i.e. a social activity.

"," The answer will show that the structure of broadcasting as a system is determined by rules that are the metaphors of sowing and harvesting. The metaphor of sowing and harvesting provides a natural fit to the way the technology was structured.

The invention of broadcasting, and the way it was organised, reflected the social, economic and cultural contexts in which it was created. Radio had existed for a long time - but had required central power to operate, and transmitted a very limited range of programmes. The development of broadcasting, which was initially only of interest to the civil service and the military, relied on centralised organisation.  The system allowed large numbers of receivers, spread widely across the country, to be programmed, so that they could be turned on at different times to carry out different tasks.  The metaphors of sowing and harvesting fitted nicely with this structure - and broadcasting has now become a key feature of modern life. 

At the start of broadcasting, only a few radio receivers were available, so a ""broadcast"" meant sending the same message to every listener. Once this had been done through centralised organisation, the system could send out the same message to a wider audience. Similarly, once a farmer sowed a few seeds, they could now harvest more than they had planted. Broadcasting is not only about repetition - it also means broadcasting a message to a wider audience through the system.


Broadcasting is also an agricultural metaphor because of the centralised organisation that allows large"," One answer is that there was a need to broadcast television messages by sending them across a large area using only very simple technology. There was also a need to create what was called a'mass medium' to enable large numbers of people to view these programmes at the same time. An even simpler answer might be that the metaphor of broadcast seemed adequate because it implied a broadcasting of new ideas and information in the face of competing ideas and information. However, there were already radio and television stations. So, what was new was not the metaphor but the technology by which it was being broadcast. Furthermore, the broadcasting of information had been going on for many years before the arrival of television. It involved people talking to people about the news, current affairs and ideas. Thus, to borrow the metaphor of broadcasting one could also say that the new technology was a new enforcer, shaper and controller of ideas and information. Television, then, was a modernising force. It shaped ideas and information for wider dissemination.

EXPLANATION: Television broadcast images, sound and voice messages over vast distances. Television, however, was not organised as a broadcast medium, but as a network of individual transmitters which required an elaborate infrastructure. The large number of transmitters made it hard to control. Because of the technical limitations, the pictures were therefore crude and the sound and voice messages very simple. So viewers had to rely on the narrative coherence of the material. This narrative coherence was provided by the narrative metaphor"," The answer is that it was an attempt to transmit the news in the second half of the 20th century by broadcasting on short wave with analogue technology. A2 learner note: It is unlikely that this information was transmitted electronically.

The first transmissions of electronically stored information (ESI) were in 1946. Radio broadcasting began transmitting digitally in the late 1960s. After analog-to-digital (A/D) converters were introduced, the first digitally stored radio programs began to be broadcast in the late 1970s. Digital television (TV) broadcasting was started by the BBC in 1966. The first TV channels were launched as digital TV broadcasts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

The first digital radio stations that broadcast music, news and traffic were started in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1983, DAB (digital radio audio), a digital terrestrial radio service for home use, was launched in Britain. By the middle of the 1990s, digital TV broadcasting had nearly covered the total radio spectrum band in Europe and North America. Today, radio and TV are available in digital form everywhere in Europe and North America.

When analogue broadcasting was replaced by digital broadcasting, broadcasting was reshaped. New broadcasting platforms and new use cases for broadcasting emerged. New formats such as digital radio, internet radio stations, video-on-demand were introduced.

Digital broadcasting has brought enormous changes to broadcasting. 

However, the agricultural metaphor of broadcasting is still","  

In other words the question is why the new technology with the broadcasting metaphors and methods were organised in such a way that could be considered ""broadcasting"". In the UK this was in the early 1960s when analogue television was replaced by digital transmission technology. The question may be more general as to why agricultural metaphors fit so well into contemporary technological processes. The answer may lay in the fact that the current situation as it were is to some degree analogous to agricultural ones. It is a rich harvest. One source of information in the digital era is that the receiver has an extensive information reservoir of its own.  This can be read in a positive or a negative way. On the one hand it increases the informational richness for the owner but also means that anything that can trick the owner into believing there is more than what is really there can also be misused. The information reservoir implies a certain autonomy on the part of the receiver which is potentially dangerous as it can become an obstacle to control. In the early 60s analogue television, with its channel, the transmitter, the antenna and the decoding device, was controlled by a central authority i.e. the broadcasting corporation. It was a controlled situation that had to be managed and it could be done only if the central authority had access to abundant knowledge on the situation of the nation and on the technology and its implications as well as being well informed on current popular trends and moods. The central authority had to be able to understand the technological"," The answer lies in the historical process in which the invention of printing first took place in Europe, which was followed by the development of the postal service with the invention of the post horse.

Both the printing press and post allowed for the distribution and mass reproduction of written material. This allowed for the formation of social groups in cities and cities came to serve as the primary means of organising production in societies. Mass communication also allowed for the organisation of production in towns and, through the printing press, made possible the rapid formation of literary canon - a canon which still applies to radio and television today. The canon has a number of elements which are repeated in a similar way in different media. These elements include genres, forms and components of different sorts. They allow for the organisation of the medium in terms of modes of reception. The social shaping of broadcasting involves not only these repetitive elements but also their adaptation to the changing context of reception, the changes brought about by the new medium, namely the telephone.

  * The agricultural metaphor is therefore neither necessary nor appropriate for this description of the social shaping of a new medium. The metaphor is both obsolete and too general and is not fitted to the specifics of the context.
  * The repetition of forms, genres and components, the adaptation of these elements to the changing context of reception, is a core aspect of the social shaping of a new medium.

  * However, the question of adaption to the changing context of reception, the specific context"
" Very often they are not published at all or only in tiny editions, the review copy being sold at very high prices on bookseller’s racks. There are, however, a few rare exceptions. 

At the moment the review form has been in existence since the fifteenth century. Originally reviews were intended to be private communications between readers and writers, but they quickly assumed a function which was comparable to that of a newspaper article – namely, to contribute to the sales of books reviewed. From the sixteenth century reviews came into existence which also tried to establish their reputations by claiming a length. At the end of the 17th century an institution has appeared which would test authors or books for its readers; an institution with the function of checking that books are good books. This institution has since then existed side by side with the review.

The critical literary periodical was founded by Knut Borchgrevink in 1866. It became a serious journal with a regular appearance of reviews. Borchgrevink had already taken a position on the question of reviews’ length. Later review periodicals have followed a more liberal line, although still with a regular appearance of review copies of books only published in small editions. In modern times the review has lost the function of contributing to the sales of books; but it is still used to present literary or technical subjects of interest to a general public with a special knowledge.

In the first half of the twentieth century literary reviews were more"," In short, the circumstances which make review-writing difficult and which make it so difficult tend to make it unique. 

The reviewer must be capable of giving a short, punchy account of a book, of writing concisely, of not devoting too much time to a single book, but of also being able to take time to consider and give context to multiple books, of not being a didactic, but rather enabling readers to engage with the books he reviews, of being accessible to the reader, of evoking both emotion and thinking, and above all of being, above all of being fair, of remaining objective and not descending into personal attack.

Reviewing begins with finding the book, or books, to review. Finding a book which appeals to you is essential, as it will lead to the next step: reading the book, preferably on the cheap in a public library or on the internet, and finding a copy. Only then is the reviewing process ready to begin. You will need to read the book, perhaps spending time on specific pages or chapters or even sections, to find out if what you are reading is worth reviewing. At this stage you can use the resources available on the internet to help you. There is nothing like getting a fresh opinion. 

On finishing the book, you then need to assess its merits in terms of being worthwhile reading for the reviewer or for the reader, and its faults. You need to do your best to stay fair, to be"," What does this mean? It means that most literary critics tend to value reviews because they can be written as, and then just dropped like so many leaves. Most of them do not really intend them to be permanent fixtures in the literary historical record. They are, to use the technical term of literary criticism, “performative”. To be performative is to take part in a performance, do something “for the crowd”, to put it in a more popular usage. What this means in more practical terms is that the critical act of reviewing, of critic and reader engaging in a conversation about a book, takes place outside of time and memory; and also outside of the reader’s conscious intentions and purposes. The critic writes, the reader reads, but neither intended nor expected the review to remain. This may go some way to explaining why the literary critic’s reputation has been so resilient through periods of what might be called cultural “crisis”. The reason is that reviews were not supposed to survive, so if they did survive they had a double advantage: they offered a new and attractive way of making a living for the literary critic in a period when money was very tight for many and offering some guarantee of value to the client, the reader. Reviews have always had a double role. The first is that of a review of the book, so the reader can find out whether a book is good, whether it is worth reading, and, by implication, whether the reviewer thought so. The second"," They will usually have their first criticism at school; or more usually at university; they will be in a review journal for a year or so before they get an editor’s appointment; they will be printed occasionally in literary magazines and then forgotten until suddenly reappearing a year or two after this in a literary history or survey of reviews, which will be read with interest - but not really understood. And it is in the nature of the business that they cannot survive on the page, except in the case of those few literary journals that have realised and built up a substantial archive of classics in review.

There are many virtues in this brief sketch of the reviewer’s lot, but the one I should like to dwell upon is that reviews are written quickly, and so, by the author’s intention, badly. They are to a review writer what theatre directions are to a stage director: they explain what the play is about in a handful of sentences. To write a good review takes a great deal of practice: you need to have worked in the profession for many years before you are allowed even to think of writing one. But there is another advantage: reviewers are often people who would not naturally do the work: they are in fact the “outs”. They are critics: and critics don’t do the reviewing. Reviewers are often specialists; reviewers are usually generalists. Reviewers are people who like to talk about their own work, whereas the reviewing requires a good deal of silence."," This makes them a very special and rare thing. As a reviewer, I’ve found myself in these circumstances more than once; and the more often I write the more I realise how remarkable it is. As I’ve already mentioned, I’ve also written a book on how to write a good book review. Here are its opening lines: Frank Kermode Reviews: An Essay in Criticism 

I’ve been wondering, what is it that makes a review special? Reviewers claim that a review is “rare” in comparison to other types of writing, and they point to the ephemeral nature of written works in general. Reviews claim to be the “most effective way to engage with the work,” since they are “written with the sole purpose of making someone look at a book in a different way.” However, from my own point of view, reviews are quite easy to write, as they are merely a summation of the main points from which I benefit, and making this claim is itself an extraordinary thing to claim. Moreover, the ability to write a review that is “written with the sole purpose of making someone look at a book in a different way” is not particularly difficult, as many other, simpler kinds of writing do precisely this. What makes reviews so extraordinary is not how hard they are to write, nor how much effort they consume, but that they are written in an exceptional way, that is a very rare thing to do. 

What"," What are review-writers trying to achieve and what are the particular skills and abilities they need to employ to produce these short, crisp and incisive statements? Kermode talks with several writers about what reviewing is actually like and how they approach it.

Reviews are rarely anything other than a passing reference to a text. But they are an important way for students, scholars and the public to assess the quality of a book and its creator. So much so that they have become a vital tool in funding and reviewing new titles. Yet even the best reviews are unlikely to reach the heights of poetry or Shakespeare. 

How reviews are produced is also a part of the mystery. Reviewers of books are not just writers but also librarians, archivists and other specialists in their field. Kermode describes how one literary critic has been particularly helpful to a historian of ideas, having written several highly regarded reviews of recent books. 

Reviewers rely on specific cognitive skills and abilities, but it is the combination of these with an understanding of writing techniques and the appropriate use of vocabulary that allows them to produce the crisp, incisive and memorable statements that define them as reviewers. 

At the start of each review the text needs to contain the name of the author, the title and the date of publication (but not the page number). Kermode suggests the review text should follow this pattern:

Author/Title/Date
This is an outstanding book. The"," Reviews live and die by the quality of the language which they are written in. But what is language? To understand language it is necessary to know grammar, semantics and pragmatics which in turn require an understanding of how the language is used in the world - its history and social context. Reviews tend to be written by those who are unfamiliar with the field being reviewed or even the reviewer themselves. Hence most reviews have to make a fairly general statement of a case, sometimes supported by historical and contextual evidence - in essence a summary of the argument of the review. It is through the mechanism of summary that the critical element of language -the combination of diction, style and syntax- is brought into the review.

But a review-writer will also need to be able to express their personal reaction to the work being reviewed. Hence another device is required to combine diction, style and syntax with a personal reaction. And here we arrive at what I believe is the key to review-writing: the combination of a fairly general summary of the argument with personal reaction. The language we use to express the summary and personal reaction is the language of the argument. We express the argument in terms of the following grammatical patterns: ‘descriptions’, ‘assertions’, ‘characterisations’, ‘illustrations’ and so forth. The patterns are used in different forms - ‘description’ can take the form of a declarative ‘as per’, ‘assertion’ can take the form of an imperative"
" For Welles, the film was always about what had gone before: in particular, what had gone before a similar American story about a charismatic and arrogant king, William the Last. The key figure in this story was Charles Foster Kane, played by John Barrymore, a US ambassador to France who was a widower at the beginning of the narrative. Kane is presented as the most eligible bachelor in America but is rejected by the women of his time. They blame the women for his frigidity. It is women’s business to keep his attention and, when they fail, it is the end of civilization.

In Kane’s day, he is also America’s most famous and popular writer, and indeed his last major work was a novel whose title and author were revealed late in the film (although only to himself). Kane’s ambition is to overthrow the last of the royal families, the so-called Gilded Age, by marrying a commoner, his neighbour Ebb Tide. Kane himself has the makings of a king. He has charm, looks, personality and wealth. He is brilliant, courageous, has an eye for beauty and is a skilled politician. The difference with him is the difference between light and shadow. He is a cipher, and yet he is not so much a cipher as he is the expression of what America is, of its hopes and dreams and fears.

The film follows Kane’s rise to power in the mid"," He went to the studio (CBS); CBS said “no” and Welles went to the RKO studio in Mexico and persuaded them to make it; RKO would not let him make it so he quit his job and went to the studio for help (Charles Koestler), the studio said “no” and Welles went to the studio and did it. So, here is a film that is, in one of its main scenes, set on an estate (Hearst), that is so famous that it is named after its owner. In an unusual (and illegal) twist of fate, Hearst is represented by a maid (Mabel Norma Walker). Welles is a journalist hired by the Hearst corporation to write a biography of the man, who is portrayed as a psychopath and a killer. He is obsessed with his own reputation, his control of the media, and as a war correspondent during the Great War (World War I) he saw violent action and is forever scarred. When another journalist, (Jeffrey Hunter), is discovered in a compromising situation with another woman and goes to tell the “dear one” what has happened the former mistress of the dead man (played by MacDonald) strikes back. Hearst has the journalist murdered (shot in the back of the head) and when he dies his wife (Helen Gahagan) reveals to the police (Welles is the police) that he (Hearst) has been responsible","

Its central character, Orson Welles, is best known for his Mercury Theatre broadcast in May 1938 of Welles’s adaptation of the novella The War of the Worlds, in which Welles’s fearless (to put it charitably) impresario Kane (his alter ego) is persuaded to take the radio’s aliens, who want only to enslave mankind, on a tour of the world. It is not a convincing adaptation. Nor is it convincing that in the decades after its initial broadcast it had a profound effect on modernist art, literature, film-making and social mores. In fact, there is only superficial connection between the text of The War of the Worlds and what eventually became Citizen Kane. Kane’s world, the film industry and its values, and a host of other social and artistic issues were all well trodden ground before Welles’s script arrived. What Citizen Kane does represent is one of the most creative and entertaining re-enactments of the modern metropolis, and the way in which it was realised: the filming of sound on location, the use of multiple camera angles and shots, and a remarkable soundtrack are what made it memorable. 

Citizen Kane’s success was due to its popularity amongst the small group of radio listeners who were also avid movie fans. It was well received by critics and quickly became the number one movie in America. Welles is said to have been disappointed that Hearst"," He had not yet learned the difference between a narrative and a non-narrative film. He was a neophyte cinephile with a genius for getting people to pay to see his films. The film’s production is fairly well documented, though largely on Hearst’s (fictional) behalf. The first thing Welles did was write the screenplay from memory. He was given credit and then fired from the project without a penny. When the money came through, Welles hired a first-rate cinematographer and a set decorator, but still had to scrimp to find grips and a few extras to appear in various scenes. So it was no great feat to film this film in a single shot from start to finish. And for all its narrative flair, it is in many ways a rather primitive film. It uses real newsreels to illustrate its story. It is shot on a very low budget. And despite all Welles’s efforts to build a grandiose sense of the film’s themes and references, the message is relatively banal. This is not to suggest that Welles was without merit. I would agree with some of what he said about the film and the news and media. But he was a flawed man. He was also the son of a famous American newspaper publisher, an experience that moulded him and gave him the confidence, ambition and energy that led him to filmmaking. Like his father, Orson"," His friend and the movie's producer, Samuel R. Rothstein, was more cautious and asked for a deferment from the draft for Welles’s services in the production. To his chagrin, Welles was rejected and spent two years as a member of the US Army Signal Corps preparing films for the War Department. His return was a critical and popular success with the movie’s second release. The film is an extraordinary achievement and Welles has many claims to his success. First and foremost, he was born into wealth, although its exact provenance is a matter of debate. It is likely that much of the wealth emanated from the newspapers and media of his father, William Randolph Hearst. He was a force of nature, one who, by any standards, had the power of a god. His will was an iron will and he was a brilliant manipulator of humans, a combination that led him to amass the enormous fortune that he amassed. He ran his newspapers and media organizations as if they were gigantic businesses, with well-crafted marketing strategies and a keen interest in logistics and supply lines. In this, he was simply following the trends in American business that were in vogue in the 1920s and 1930s. This resulted in the famous ‘Hearst Empire’ which was characterized by its vertical structure, with media companies, newspapers, magazines, etc. all part of a vast organization that extended from California to Spain and Africa. It was this organization"," At the time he felt it was the thing to do to give American artists a creative outlet at a time when most of them were producing anti-intellectual propaganda. Some would say he made a mistake but in retrospect it is clear that had he realised just how much he was going to be stopped in his tracks by the Hollywood machine he would never have got off with it. In many ways it would have been better if he had made another film. This one was so successful, and gave such an impression of the possibilities of cinema, that his career has never really recovered. He was, of course, the mastermind behind The War of the Worlds, one of the most widely watched television broadcasts in history. This led to the filmisation of The War of the Worlds with Steven Spielberg’s famous special effects. The New York Times famously called it “the most frightening movie of all time”. That, though, is another matter and one that will probably require another sequel – or perhaps a rebooted version. Some will no doubt argue it’s been done before. But, in all probability, it will not be done again. It is one of those films that lives on through multiple iterations. It will always be famous for its production design – which was actually accomplished using a single set that doubled for two New York boroughs – and its theme tune, which remains a fan favourite. Some people still sing it to this day. It is a good bet that there will never be"," Citizen Kane, a drama about a media titan who rises from nothing to fame and wealth through media manipulation and exploitation, was a huge surprise hit, running for nearly three hours on New York’s flagship network and eventually becoming one of the most popular and influential movies of all time. 

Citizen Kane refers to American novelist, businessman, and political figure William Randolph Hearst (born William Randolph Lester). Citizen Kane was Orson Welles's first motion picture. Orson Welles always maintained that its success arose from his having no idea of what he was or wasn't allowed to do: he just went ahead and did it.

" The Reformation had opened the way for a new style of worship which made worshipping on Sundays a habit – something previously done irregularly or never at all. Sundays now became ordinary days for church attendance in order to make Sundays more regular in keeping with the weekly pattern of the Bible. For people without a Sunday church the provision of food is a more acceptable excuse to skip breakfast. This transition from no breakfast to a well-rested and energized morning happened pretty quickly but the pace of change was decelerated significantly due to the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the subsequent two world wars. 

The significance of breakfast for health is now well established. People who eat breakfast have lower BMI, better cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure than people who skip breakfast. People who consume breakfast are less likely to be hungry at night and more likely to have a full night’s sleep. In addition, breakfast stimulates digestion, increases metabolism and helps people to feel fuller for longer.

This is where the English breakfast comes into it. Originating in Devon and Cornwall, it was brought to London by railwaymen on the morning of their arrival, thus it became established overnight. The main feature of the English breakfast is that it should be eaten between 7am and 9am so that a good start to the day is made. Eggs, bacon, toast, black pudding, sausages and beans on toast are the staples of the English breakfast although the most adventurous will add"," However the Tudors were notoriously frugal by comparison with other periods. More importantly perhaps was the Reformation in England which brought into question many of the faith's outmoded moral precepts and led to a search for truth and godliness. These ideas were expressed in the 16th century in the development of the English Renaissance. It was through the Renaissance that a renaissance in reading was achieved, knowledge of classical literature revived and a re-discovery of ancient Greek philosophy led to the development of the Experimental method of learning. This new approach encouraged learners to question and test their beliefs against facts. A consequence of this was the rise of the empiricist who were advocates of observational learning and the rejection of the rationalist approach of the rationalists in favour of the more empirical one. The empiricists believed that learning was best accomplished by observing and experiential methods such as practical exercises in daily life. So the rise of the empiricist coincided with the rise of the breakfast revolution. This in turn led to the growth of the British Empire and a global spread of its ideals. The spread of British ideals of good living and the breaking of the fast were undoubtedly important factors. But perhaps the most important factor of all was the development of new trading posts in the Americas which would lead to the rapid spread of the British Monarchy’s ideals across the planet.

Afternoon Tea: A British import The popularity of afternoon tea, or 'tea time' as"," There is little evidence that food was shared in the medieval period other than through family or household, and a medieval household was unlikely to provide for more than one or two persons so it is more likely the introduction of the printing press to the English language and the growing population which led to more people reading and the availability of new foods. By the 16th century the consumption of breakfast had firmly taken root and the English diet became largely based around this meal. The English Breakfast  - two kinds of bread, a piece of meat, a piece of cheese, a pint of beer and bread orbutter.  This was a meal which would see many topping up from their pint of beer in the morning. In the early part of the 18th century John Payne an English merchant living in Amsterdam became so fed up with the state of the English breakfast that he wrote a highly critical book of the subject called ‘An Essay towards a Real Character of the English Breakfast’.  He lambasted its staple components; cold meats and thick slices of dry bread with margarine or butter.  He went on to describe English breakfasting as barbarous as any people on earth did it and urged that they get on with inventing a proper English breakfast.  The book did little to change the general English breakfasting tradition but the book did sell well and it is fair to say that John Payne had his point across.  The English had been guilty of breakfasting with no thought or consideration for a meal and the consequences"," It is clear that both meat and bread were central to the English breakfast however in later years it had turned into a rather heavy meal with a lot of bread. In the 18th century the British started experimenting with other ingredients including eggs, bacon and mushrooms. At first it was considered bizarre but now it is regarded as a normal part of a breakfast. 

The Flesch Kincaid readability score for this passage is 14.8, categorized as “Easy.”

  * “Breakfast” has a Flesch Kincaid Grade level of “6” as it is not a unfamiliar term.
  * The passage is composed of a history of breakfast which is not especially difficult.
  * Although breakfast has become more prevalent in England in the last two centuries, it was not commonplace. However, the passage indicates that breakfast has become the norm rather than the exception.
  * The passage mentions that breakfast had turned into a heavy meal with a lot of bread. The passage does not indicate that breakfast was light or that it featured few or no bread, merely that breakfast had become a heavier meal than previously the case.
  * The passage mentions that breakfast had turned into a “rather heavy meal” due to the increasing availability of food, indicating that the change was not due to the food itself but rather the fact that there was more of it available to eat and, as such, it featured more heavily in the breakfast.
  * Finally, the passage"," Others are even more enigmatic suggesting a more favourable climate. But whatever the reason the sixteenth century saw a steady rise in the frequency of breakfast with cookery books beginning to appear alongside the spread of education.   

By 1770, John Hill, one of the first cooks to use modern methods including gas stoves and an icebox had stated the importance of breakfast for good digestion. By the mid-nineteenth century breakfast was so ingrained into British society it was celebrated in song. “A morning meal is better than royalty; And though I starve, I ne’er can tire; I crave for breakfast when I’m hungry now.”  While breakfast was being established in the industrial revolution it was also undergoing significant change in the early years of the twentieth century. “There seems to be a growing disillusionment with breakfast, even amongst the more discerning classes,” declared The Tablet. “Where once there was an appetite for the full-scale meal it now appears there is a desire only for the toast and egg.” 

The speed with which breakfast changed in the early years of the century has led one historian to suggest that “the breakfast craze was the last great social revolution of the early twentieth century.” 

A further development in the century leading up to World War II was the proliferation of take-aways which would later go on to become the national obsession they are today.   However it would be a century after the end of"," William Temple in 1604 commented “There is now a great variety of good and wholesome meats and drinks, more convenient and frequent than ever was the case in the age of kings, so that now there is no prince that dines alone”. In contrast in ancient Rome the elite ate breakfast while most could afford only quick food in the evening. Although the Victorian breakfast was more substantial than the English breakfast of milk, cereals and bacon which would be considered light by modern standards, this was still a fairly limited menu. By the late nineteenth century this had expanded with eggs being featured, but in the first decades of the twentieth century the menu was still limited with only milk, bread and butter and coffee or tea being available as first drinks. It is unlikely the reader has ever seen milk coming out of a cow, much less tasted it. The arrival of margarine in the 1920s changed all this, however the advent of aeroplanes in the second world war, and subsequent war effort was beginning to transform breakfast. The end of the war led to the expansion of breakfast and a further change with the arrival of television breakfast TV shows became increasingly popular. Soon every weekend day morning there was a “breakfast programme” which would showcase cereals, bacon, sausages, eggs, beans, beans, toast and a drink. As a nation we are now famed for our breakfasts however the British public had one final transformation in 1966 when instant coffee was introduced. Initially instant coffee was very expensive"," The growing population and improved communications meant that there was now an ever-increasing amount of food to eat and cook and servants to serve it. With previously obligatory three meals a day now becoming the norm a breakfast no longer had to be substantial to fuel an individual for the rest of the day. Inevitably the availability of a variety of foods to eat from and the convenience of such made this a logical choice for most people. This development meant that breakfast was now considered an essential meal, not merely a dietary convenience. 

Breakfast was now the focus of many a culinary activity. It was eaten as a light meal or even a light meal, which was still seen as a substantial meal, with bread, butter, cereals, fruits, sometimes eggs and often coffee, in the morning. In many ways the spread of breakfast eating customs became the ‘siesta’ in Spain. 

Food prepared for breakfast had to be hot in the early morning but this didn’t have to be an unattractive meal and could be light and lively like a buffet supper or a full English breakfast. 

England’s breakfast revolution

As we have seen breakfast was becoming more regarded as the norm rather than the exception in the sixteenth century although it was often eaten cold. It was no longer a heavy meal with substantial amounts of food but a light meal with items that could be picked from the dining table. 

Now breakfast could now be eaten it was considered an essential meal for"
