He has taken the rank of robber, but has never been able to fight. One day Einon's father got his child and asked him to take care of him. In an angry tone, he blamed his father for being irresponsible. He had no patience or care for Einon despite his fear of danger. When Einon woke up in the morning, he refused to fight. He felt a bit embarrassed. His father had told him his goal was to be the Old Code knight. This day Einon's teacher named Bea recited the Old Code to him. The teacher asked his son to tell Einon what was happening. This prompted Einon to do his best to learn the code. He learned to fight by practicing.","Einon was born with a head full of worms. To fight with his head, Einon threw him into the ring of worms. At this time, Einon had little to do but eat to keep from getting sick. When he got to the ring, Einon threw the worms and fell from the tree. He fell on the tree stump and was found dead in the forest. The kings, princes and knights then tried to keep the old code for years. When the old code was made, the knights told Einon that he was an old knight. The knights finally succeeded and Einon was saved.","Einon was a hardened criminal who could not use his magic to break things. There was no chance he would ever succeed, until an old priest told Einon to take the fight seriously. He learned the fighting with his head and head. Einon could not let his fear of losing his heart entrail him.",Einon was a great fighter and thought he was a good fighter. He did not believe that the old code was used to train people.

A2,In 12000 BC people in the Middle East were moving all the time to find food. They began to grow food. Before people started farming they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers.,People began farming about 12000 years ago. At first people would go to the forest to find plants or fruit they could eat. But when people first started farming they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat.

These people were the first farmers.,About 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. Their only place to grow food was the forest. They went to the hay for food. They were moving all the time to find the food they needed. During the last centuries people were farmers. They were pioneers in farming.,People in the Middle East once were very much familiar with their environment. They ate what they could afford and took their vegetables to eat. But about 12000 years ago they began to grow food in the Middle East. They were the first farmers.,It was about 12000 years ago. The first farmers built a windmill. They planted some trees in their gardens to keep the fruit and vegetables fresh. But most people did not have any access to a source of fruits to plant or eat. The climate remained cold and dangerous - there were no people with trees to raise crops in the area. They could only have picked at certain times of day and night to grow crops. The farmers were likely to be unsatisfied.,"The Middle East was the first country in Africa. The first farmers did not know of their origins in agriculture or were not allowed to grow anything for a living. There were no land hills and mountains and forests. Eventually there was no way for the people to grow food and therefore they didn't survive any longer. The farmers were not able to support themselves from the water or the soil. They also tried to acclimate themselves to the changing environment. They built houses with doors to make their houses more stable and secure. This is how many years ago in the Middle East people started to grow food, and they were the first farmers.","The Middle East sat in the middle of the Mediterranean in the middle of the Middle Ages. In 12000 BC there was a strong mercantile movement. Many of the people took part in the harvest, such as a woman and her son, to harvest or harvest the crops. The people were moving all the time, which was to be difficult, as they didn't have enough room for food. Now farmers were growing food that farmers could sell in the market. The Middle East is not the only place in the Middle East where farmers are working with food. The middle East was famous for growing crops such as apples, bananas, and kiwi. In Central Asia in the Middle East, there was a strong confluence of cultures in the West and in other places. Most cultures took part in the harvest. One of these cultures, Zhouji, was the first to grow apples. This brought food to the people and farmers, and allowed them to have food they could eat. In the middle of the Middle East, there was a strong trade in wheat, beans, and other crops to feed their slaves. The main agricultural revolution was in Egypt, where the first farmers turned to agriculture."
A2,"One day, we go to the ice fishing spot in Canada. We can see the small houses being made of wood and building some kind of houses. On this day, we're surprised to find there are so many big houses! It's hard to imagine it happening every week! But, as we've been to every other lake in the world, this is one of the local sights, especially on the ice. The place looks like it's been frozen out in the snow. The place is full of people, and you can see that the area is hot when it starts to look like it's freezing. They make their own houses, and sometimes people just sit inside. So, this is what they do to catch the fish!","This is an interesting story about children swimming under water. On a hot summer day, most of the people are still swimming. However, a strange thing happens to one of their scuba divers. They find that they can't make any progress. The scuba divers decide to swim slowly away from their bodies while the water slowly warms up to their right side. If they fall back to the bottom, they slowly sink to their sides and begin to swim. The scuba divers then try to float over the water so that the scuba divers can see them. This way, the scuba divers know they have sunk and have swum out to the surface. This makes the scuba divers more likely to come back to their body.","Lake Nipissing has become ice and Canada's people spend three hours fishing on the lake. They build little houses on the ice, decorate them, and swim. At the start of a season, Canadian fishermen begin to fish every weekend.","Lake Nipissing is a lake near Canada. The lake covers a huge area. It is covered in ice covered houses. Fish are roosting in the ice. The cottages are very modern and large. They are also large enough to hold big fish. The cottages are all very simple. They are just one dummy cottage. The cottages are in small, icy spots, near ice-covered lakes. A large pond lies over the cottages. The cottages are not too small, so they can accommodate a bigger boat. A migratory boat is not allowed. This is difficult and difficult. The dockyards have a small dock that can hold boats and fishing equipment. They are very easy to find. Most cottages have little fishing boats but there are many. They often fish in the lake during the winter. One small fishing boat is used, but they do not catch any fish.",A fishing village is a small village near Lake Nipissing in the Lake Nipissing Municipality in Manitoba. Many of the little houses in the icehouses were built by locals and fishermen who came to catch fish. One of the little houses is covered in a colourful pattern. The small fish have a green color and are shaped like tiny houses made of green paint or wooden blocks. One woman found a small pot filled with seeds and she took a plastic container to pick it up. Each week thousands of fishermen build their houses in the icehouses to catch fish.,"This is a beautiful lake and its beautiful colours remind us of nature. But, at Lake Nipissing, there are many things to do except for the snow. If you decide to drive north from Toronto, you will have to do some skiing. The lake becomes ice and thousands of fishermen travel there each weekend. You are lucky because the ice is so large you can only see one side of the lake. This is what they do with the little houses. Then you sit inside and catch the fish that swim under the ice.","I drive from Toronto to Lake Nipissing. The lake becomes ice, and thousands of fishermen play ice-fishing around it. The lake becomes ice when the fishermen paint their houses with bright colours. This helps them catch the fish that swim underneath the ice. In the lake there are some lakes that have ice houses on them, and several lakes that are ice-fishing places. In the winter the lake becomes ice and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend."

I had a long-term memory about it after college. One summer, the corn was being grown by an animal shelter. I was not a farmer but a farmer because the farm was very big and there was a large amount of corn. I kept the corn warm and started making a cinnamon corn bread. Then I learned that my foot had an effect on my brain. The big man suddenly became scared of his foot. I quickly explained to him the damage it was causing. He stopped at a table and stopped eating. I walked back outside, but a frightened man saw me rushing down the street. I then got up and shouted out, ""I heard him walking in the corn!!"".

A2,"D Brown wanted to take his holiday in December. He did not want to spend his holiday on the beach. So he asked if he could help out on Saturday. I told him he wished he could work on Wednesday. He could do anything on Monday. The holiday begins at 1 a.m.. If I get the correct time, I will make arrangements.","It is a sunny day and there is a storm coming in from outside. We need to bring in a blanket on the ground to protect the trees. It takes a lot of pressure to bring in a blanket on the ground. However, the storm did not last long.

He said it was not an important day for the tree so we would go outside and take a blanket. Several people in our group were gathered and gathered around the snow. We were putting together blankets for a blanket to move in the snow. Then the snowman started to start falling on the snow-covered ground. We went outside to help out the snow-covered trees. He threw the blankets out the window, grabbed a blanket and threw it in the snow for his blanket. When the snowman came out to help him lay down, the blankets hung on the wood. We made our snow-covered floors a safety net to help break the tree. The snowstorm started to fall. Eventually, all of the snow fell down and the trees were all bare. We did a big, heavy storm. I stayed inside and waited for the snowman to come to the snow-covered ground. The snowman slipped through a window to help it fall. He couldn't see anything. We tried to put the blankets down but nothing had worked. He was still there and saw the snowman. He tried to keep the snowman's head buried in the snow. He had to wait several more minutes.

The snowman was nowhere to be seen. Then it snowed again. I saw the snowman fell in the snow. We did a small snowman's face as he fell down the snowman's face. We sat outside for about ten minutes to help save the snowman's life. We had very little snow and then the snowman disappeared.","D Brown was a senior at the university.

A2,"As the 18th century rolled on, there was a lot of activity in horse racing. The modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. The horses had a tendency to do the same thing around the world. A famous horse trainer from Europe told her in a book a year ago that horses should be a sport. She told me that horse racing is a part of a life cycle, a physical activity. So, the author shows us that horses and horse racing have played a huge part in race history. A horse jockey from Central Asia was a favourite in the 18th century. A modern horse jockey came to Europe in the 12th century.",There are many important stories about horse racing. From the first books ever written it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. The first horses raced in Central Asia around 4500 years ago. The first modern horse racing began in Europe in the 12th century.,"Until now, horses have only been allowed in a horse stable. As the centuries went by, horses and horses were becoming more commonplace. In Europe, horses were able to race on horses, but since horse racing was a highly lucrative activity, it was not the only fun. In 1915, horses were allowed to race in a horse stable, where they earned the nickname of Horses of the Arabian Sea. Horses racing has always been an important sport, and horse racing has always been an important sport in both Greek and Roman times. Horses racing began as a racing event in a horse stable in East Asia. In modern times, horses have become competitive and there have been many successes in European horse races.","In the 1600's a racer spotted the horses that had been bred for race horses. Despite their age they were not able to race for fun or to arouse their sense of adventure. After having a horse a few years back the owners of the horses wanted to recreate the game to see if the horses could take on a challenge. The horses raced as much as four hundred ft and three hundred pounds, with some jumping as high as four hundred and fifteen feet. The first historical book ever written was ""The History of Horse Racing"". The book featured some early history that tells of the history of horse racing. The most interesting part of the book is that the horse races as closely as possible from the 1600's to around 1600. This book is very detailed with a simple story, the main horse races of the day being the race of horses. There are many different forms of horse racing, but horse racing is more of a sport as it takes place around 100 years ago, in the early 1900's. By now a lot of horses have been turned into horses as well as cows. There have been many more advanced races and the popularity is growing.","A horse racing team is a group of riders of horses. The first horse racing book, the Horse Racing dynasty, introduced the horse racing system in the 10th century. Unlike many horse racing books, the Horse Racing dynasty was introduced 4 500 years ago and began to attract horses and racing horse riders by the 1800s. Nowadays most horse racing in Europe is mostly organised by horses rather than horse races. Because horses like horses are considered a valuable commodity in sport, the traditional racing format is similar to that of horse racing. The Horse Racing Federation (HFR) has organized horse racing for nearly 7,000 years in Europe and the UK. The horse racing tradition was started in Italy in 1795. Horse racing in Europe began in the 13th century. Today the horse racing industry is in the 21st century with new horse racing teams taking over the industry.","The earliest books of the history of horse racing were written before the first era of horse racing. The earliest one was written in 3000 BC. The earliest horse racing books were written in 1680 BC. Most of the history of horse racing began in the middle of the 8th century. The first modern horse racing began in Africa around 4000 BC. Many more ancient and historic book of horse racing were written in the 12th century. Many of the history of horse racing began in Central Asia, around 4500 BC.","The history of horse racing came to the United States in the 1870s. It started in Central Asia about 4500 years ago and was considered a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Its history began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. From the history of horse racing, we find that horse racing was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. The story then sums up the history of horse racing."

A2,Fiona Lever is a very accomplished dancer. She has trained her entire life and even taught at a local dance school. She has recently completed a five-year course in line dancing and is currently a full-time volunteer teacher at the club. She is now hoping to learn a lot from her class. Fiona has been learning a lot since she was an age a year ago and it is an exciting time for her.,"When Fiona and Fiona are about to leave school, Fiona has decided to play line dancing. She has always been scared of dancing and is keen to learn. When Fiona is four, she tells her about her favourite line dancing spot. Fiona says the club is one of the best places in the country. Fiona tells her how her first goal is to reach the coveted target. She says that as young as she is, she will become a professional dancer. Line dancing has been gaining popularity around the country, but not everyone in Britain is into it. There is a class for anyone interested in learning to dance, and I'm sure a school can help make that easier.","Tittles and dancing class is popular in Britain. For over two weeks, the class has been offering classes in dance and other activities for children around the country. When you join the class, you get to meet the teachers and show up to a dance with a group of friends. When you leave the dance class, the group of kids that dance on their feet will ask you to leave their chairs if you don't want to be there. When you leave the dance class, you are given a gift: a line dancer whose feet you can't walk, so you are able to dance. The line dancer makes the class very interactive and you are invited to join in. You can then practice your moves with other children that can help with the group dancing, even if you aren't a dancer.","Thousands of people have a new hobby — line dancing. In almost every town you will find clubs and classes for this new activity. But what if you were just doing the routine on the streets and you still couldn't walk? Fiona Lever, a class leader, explains the problem is that her students don't have any feet and you still have to do a very long run to get on. At school, though, Fiona told a few parents about their idea of dancing. When I started out, her teachers were told that people with only two feet can be at this dance class and there were plenty of teachers in her town. It's all just so different. It's great for people who want to learn a new choreography or just a lot of exercise. But Fiona's mother urged her to go to one or other club in the town so that she could train on her skills.","People in every town in England enjoy line dancing. But when you meet people who are also line dancing, you might be interested. If you have 2 feet and can walk, then you will probably be a good candidate for line dancing. There are groups of all ages with different groups and if you have the right time for this, then there are classes for everyone. It's fun and you can join groups and get involved in the group. But not everyone is ready for this. Often, people have the wrong shoes or feet, and it's not easy. If your feet and feet can be measured and you want to learn line dancing, then you will be the best person. But, if you have the right foot and the proper moves and you want to learn line dancing, then line dancing is the way to go.",Fiona is learning line dancing.,Fiona wanted to be an Olympic runner so she joined a gymnastics club in Liverpool and went to a line dance class in New York City. She was pleased to find that there were a lot of new people in the city. Fiona is not a first timer. She has a fear of heights that people will find hard to find. So in her first class Fiona shows how to balance on her feet and dance. The runner takes about two feet off the floor to try out some lines.

A2,One day they found a dinosaur hiding near a cemetery. It was the second dinosaur to be found outside of the cave. Now nobody knows why it was there. Dinosaurs had never lived before they were spotted in caves in Europe.,I was a kid at a high school. We all enjoyed our time together on the playground. One day I saw a dinosaur eating lunch. It wasn't like I was a kid at school. It was amazing to see that there was no such thing as a dinosaur.

Dinosaurs were very large, and they had a very distinctive skin. Because there are so many dinosaurs there are many living descendants of dinosaurs. However, there is a problem with their appearance. The sun, and the moon, was the source of all the light around the sun. If there is one way that a planet can shine in the sun, dinosaurs would do it. In this lesson, dinosaurs don't look like some other creatures because they're not the same as other animals.","When dinosaurs first came into existence, the air in their body was cloudy. Then a huge cloud cover of fog formed over the surface. As a result, the air became cold. The next dinosaur appeared that day and died. There are now no dinosaurs on earth.","A little girl named Helen, who has always dreamed of dinosaurs, asked her grandfather to design a new model of dinosaurs so she could see how it would look like one day. There were only about 20 of those dinosaurs and they were all in a museum. Helen put a lid on one of them and said that they'd have a great time when they'd had a chance to have a rest. Now, a dinosaur can't be built as the most advanced creatures. The idea behind the design was to see if it could resemble what the other dinosaurs had done before they were all in a museum. The dinosaurs looked different from the other dinosaurs so Helen decided to look for an alternative. The best dinosaurs were all birds. After a lot of effort she figured that dinosaurs would have the ability to have a natural balance.","The last dinosaur went to the moon in a giant ship. After the ship's sank, it became a crater. The next one died about 60 million years ago. The dinosaurs looked a little different that everyone else's but not the people that ate them."

The British people like to go to London and visit their relatives to play sports. What sport does Boyzone like to do? The British like to go swimming in Wales, Ireland and England. The British people like to watch rugby. But boys are very strict with the rules. Unlike the American people, British people have a lot of freedom of movement and competition. Boys in the American Party have the freedom to play soccer. Besides, boys in the British Party also want to play sports.

A2,In the 1700s London had no policemen because most of them were middle class. During this time London had only just a few men for the job. Around 300 years ago London was getting bigger and big.,After centuries of neglect London in the late 15th century was becoming a very dirty city. A group of old men who had no place to protect the streets at night. When they started to get bigger the city was starting to get bigger. In 1700 London had no policemen at all. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was a very dirty city.,"When you arrive in London you will see a lot of policemen. London is filled with old, white people. Now the police will be working with black people that come to work at night. One day London policeman was working by the lane for a patrol in the city centre. He did not know what was going on and when he noticed that the police didnt stop talking to people he went to find out who was behind it. He came to find out what the crime was and how many people had died. As the police arrived to guard the street the young old men would be on hand, some armed with machine guns and many more. The young old men had to hide in a cell at the lane in case the police were to shoot them. After all they had been on duty in day and night and they were never caught by police. They all had to stand behind the policeman and wait for them to pick up the evidence. They also tried to get the young men to help them find the crimes. They had to go the night shift to get help. The old men were not paid well but they did what they did. They had to pay for their time and so they didnt have to go. There were some old criminals who worked in London a few years ago. They were not paid very much by police or in the 1700's or in 1700. The city was starting to get bigger. The older men wanted to bring more policemen to the streets.","The London Police was a unit created in the 1880s to guard the streets in London during World War I.

About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor.","When there were young men in London, they were often called policemen and called in during the day to help stop their own money. Today people are allowed to drive a car along the streets in London because they are young. Many people were poor so they needed to have access to a car when they went to work. Some people were just walking and going to school. Some people died and some had to be evicted because of their poor health. London has changed in the history of the police, which has been praised by some people. The Police has grown into an army.","Since the end of the 1700's and the city was really dirty, the policemen who were there have no one to protect the streets at night. They were paid much more because of the city's growing economy. Today a group of young men and women called themselves the London Police. They usually wear hats. Some of the policemen are the people who work in the police and are called the Detective Inspectors or the Detectives. The detectives have been around for a while. One evening, the man who helped was talking with the policemen and said they were very busy being with people and was talking with them. The man answered that it wasn't about the detectives. There was no one to help, they would rather be with them.","Today London has policemen everywhere. London had no policemen in 1700, but in 1700 in 1700 there were many old men who were not paid very much. Since there were less old men than in 1700, the city was really dirty. Now London is becoming worse, which explains why so many old men kept on protecting the street after night in the city."

A2,Mark and his girlfriend drew up a picture of a parrot. Mark loves parrots and has always enjoyed birds and they're just too cute to be real. He bought a parrot camera to have a photo of and then put it on camera. This bird was so big and long to fit in a small cage. Parrots are mostly domesticated and the birds don't grow in large groups. They're good at chewing insects and their tails are always long. Mark tried to sell the parrot camera but it wouldn't let him take photos.,"Parrots were found in many countries in the West.

They are sometimes a problem for farmers, because they lack a lot of food. They usually live with other birds in their group. Parrots are often the troubled bird, sometimes with great difficulty.","I have been told that parrots are beautiful birds and are important for the health of the wild animals. I have heard many stories about them and they are often compared to other plants. As I look at their beautiful colors and the long tails, I think I may be off on a date. They usually live in groups so they can easily find their way around the country. I also hear they can live in zoos. This can be difficult for farmers, because they are more likely to get sick. However, I'm still very interested to hear more about these birds. The weather is very cold and stormy around the area so my schedule changes drastically. It's very windy and the sun is out. But when I open the tree and go out to look for rain, I get a great view. The next morning, I'm worried that the stormy weather will cause the birds to lose their food because of the rain. I try to keep a close eye out for them.","Birds are rare and very rare in the wild. They have lovely tails and can range from 20 to 250 pounds. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil, Australia and India. Despite their long tails, they live in large groups.",People in Brazil have grown up eating parrots.

On the first day of our trip, we didn't see much of a show. We went to a small square with a seat right next to a stage for people to sit, sit down and watch. When we got there, we had to stand outside. There are many different types of elephants in Thailand and they were really exciting and frightening. We did find a small park and I enjoyed going to a show. I think it's important to see both elephants, otherwise they would likely kill you.",The elephant showed up at our hotel and I told my mom. I thought I'd go to the elephant show myself because we had just stayed at a hotel in Europe. So I was glad to go. I went to a park to see it and thought it was a cool area to relax at. My mom had a very nice elephant show there last year and it was in a very big square. I didn't really care at all about the elephant show. It was actually a bit boring because we were all there but we really enjoyed going there. My parents wanted to get to watch it at home but we did not have a lot of time. We had so much fun. I wish we had gotten tickets and stayed at the hotel to see it.,"I got a free ticket for my family to the elephant show. I thought this park was beautiful. I was right. But it really wasn’t. I figured the elephants were just a bunch of crazy tigers and tiger possums. I was wrong. That afternoon, I headed to a nearby park, to watch the show. I walked around looking for my friends. I took some pictures and dragged them home. And I was happy. And that was when the story began. I was happy, and I was happy. I hope that my friends love it too.","When we arrived, we realized we wanted to see the elephant show instead of the small square in the centre.","I went to Thailand for a beach holiday. We were only interested in the elephant show. I thought about watching it. As we walked around a lot, we were surprised to find a large square with seats right next to a small grassy area. My family and I got to see the elephants perform at this small square."

A2,"Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. It is difficult to reach by foot if you are a beginner. At this point, the Marangu trail is the easiest. There is a bit of snow between each section.","Kilimanjaro is a mountain in south Africa. The height of Kilimanjaro is about three to four miles from the city and is over 4,000 feet above sea level. The average temperature is 97.2°C (319.5°F), and it is 2,000 feet above sea level. The highest elevation on the mountain is 2,036 feet. There are several ways to climb Kilimanjaro. There are three different ways to climb: the Marangu path that takes about two days to climb Kilimanjaro, the Marangu Path that takes about 5 hours to climb Kilimanjaro, and the Marangu Path that takes about 7-8 hours to climb Kilimanjaro. People have climbed Kilimanjaro from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. People often think that the five-kilometre Marangu Path is the easiest way to reach Kilimanjaro, especially if it takes about five days. However, some people think that the Marangu Path is far more difficult and dangerous than the Marangu Path. A new study is underway to compare the Marangu Path and the Marangu Path. People have made a detailed analysis of the Marangu Path. They also asked some experts to look at the Marangu Path which is more affordable and easy to use. As a result of their study, Kilimanjaro is considered the highest mountain in Africa.","People are often nervous about climbing Kilimanjaro, but in the long run they can enjoy it. But their experience has made them learn to climb. We all know how hard it is to get up Mount Kilimanjaro in one hour. What makes Kilimanjaro different from other hiking routes?","Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. It is located off the coast of Africa near the coast of the island of Benin. There are three paths from the coast. One is the Marangu path, which takes about five days and is located on the east coast of Africa. The other one is the Marangu trail, which takes about one day and is located in Benin. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. The other four things that we have talked about in this story are the Kilimanjaro path, the Marangu Path, and the Mau Mau Path. The Mau Mau path is the most popular path for people from 7 to 87 years old.","A six-year-old boy named Marangu is climbing Kilimanjaro. Although it takes him up to 8 hours to climb it, he still has the time to set foot on the mountain. Everybody wants to come and see the mountain, and there are several possible routes to a mountaintop. Some people say this path is best for beginners, while some people think it's too dangerous to be on the climb. We try our best to write a story based on the facts in the story.","Mount Kilimanjaro is a remote mountain in northern Africa. In Africa, Kilimanjaro is a rugged hill which climbs through jungles, mountains and the deserts. Several people have climbed Kilimanjaro from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. The five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest, although it takes about five days.","The boy had to climb Kilimanjaro without his mom knowing as he had climbed many different mountains in Africa he loved them. While trekking in Africa, he got a glimpse of some of Africas largest mountains and they were like amazing views and this picture blew my mind. I have to give it a thumbs up. This is from the same family who lived in Zimbabwe and they had climbed Kilimanjaro the first time and were both happy with the climb."

By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage.,"Many people visited the Arctic in the summer years to see some of the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few residents had the snow and ice to themselves.

By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage.","It was in the summer to the icehouse in the winter. Before the 80's, the icehouse was a favorite destination in winter and the winter was still hot and dreary. The icehouse closed in 1991. Today in the winter, the people at the icehouse do not have to walk in the snow to see the ice. However, many people in winters like to see the icehouse the way it used to.

The people in it were generally good at traveling, but when the winter began to get cold, the Arctic became a great winter destination. However, in the 1940s, the Arctic got much more of a bad reputation, mainly because it had no precipitation or snowfall.

It was freezing and icy and the only light in the world was there on a night. I had never been there before and I was really excited to see so much! After reading several books that I picked out, I figured this place would be a great opportunity for me! Unfortunately, it turned out to be a disaster! There were plenty of other people on the bike and I would have to ask if they'd go. It was difficult to ask what was going on when I started a trip! When we arrived to the area, there was an interesting culture in the area! It was very cold. My buddy and I found a story behind the event. We stayed on the bike but still got excited that the weather would be dark and cold. Now that we were there, we thought that maybe the temperatures would improve! I decided to go on the trip in the fall. In the spring, my friend, Mike took me to a park where I met Mike and tried to learn how to swim. Mike told me they had to take the ride down. Mike told me that it was only for a few seconds but that all you need to do was to get to the icehouse. It was so peaceful and beautiful. We sailed back to the icehouse and we learned so much. My advice to other people on the way to the Arctic was to go with some of the locals and if you can get to the icehouse or if you can have a look at the icehouse, be aware that it's incredibly hot outside and that you'll have to get wet. In addition, if you're on a sled or a snowmobile, try to stay in the icehouse so that you can see more wildlife than there is snow. If you can get in the icehouse, stay longer, you'll see more people. I think you'll enjoy yourself, if you're willing to go. And of course, there are some other things to see in the winter: the stars, the ice tower, ice cream pies, snow, ice hockey matches, the winter solstice.",The ICEHOTEL went out to the Arctic in the summer and the winters were very hot. There was an abundance of hot ice in the winters. The sun went out early the next day and the cold came during the afternoon. A very bright radial day started and the snow continued to fall. The ice and the sun stopped to melt before the dreaded morning sun.,"The icehouse on the icebound shoreline was built on the North Sea. It was located in the North Sea, south of Sweden. It was hoped that the salt waters would protect its shore from the summer and cold water. But after years of the icehouse being occupied by visitors, the ice had not fully developed. To remedy the shortage of salt, the icehouse replaced the traditional saline lake and septic system and placed the icehouse in one of the most northerly locations of the North Sea. The icehouse is now a state of preservation. Compared to this, the icehouse is less likely to be destroyed because of its reliance on freezing waters."
B1,"Keith had never had his first big winter climb in Scotland. But he knew the weather was better than average for a British mountain. He was not pleased with the result, but was determined to climb it again in his future. It was a hot, dry month and we had a few days before the summer solstice. Then the weather changed again, and they were only a couple weeks away from the Winter solstice. This is my first time climbing Ben Nevis and it was no different.","Keith Hewitt came from the East Coast to the north of Scotland when he decided to climb Ben Nevis. He took his wife on a long, boring trip to the top of England. After leaving Ben Nevis he did some sightseeing and took a walk through Scotland. He was excited to climb the magnificent mountain but worried it would be too snowy for him. He decided to take a hike in the snow. He was very surprised but enjoyed the view, seeing some trees, and people descending Ben Nevis in the distance. He was afraid of having a big climb, but he enjoyed the experience and made it worthwhile. His wife was amazed to see a big snowfall in his area and felt like an accomplished climber. As they were climbing the mountain he made some suggestions, and began to use his skills to develop and climb the mountain.",Keith Hewitt is a climber who is mainly going to climb the mountains of Britain. He loves hiking to the top of Britain. We were visiting family and went on Ben Nevis in a rainstorm. We stopped for a good if not a good if not a bad if butt of the mountain. We climbed the mountain in the early morning.,Ben Nevis is a famous mountain in Scotland. The climate is sometimes very hot and sometimes it doesn't have a lot of air. A climber like Keith Hewitt told his story to be informative.,"Keith Hewitt had been climbing Ben Nevis in a previous year. The climbing was very good, but he had to be flexible, as the temperature was too cold to climb. Getting off the mountain, he swam through the snow with his foot in his right pocket, then the snow started covering his head. He climbed up the north face of the mountain, and waited for the snow to lift off. As we got closer and closer we both saw the mountain rising with the snow. Then we found out he was not so sure about the temperature compared to where he was climbing. So we went up and walked up to Tower Ridge. We then started climbing to the north side of the mountain. On one of the sides, we had just decided to check the temperature, and there were very few people up in the air. It was very hot and cold, so we retraced our route to the top of the mountain, and we were done. We started to descend in about a minute and we were about to see the top again. We made it up the north face and we realized that we weren't alone.","Keith Hewitt went on the climb on Ben Nevis when he was 12 years old. The weather was fine and we were able to climb all the way up to the top. It isn't very cold in the mountains, and it was very easy to get to Tower Ridge for the first time. We had a wonderful time climbing.","Keith and his climbing partner have always enjoyed climbing mountains. So when we decided to climb Ben Nevis they had to give it a try. At first it seemed to be fun, but after two days climbing the mountain, it really seemed to have gone downhill slowly. Then they started to climb the mountain in their cars. But we didn't do anything wrong, but we didn't take much care at all. After this first climb we headed down the mountain to Tower Ridge. We were only one hour and a half before we got to the summit. Then it started to drop cold again, so it was cool when we got to the summit. Once down the mountain, we decided we should have spent the day outside, so we tidied down. In the morning it became dark and the sun was shining. Keith's view was amazing. He climbed up and down the mountain and then went down to Tower Ridge. It was great seeing the sun rise over the mountain."

The aim was to show women a positive side to running. I started to introduce women to running, and they ran my dub. I decided to make the sport more fun for them and encourage them to do so. The dub started to make women feel comfortable and they ran their own runs. It won a gold medal at the 2008 Games.","They were told to bring the women running to meet for a run instead of going to races remo's. I was embarrassed by that, but I was determined to help out. We both took a break from running at a brisk pace. I knew how to use my time to improve my running skills, so I decided to introduce more women to the sport. I gave them training exercises that helped them improve their technique and fitness. I went on to win a marathon and the Dub was established. I ran the race in my neighborhood and also introduced my daughter to running. Now we are encouraging more women to participate in the sport."
B1,The Grass is a perennial garden. The Grasslands are isolated in mountains and have only a few grasses. The Grass is the single flowering plant that can exist in the frozen environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. There are over 9000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. The Grasslands support a wide range of animal life from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions.,Green grasses are extremely dense. The leaves and buds can grow at any temperature and it is possible that green grass will form a bloom by some time in the following year. How many kinds of green grasses are there on the earth?,"A frog or a lone bird swam on a thick sheet of grass. She tried to find a flower to help move about it but didn't have enough grass to give her a flower. She stumbled upon a small flower in the ground and climbed it to gather some grass in the ground. She discovered a small fig tree, a flowering plant that will become evergreen, with no grass on it in that region.","Grass has been around for a hundred years. There are millions of varieties, and many species. Among the best ones are the monodendron of a grass called Thenldorean. Thenldorean grass is the only plant species which can exist on the planet besides the monodendron. So what is the significance to the grass? Grass Grass is probably the most successful living plant on the earth.","Many people don't have a chance to understand a living plant. So what do we get instead? They don't have to know how to read a dictionary, learn how to use a computer, or know anything about plants. The animals on the Earth often live as tiny, tiny plants of tiny flowers. There is one life on the planet that doesn't really need to be covered in water. Grass and weeds in the Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems and in the Atlantic oceans do that perfectly, if it comes to mind. But if there is even one inhabitant, then Grass is the best option.","Grass is a single flowering plant in the world. When you look at it, it may look like a flower or maybe it will grow. At first it seems like it does not grow. It eventually becomes a flowering plant, and eventually the plants grow. So when people think of the plants that grow in Grass, they want to learn about them.",Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world.

B1,A little girl and her mom were traveling down the road from their hometown to the Rocky Mountains. The mountains started in the North-west but the mountains were only a few hundred miles from their centre in more southern areas. The best way to see the rockies is to travel by train.,"Rockies are the first largest land masses in the world. The mountains are positioned close to the center in the north-west and the center in the south. Compared to other mountains the Rockies are much more small and are covered in mountains. The mountains are often called mountains of the north or the Alps but the mountains are located at a far away valley and their elevation is higher. It is easy to explore the Rockies via train as they only require a short distance. The Rocky Mountains are a small, secluded part of the Alps of the world. In the northwest there are more mountains than in the North-west of France. The Rockies are usually in the North, west and center areas of Switzerland. But the mountains and Alps are located in the south. As the Alps are much larger than the Rockies in North America, so the Rocky Mountains are not as big in the north.","After a trip across the Rocky Mountains, Jim and his friend Steve decided to take a train along the western slopes of the rockies. The route started in the north-west of the Rockies and took them about a hundred miles. The journey was made possible by the Rocky Mountains mountain range. Although the mountains are larger than the Alps, the rockies are bigger than the Alps. As they are smaller, they are not as beautiful as the Alps, but much bigger than the Alps. The most enjoyable way to see the Rockies and the Alps is to travel on a train along the west slopes. The Rockies are worth a visit to both Jim and Steve.","Rocky Mountains are long, short and in the middle of nowhere. Most of the landscape you can see is white and dark brown, most of it over a mountain range. But most of the landscape you will find is dark red and blue. The Rocky Mountains are also the most beautiful place to walk in North America. However, some people prefer to travel by train and explore the scenery as a car, instead of foot. Travel by train is very exciting because it leaves you with an endless choice.","There are few places in North America as beautiful as the Rocky Mountains. However, there are great views of the Alps and the Rocky mountains. The Rocky Mountains are a small a few hundred miles from the centre in some southerly areas. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train.","The Rocky Mountains can make you think of some of the wild places in South America. The Rocky Mountains are situated between the Northern and Eastern Plateau. It is located at an elevation of 2,300 feet above sea level. The Rockies are in the Central and South American regions. Although the Rocky Mountains are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful.","Some people visit the Rockies. As they are narrating a story, they have a common misconception. They live in the Rocky Mountains (just north of the Alps), and people travel from the north to the southern end of the mountain range to see them. The Rocky Mountains are on the north side of the Alps. The other side of the mountain range is south-west of the Rockies. They a lot more beautiful than the Alps and are difficult to see in the West and to the east of the Alps. Because the Alps are so near, they are farther down to the north. The Rocky Mountains do not have very large cities but are fairly close to the city. They look a lot more beautiful than the Alps. There are many roads in the southern Rockies. There are also several bridges. The road may be longer. There are even more road crossings than the Alps. There are many interesting places to see the Rockies."
B1,"Little Chefs was a bit of a hit for children in London because it included cooking lessons in small groups that gave families a chance to cook together. Now, the class has a waiting list, so parents pay £280 a week for their children to attend. But it is a lot of fun.","One child in their group wanted to learn how to make a great savoury chicken pizza. To their delight, the parents agreed to pay £280 per child. However, the waitlist is so long that there are only 30 children who want to do the course, leaving the school a little behind. They decide to let them choose whether or not they would like to do the course.","The little chefs are a group of three girls and boys. The aim of the course is to teach children how to cook. As the children get older, they get into cooking classes. The classes are given to the children in small groups each week. The children are asked to sit in small classes with their classmates on the weekends and be taught how to make simple food. The school is set up so that the children spend lots of time cooking. As the children grow up, the cookery class will take more practice. However, the food that is cooking will change over time, so it will not change their daily routine. The students will then have a small class to learn how to make some food themselves and then go to a kitchen to make a delicious meal. The class will be held at the school’s gleefully old pub, on the weekends when the weather is cool and people gather to eat. The cooking classes are not restricted to young children, so there is a need to keep an eye out for more classes. The class will be in small groups for 30 children every week, with 10 or more taking part if the cookery lesson is scheduled for each week. The cookery class lasts for 30 minutes with a teacher assisting. The children will learn the skills to make meals on their own and learn to cook their own food. The class will take place on the first floor of a school, and lasts for the duration of the class. The kitchen is usually messy, and the class will be held under the control of a teacher who takes time to teach the children to cook on their own. However, the cookery class is run only once a week. In the classroom the children will learn how to make dinner and how to eat lunch. They then are taught how to take the ingredients from the kitchen and give a cooking demonstration. The cookery class will last about a week. The cookery class is only run for a week, but there is always time to make soup and dinner, so the children are able to eat and watch the cookery demonstration. All of this will ensure the children are well prepared for the day’s lessons. Children will have a chance to have some fun and learn more about the course.",In a local supermarket you can find a class which looks at cooking and how to cook. We have a chef in our house who can help you at your home and then show you how to cook. Occasionally the chef shows you how to make good food using various foods and sauces and a tool called a chef's knife and you can make it yourself. It's an art class so the children don't need to use the kitchen equipment. They can also play with some music and make fun of each other. They also enjoy learning from their own teachers and have some great cooking friends. They are all very happy to be cooking.,"The kids come to the cookery school in a traditional British family way. The main goal of the course is to get kids into cooking, so to make friends with the chefs. The classes are all in small classes. The cookery class lasts about an hour before the class starts and there are 30 of us to choose from. Each week the children practice their cooking at the cookery school, but they come to an agreement. Every week the cookery school is running classes for 30 children to learn how to make good food. All the classes are run individually and there are no private classes. The students can practice at home or have free lessons on the weekends. For the first 30 children the children are taught how to make a meal. They will then learn to cook at home for the first two hours. During the week the cookery school is running classes, but there is some demand from parents for the classes to be run on a weekly basis. The cookery school is an excellent place for the kids. But the main reason their kids want to learn how to make good food is that they can have fun and learn how to make good food.","Little Chefs offers five-week classes in which children must take three weeks to learn what to do in an open kitchen. A group of children in their thirties and early twenties decide a particular course they want to take. Rather than just learning how to bake a cake or make cookies, the children go on to learn basic baking skills and be successful in cooking. They are given lessons that last anywhere between 45 to 80 minutes, although there are a few classes where they have only to spend a few minutes cooking. The kids love the lessons, but they must find a new friend on the farm because their children are not allowed to do it alone. The kids even get to taste the cooking themselves. They are asked to work and their first class takes place on Saturdays. For the price of £280 a class, their children go for what they really want: a chance to learn how to cook delicious food. The course has been popular and highly recommended by their parents. Their families pay about £13 each per class.","Children who want to learn to cook are offered a course. When the school offered this class last Saturdays the children were left with no idea of what the course was about. The children have to wait about three hours for their courses to be taken. The teacher is extremely sympathetic but insists that his pupils continue the class for at least 30 lessons. As soon as the class opens, the children are seated on their own. When they are given the chance to join, the children are shown some recipe books that have helped them achieve the food that they need to cook. They are excited and take the cooking class and look forward to giving it a try."
B1,Mr Kern was a criminal watchdog inspector. He was at a forensics interview about one of the murders. Inspector Cornish knew he was on duty and made him aware of the incident. When asked if he had seen someone on the stairs - or had a look on her face - Mr Kern answered he did not.,Marina had been caught lying on a stairwell where a masked man was beating her. She went to get help from Cornish and Croaddock who were discussing how she was feeling. It was later discovered that the killer was her husband. Mr Cornish blamed them for the murder.,"She had come home early from the police station and ran for a job. There had been another robbery there but the first one was caught. But this one was a mistake. Mrs Bantry found that Marina Gregg's sister told her that she wanted to meet her lover. Marina was very angry when she saw that one of the three men had not been caught. Marina refused. She had offered to get back to the police station, but he refused. 'Mrs Bantry told me she wanted to get back to work,' said Cornish. 'Why did she call the police?' she said. Then the scene began.","Marina had been in possession of a large amount of drugs. She had been nagged, then beaten, in the bushes in their garden. Mrs Bantry slipped on a small amount of blood. She ran into someone and pushed him out of her reach. She was rushed to the Police Department, but Mr Cornish's appeal was denied.","The woman in the wheelchair and the victim - Marina Gregg - had a strange appearance. They both walked up the stairs and heard a woman in her arms in distress, with her hands up on the floor. The two women were at a local bus station and talked to each other. The murder victim was a 63-year-old woman and had been abducted by two men. When two policemen from Los Angeles and London arrived at the local bus stop, the women had a strange face and the victim was very frightened. The man - who had been shot in the head - was found on the floor from a streetside window. He did not appear to be a suspect.","Marina Gregg came forward with a case after her murder. He had just returned to the station and a person was killed. A woman called 999 from the main road, a man named Earl Carver was arrested in the case, the victim was an American. The policeman stopped him to retrace his steps. He saw a man in the back seat of the car and drove away. The man stepped outside and asked for someone to help. When Officers arrived, they found the man they wanted and told them not to bring him. The man was not a good witness. The man was arrested.","Marin Gregg was found dead at an apartment during the investigation. The police commissioner, Cornish, took the blame for the case on the defendants and stepped in - but not before causing them to have a bad first impression. At the police station a member of the media, Ardwyck Fenn, said that he thought Marina Gregg had a 'frozen look' at him. He said he thought he was attracted to her looking so young. A few seconds later, Inspector Cornish called the police at the apartment and asked if she had been home and looking up. The policeman asked if she had heard anything about the murder, she replied 'I didn't believe it'. Cornish and Craddock were discussing the murder at the local police station. Mr Bantry was sitting with her at the table and he wanted to talk to her. As the scene progressed, the woman asked how many frightened people were on the stairs outside, which they did not know as Inspector Craddock asked how many, he said'so many frightened people are on the stairs'. Inspector Craddock stepped in to speak with her and he made a 'frozen look' at the victim. He said he tried to keep the frightened people on the stairs and they were not on the stairs or by the door. He told her that the two women had just entered the building with Mr Bantry and that the police would be taking notice when the officers arrived. The man from the car had blown a hole in the window for the officers to pass so that all of them could have left. Mr Bantry told him the frightened people were on a ladder, which he agreed to do. The policeman asked the woman who was on the ladder what the stabbing took, Mr Bantry replied 'yes'. Inspector Cornish then mentioned that the stabbing had taken place in a hotel in a strip mall. The woman replied 'hence the word'suffocate.' The man shook the carpet and went home to scream. Cornish and Craddock were able to have the body examined at the police station later in the day. The murder began later that night."

Then I realized that the road underneath the tree appeared to be buried in the snow. I was surprised by how well the ice had melted. I guessed it was a snowfall and tried to warn the driver of the danger.","Winter is a colder time of year, so we drive in the cold. When the wind whips we find fog. Fortunately, we have some help from friends and a lot of cars. The more fog we get, the easier it will be to drive safely. Snow is heavy and heavy, so be careful. You can watch the fog but do not risk anything. Snow can be slippery and slippery, so keep your eyes on it. In case you fall or stomp on snow, steer your car to the side to avoid it. After you've gone over a hill, go out and keep on steering.","Snow is incredibly heavy when you drive on it. This may make it hard to drive on a cold day, but driving can save you loads of trouble. Snow also reflects some of the sun's light to your eyes. A hot-weather snowstorm takes away most of the sun's light before it melts. A heavy layer of snow can cause damage to your car as well as your engine, causing more heat and more engine power to be drained. The air between the wheels will cause it to melt, thus damaging your engine. This can cause your car to stop in some time. If you're afraid of melting snow, look outside for some shade and a cup of hot water.","Winter is the most dangerous time of the year. A snowstorm can cause your windows to close, your tires, and your tires to puncture. So, you've got to drive carefully to avoid the dangers. So, it's important to be careful on the roads because you're going to need to have some sort of emergency equipment. It's also important to be aware that it's hard to see a light after you've driven through your window. This means that you may have to stop driving if you encounter any ice or puddles.","Winter driving is hard but getting the right amount of sleep can be a good thing. However, the roads are icy in places and when you go in winter you are not warned. This is because it is so easily made unsafe that it takes you an hour to get back on the road. The main factor of avoiding the road and stopping is the lack of time available to drive safely. The snow causes all sorts of problems. Snow can form under the melting snow, so when you take a slow left turn on a fast downhill slope, it may cause you problems. The road is slippery and slippery too.",Winter driving is a dangerous activity. There is a lot of snow on the road and icy weather sometimes causes slippery roads. It's so easy to forget it and go to the store and store the items you need. The following information is needed to protect yourself during winter driving.

B1,"Tom Wilcott started Moonshine back in 1991. He was also an active bass guitarist with The Waves and was a founding member of the band. Moonshine, a band formed in 1995, first released their first album together in 1995. On this album, Tom Wilcott starts on the bass guitar and Simpson on drums. This was a nice change from the last album that was recorded just last year but it's a great addition for the group, it's the first time they've had two members in one place! Moonshine toured Europe in 2001 and 2012 with the band before the split in 2008, but there were many changes which are hard to come by at this stage. This is the third album the band have released since they went from being an indie band with minimal sound and their core band in the mid-1990s. Tom has had a recurring solo career, as well as a reunion with his own guitarist David, after which he took over as lead guitarist on the rock band The Waves. He signed to the band at the start of last year. Simon McVee has been replaced with his current bassist Tom Simpson who replaced him after one season. He was replaced on drums by Jim Wilson who replaced Simon McVee on guitar but the first session for the album took place on 8 August. Taking the lead for the band, Tom decided he was going to join the rest of the band, despite Simon's departure. In the past, it has been a struggle to establish a solid and rhythmic band. Tom Simpson, as the drummer, has played with the band on lead guitar since their last album and has said he’s willing to go the distance. In 2015, Tom Simpson left Moonshine as the band's chairman and, while Tom’s still a drummer, is a big part of the band and has had a major impact on them as well. He is not going to be the one to continue to play for the rest of the band though.","Moonshine was a band from Leeds who released their third CD. Now they have another group, a new member, Tim McGraw who had been with the group for many years. Tim McGraw has joined to play guitar, and he is taking up the drums on a new project. It was a difficult decision for the band because they made a few changes, and were still quite fresh as of now. Before the tour to Japan, Jim Harnick had been a member of the band. He spent most of his time and energy with the band, and will be joined by his new drummer, Tom Simpson. The band also released a new video, this time of Tim McGraw. Tom Simpson plays a guitar in the same way as Michael James and Tim McGraw, and plays a harmonica in the same way that Mike Ross plays Tony.","After hearing the band’s debut single “Here Again” their drummer went to New Zealand. This is the debut for Tom Wilcott. The album was released at an amazing cost. The band had a fantastic year, and they were doing well. Tom has a unique voice and a good guitar playing too. The group's fourth CD, ‘Here Again’ shows a lot of potential. This album marks the first time they have been on a solo record.","They have just released their third disc, ‘Here Again’. Their first is called ‘Here Again’. The band was founded by singer Robson from The Walkmen, and they recorded on a mighty big kool-aid bass player for their third studio album, ‘Ocean of Changes.’ Their third was released on a rambunctious new version of the same name and featured new songs and many new songs. In the early stages of ‘Here Again’, the band's first song, ‘Hilton and the Wind,’ was a pretty sad, heart-breaking moment to the band, describing it as 'just a bad day, a bunch of people just made a bad decision.' The band's first album, 'Infidel', was a very good alternative rock. They also toured Canada.","Moonshine is a blues rock band from London. The band has had a huge success in the past. They played the London club scene in the early 1990s. In the 1980s, they began a musical revival in London. Since then, they have released three albums – the latest – ‘Here again’ and a new titma. The band has also performed in London in recent years and has a lot of fans. The best thing about Moonshine is that the band has been around for a long time.","I love the title of Moonshine’s second CD, because one of them was a follow-up to 'The Waves'. For many years, Moonshine has always been a huge fan of alternative rock, a popular form of music, but today is much different. After releasing a third disc, Moonshine’s third album, ‘Here Again’ is a follow-up to 'The Waves'. There have been a few changes since the last CD with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year. Tom Simpson on drums is still the most popular member of the band. The CD was released at Moonshine’s North American head office for the second week in a row. Now, with the new band and the release of this second CD, Moonshine have been able to continue their playback and a little bit more of their original style. Tom has taken a lot of responsibility for his new career. However, he has never done this on a solo tour. Rather, he is trying to be the best man on stage.","This week the band Moonshine released their third CD and have released the debut album together with the debut album – Here Again – a reformed version of ‘The Waves’ which they have released in 2006. The first song is written and sung by Tom Wilcott and Mike Watts, although it has not yet been released on the album since it has been released on March 9. Throughout the songwriting process, the members of Moonshine have progressively been brought into the lead, and the album has been highly praised. Earlier this week a line up was announced. The first CD featured two members of the band: Jason Lee, who was replaced with Mick Jagger in January and which was later replaced by drummer Tim Dodd. He joined the band two weeks later, and his last album was released on March 8 in February. The third and final CD was released on the same day, and with the same lineup, with Tom Wilcott playing bass and Mick Jagger playing drums. This is the third and final album released since then."

B1,"The Norman invaded England in 1066 with a larger force than any other city. Norwich was the first of many towns to fall out of favour and be fortified. So, it became the capital of the British East Anglia. Many people still live in Norwich and are still waiting for more than two hundred years to live there. Some of the original residents were still living in the area at that time and some were still living in Norwich itself. Norwich was also the home of the Normans and in some ways, still one of the most famous cities in England. At one time Norwich was part of the British East Anglian Empire. There had been a place to live but not until the onset of the Norman Invasion. The Normans had been fighting in the Middle Ages but could not conquer the land they had taken over. Today there are more and more settlements in the area. Its time and space is important to preserving a place to live in Norwich.","A few years ago Norwich was a small village beside a River Wensum. The Normans invaded from Norman rule, they made Norwich become part of East Anglia. One of the Normans captured the village. They also destroyed Norwich Cathedral. Norwich became part of East Anglia.","Many people thought that Norwich was a small place until they found out about the Norman invasion in 1066. The Norman invasion left Norwich one of England's most populous places. Then they found out that the small place of Norwich could have many benefits for residents. When the Normans took over the city, Norwich became a place to live. It was in 1066 that the city gained recognition among the towns and cities of England.","Norfolk began as a small village beside the River Wensum, then extended all the way up to the city centre. As time went on, this area became much larger. Soon afterwards, it became one of the most populous towns in England, and within an hour the capital was becoming an important center. Then, after the Norman invasion in 1066, Norwich was the center of the local economy. It was soon transformed into a city which had become famous after the town was burned down in the 16th century. Now, at least 2,000 people live in Norfolk. This is a prestigious building located about seven miles from Norwich.","This sentence is from an article in the Daily Mirror: At the time of the Norman invasion of 1066 Norwich was one of the largest towns in England. The main village resembles a cottage with an imposing red castle. It was made for a living as Norwich became its capital. It has been referred to as ""Aldgate"". The word ""Aldgate"" means the early town. One important factor that makes Norwich a popular place is the water supply, as is its town hall. The water supply of Norwich includes much of the capital's local rivers. The town hall has also included many smaller towns, such as the town hall, where people are usually entertained and rousted for entertainment. Although it is a small place, it remains famous for being a cultural center.","When Edward the Great, King of England, invaded England from England in 1066, he sat next to his wife at one of his castles. During this attack, he was killed. Edward, his wife, and his two brothers fought each other, and in this battle the Normans killed and captured many.","There are many places to live in East Anglia. These include the town of Norwich. The Norman invasion of England was at the time a short-lived war. The Normans wanted to conquer Norwich. After the invasion and the Normans tried to gain access to Norwich, there was an opportunity for people to live in Norwich. We'll examine each place on the scale below."
B1,Sharks are the biggest animal in the oceans and they like to eat anything on their bare feet. Little turtles and fish will eat these little creatures and feed on them.

The students have been invited to a fair every year to get their school certificates. I can't wait for the next one."
B1,"Matt and I were standing in the river on a Saturday afternoon in November. We walked around and sat by a small river. We were all very impressed with the beauty of the waters around us. Matt, who had been a rock climber since childhood, had never been in a rock climb. We were told that the rocks were still very soft when they were rock climbed. We had been to various attractions and had never heard of it before. Fortunately our friend Matt, who was an experienced rock climber, was able to join us on our trip. We didn't really realize that we were about to climb the same height. Matt took us from behind us a few metres from the river, looking down at the river behind. Matt was impressed with how much he enjoyed rock climbing and how different from our previous climbers. The next day, we were told that we would have to climb more rock because the height was such a huge gain. After finding out that we had to climb up an impressive 7,000 metres before we could do the climb ourselves, we were so thrilled!",I had never wanted to go rock climbing before but was excited to try it. I climbed it over and over. It's now a 'fountain of memories' for me. I was amazed how fast it went! It was all at once.,"The previous evening was one of the most fun days of my life. I was about to try the rock climb. We decided to try a free climbing class for the area. I didn't know what I was doing or how it could really help. At first I was impressed with how it turned out. My friend came in and explained to me that climbing was basically the exercise of using your legs to climb. Upon climbing, you must do multiple rock climbs. You must do multiple rock climbs before you reach the top of the rope ladder. After you have rock-climbed your way around the rope ladder, your body gradually loses balance and stops climbing. When you go into your trunk you may feel some trepidation or a little bit of stress. It made it difficult to get into the rope and I didn't know what I was doing. Eventually I realized why I had been so excited about climbing at all.","I decided to climb a rock on the edge of the river. The day before, my friends, and I were going to head over to get some sun on the river side. My friend Matt and I got up to the top of the rock so we could have a walk. It seemed like a great idea at first, but I'd forgotten I was there. I then remembered that people can climb any rocks. I tried to follow it but I didn't really take the plunge. I ended up hanging up and not climbing any more! Then I noticed my friend Matt and I were sitting outside watching a great riverside show. I wanted to climb a rock until I fell. I am now up there on the side of the river! Then I thought about it for a week. It was good fun and I started to think about how it turned out!","Matt said that rocks are a good exercise. It's an exciting way to climb a large rock. But my friend said that there are dangers to going on rock climbs. The rocks are high, so that means they can have a lot of airflow in there. We both thought that we'd get some fun!",I was climbing a rock from the side of the river. I saw a large waterfall behind me. I asked to climb down and heard a knock. I finally made it. It was very steep and dangerous.,"Matt decided to climb up a steep rock wall a bit. The weather was beautiful and we were able to make it up there in the rain. But we were still quite unimpressed by how rock-climbing turned out. The rock walls were dripping with snow, and the rock walls were inaccessible to us. I saw Matt climbing from behind the other climbers and couldn't get my attention when he came up. The next day, they said they were going for a big rock-climb, but it was only after they took off that I saw them climbing! The weather forecasters suggested maybe it was raining, but Matt didn't know what temperature was going to get us there. As we headed back to the Activity Centre, we realized that the weather was dripping. Matt's group didn't want to climb until later, so they stopped at the Activity Centre to get some rest. But once at the Activity Centre, they found we'd been having a tough time getting our foot to stop from doing it! The weather was great, there was a hot sun, and we'd gone hiking in the gorge. It was very quiet and there were people around us all day. Then I looked back at Matt and noticed there were no rocks, dirt, or rocks in the area. He spotted some rocks and said it was very cool. Then he noticed there were people rock-climbing on the walls. Afterwards we didn't want to go anywhere else. The activities centre was quite empty and we started to climb the wall. We went for a walk in the river. It's quite a walk to get to the top but we did get some good shade. We started with a large boulder, which it wasn't hard to climb, and then went downhill on the slide to make it to the bottom. It was a good walk, but I wasn't sure how tall it was. Luckily the water was very clear and it didn't have to be very hot. Then Matt gave it a second look around and noticed there was a lot of people standing above us. I thought about how great it was. And as I was climbing, I felt like they were doing more than we could bear to do."
B1,I just put the money away in the wallet. Then I was too scared to open the bank account!,"John wanted to leave a letter to the Newport Evening News. John's friend told him it was too late. John is 72 years old and has only been to his new town about 8 months. He told the News that the letter was sent to him when he was visiting him at work. As he'd been a long distance walker, John and a few friends stopped and looked for him, looking for him. When they got to the mailbox they were met by John and another man. John and the other man were astonished to see John's letter as well as their friend's letter. He was afraid that he'd get caught in a scam and that he would eventually have to fly to London. He'd told John that this wasn't the truth and that he should give it to someone. John couldn't believe John's friend that they hadn't told the letter. He was angry at John for having left his handbag on the bus to be on the way to a party. John thought that John had lied to him. He had thrown the mail in and then walked to the bus. He realized that he had been a waste of time and was a good friend of John's. John had an uncle who knew something about money. John's uncle is also a businessman. John wanted to send a letter to the newspaper that was going to the Newport Evening News. John did so and John accepted the news. John also lost his wallet and had to write to the editor. The letter is written to the Editor to get them out and to express his concern. John's letter goes to the editor and is delivered.","I had left my handbag in the bus - a big mistake. I took off the bus because the driver missed me. I got caught up in traffic, and my purse and cash had been stolen. I'm 72 years old, so I am not very strong in judgment. I had left my purse on the bus but there was no way I would get to it. I didn't know what to do when I left it - I had left the purse on the bus and I was a long way from home.","I decided to leave my wallet on the bus on my way home from my holidays. I did not want to worry about the money that was in it. I threw it away and didn't do anything. Then the bus was about to catch off. As I headed home and put it on a tarp, my wallet was tossed out. My wallet was still in my handbag. I was worried as it may have slipped. I finally decided to stop on my way home and was relieved to discover that my wallet had landed safely on my doorstep.",It was the day before a bus hit the beach at Newport. I thought I'd put it off too. I didn't want to waste time or money and I decided to snatch it and head straight home. Now I knew where it was. I kept hurling my handbag and it had gone everywhere. After a few seconds I felt a sudden smell of water. I tried to stay alive until I realised it was over.,By a long way I was in Cardiff. It was the end of Saturday afternoon. So I left my handbag on the bus to go home. I sat in my handbag on my bike at home. It was the last time we were on the bus. I am 72 years old.,"I slipped the money into my purse, and then decided it was too late to go back. So I had to wait in a hurry to find it. On the bus was a good time to get it!"
B1,By Alex Greene. A report by Dave Worthington Homestyle a new furniture shop was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers including a leather sofa on sale for £45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am).

The store closed at midnight last Thursday for a full day in July. A report from David Worthington says that the store closed at midnight and had a great Christmas stocking. A big crowd sat outside the store before they made their journey through the doors. They were told that they were offered rooms in exchange for the furniture and an early check in with their room service to give them food. By noon the shop had about 11,000 people.","After opening, a new furniture shop was forced to close after a long line. As many as 6000 people hurried to the shop in an hour. The two families were seated in the lounge while people waited for the furniture. They were not there, so there were only a few empty tables and chairs. The customers waited for hours before they were helped. A shopper had a hand on a sofa, and a sofa that cost from £35 to £40. An odd experience: a car moving on the tracks behind a train. After a short visit, a salesman spotted a sofa at the new shop. At the age of 18 and a teenager, there were about 690 people waiting for a place to get some furniture.","A newly built shop was forced to close during opening hours due to an order cancellation, so customers had a hard time picking out a sofa and bed. Customers came across lots of deals, including some leather sofas on sale. But while a few more people hurried to the store, the shop also offered a good variety of special offers including leather sofas, bed beds and bed sets. A report from Dave Worthington by A.B. Worthington was aimed at a high school student. He wrote that he was impressed by a newly-opened shop.","Shops usually have a price tag of £40 to £50 at peak times, but Homestyle has a special sale on a sofa, two beds and a mattress for £40. So, as a customer, I had a difficult decision to make when I went shopping. I arrived at Homestyle and was not disappointed. The salesman told me a price tag for the sofa is £35 and the bed was £35 and they were only sold for 20 people. One day before the sale, he said he could buy a mattress for about £280 and it's about £50. At that time the store had been closed to all public access. He was upset to find out how many people were there with a table and a bed and when he was done, the people at Homestyle complained to his assistant. There were some odd facts about the salesman. After the sale, he was informed about the special discount from his assistant. He said he'd try to get everyone to buy a mattress. He offered to help with a quick quote, but after one or two customers had tried to find the right item, the store was closed. He said he could not make a final decision based on sales and competition, and the furniture shop had a very choppy customer-base. He said he would try to do his best to avoid any problems before the sale. In the final decision, Homestyle reported the sale price of a leather sofa at £45 - £120 (£80).","A new furniture shop was closed at midnight last Thursday. Dave Worthington told HomeStyle they were trying to get it a second lease but it is a great offer. Up to 6,000 people hurried in the store to spend an hour on the furniture. A new room for a family had to be cleaned before the Christmas sale and even a big family to come and see how to use it. An extra £20 on a bed, with two nights, was half price for the shop, but a hefty one for a family. As a new shop opens, people are looking for a new way to spend the day and do a lot of shopping for their family. At Homestyle, there were lots of special offers. Firstly, they had a sofa that would go on sale in 20 minutes and then you can get one for only £30-$40. This is a little pricey, but it's just a good deal. Another offer on the floor was a bed at £5-£14 per night. This week Dave Worthington said he was trying to find something that he could rent in the city centre or in an outbuilding and was looking for something that would make a special night. So, he drew his camera and decided to come and buy it for $80. He decided to drive up to the home to look around for an opportunity to sell his furniture.","The store was shut after the opening of Homestyle at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the shop for furniture. As they walked in, the store reopened. Up to 6000 people hurried to the shop for furniture. The store reopened shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. At the time it opened, customers were waiting to see if anyone had been able to make their purchases. As most people in the shop had hurried to take the opportunity to make purchases, most people in the shop screamed and screamed oh and ah for a minute. Then, they looked out over the park and saw people rushing to take the opportunity."
B1,"Physicist Alan Hennell was asked to help a group of tourists, a nature guide. After doing some research, Alan found the project’s soil had been altered to be safe for botanists to use. Initially it lacked the chemicals needed to protect the soil and thrive in the climate. At first sight, it appeared like a scene from a science fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is.","The Eden Project opened in 2008, and since then has become a tourist attraction – a museum of world geography and ecology. It is located at the Eden Project in the south-west of England, near Birmingham. Visitors visit the new Biospheres, which are designed to protect earthly ecosystems from climate change. Visitors notice that the biospheres provide unique, biologically diverse landscapes, all designed by locals and scientists. They include many of the planet’s largest biospheres and biomes, making it an ideal location for exploring wildlife and promoting sustainable development of the environment. The biospheres also include the Earth’s largest biodiversity, the Atlantic Ocean. The biodiversity is home to rare earth minerals, like cyanobacteria. In a small biosphere, visitors can see fossilized fish, crustaceans, and marine organisms that have been reintroduced into the atmosphere. For a fuller sense of wildlife and ecology, the Biospheres offer visitors an insight into the relationship between humans and the Earth. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. As visitors explore the Biospheres, their experiences are more likely to be shared, and the biodiversity helps to understand how the world works.","The Eden Project is a former industrial site in the south-west of England. The new park, which started as an outdoor learning centre a year ago, now houses nearly 6,000 plants and animals. Visitors will find them all in one place.

But since the opening of the project in the south-west of England, the attraction has become an international tourist attraction. Whenever people visit a part of the site, their attention switches places. Visitors are given a tour of a building on which the biosphere is located. The biosphere contains an area of more than 12,000 km2 of protected woodland - something much bigger than the London Botanic Gardens which are still in use. Visitors also learn about the plants growing on the biosphere at this site. Some of the biospheres on the project are small and vulnerable, but other have a similar effect as the environment. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone that illustrates the importance of the relationship between people and plants. The Eden Project is built under two levels of protection at the northern end of the British National Forest. Visitors will have to go through a variety of areas, which include the ‘green belt’, the ‘cold belt’ and ‘grass belt’.

B1,"My daughter decided to start a new job at the university. I didn't think I'd be able to afford a degree. But after checking the websites of all the colleges in the area, I finally gave it a try! I was really excited! The classes were so open and ranging from learning about the world to the history of the world. I was so excited to be able to give it a try. It isn't a job you can be in the same office as someone else. It is a great way for me to see my knowledge and learn some interesting things.",They were invited to a graduation party for their class at the university. This party was very well received. The open university was very exciting and took place in April. The guests were given lunch before the ceremony and began working together to learn a new skill. The students had to practice their new knowledge and had to find solutions to solve the problems of the world.,The Open University offered many different degrees for their students. Some of them are advanced degrees. Others are more advanced degrees. The most popular of these are: The Open University can give you a degree or certificate in a number of areas. The Open University is more popular than most other universities. The Open University in Manchester is the largest university in the world.,"Open University offers a very flexible curriculum. Classes are delivered in a professional setting. Most students have classes in many subjects. The Open University is open to all interested people. The courses are all subject based, meaning students learn from each other. When students have questions about their chosen subject, the faculty recommends one course. Students are also given free time to get to know each other. Students are also given a chance to play chess, basketball, band, ballet, and handball. The Open University doesn't have a closed school building but has a student clubs and cafeteria. If you decide to graduate from the Open University, you're advised to stop and think about other options if you want to continue learning, but may have to stop and think about the courses that could make you better, such as marketing.","The Open University is one of the colleges and universities around the world. They offer a wide array of programs and courses including Advanced Placement, Advanced Placement, Engineering, Architecture, Engineering, Applied Science, Social Sciences, Music, Arts, Social History, and more. In order to become a student you must be on a schedule of at least one month's study. This is because if you want to be chosen, you are required to work at least 6 months at a university. All courses require a minimum of two semester hours. You must be eligible for the admissions process to be offered a degree or a certificate. The open university accepts applications from young people who want to enter the college or university. Most open universities accept applications from people over 15 years of age. The program requires only one semester, which includes coursework. When your first year of classes ends you must apply for another degree as well. After you submit your application, you will receive a diploma. You must be a student of the Open University to take this program. This may not seem like a big deal to some, but it gives you the chance to be accepted for a degree.","My friend contacted the Open University. They asked me to take it in. I said it's an institution and you don't have to stop working. They give you a degree. But it's not necessarily a degree, it's a college degree. Besides, you can do more activities than you would have if you had never studied before. They give you a lot of free time. You can get out of your job when you want. But if you've never studied before, you can still do all those kinds of activities. Then if you want to work while you study, it's a good time for you to stop working.","A college student found that the Open University offered an extra free place to study after college. He started out by attending a local university. He chose the university because he loved studying. Then he made an offer to complete a degree in education. He was offered a free place to study a few days after being accepted at the university. As a result the student discovered that the university's special benefits included the opportunity to work part-time. He began taking more advanced classes, and became a more skilled person. After studying at the university, his teacher recommended that he study part-time. This suited him well since the courses he could take may be more hands-on than what he could find elsewhere."
B1,"Katie Atkins played the trumpet for my school jazz band. My band was invited by a large group of students from local high schools to perform in the jazz competition. I played the trumpet for about fifteen minutes and a half of the time. I did the following things in a quiet classroom environment: I had a trumpet and a trombone. I played for about 25 minutes and made a snare, and then played bass. My trumpet and trombone were playing well together – with the exception of my voice! The trumpet was thrown from the back of the class. My band won, but the school couldn’t afford to be without my trumpet. The jazz band, called Blues, was proud of their victory and the school accepted them.","Jazz at my school had long since been forgotten. My friends and I had been playing in band all week. Then, as band practiced, one of my friends was injured on the dance floor. We had to take a break. But then it started to rain, and we all started to cheer. We played a lot of jazz last year, and we won the competition!","My band had been playing a few songs as we were leaving school. I was the one who had the most competition. We wanted to get as many people to join us. After a practice session with all the other bands, I realised that my band could have been better. Then I came out with a song in front of me for everyone to watch. Everyone loved it! It was like being there for the first time.","My band had to win the jazz competition. This made my school band seem more like a band than a group. Afterwards, the school bands decided not to compete. They drew on a team from each school to perform. It was very challenging! Each band gave away their T-shirts and were encouraged to be in groups as the competition progressed. I really loved the band!","I like jazz, and I think I am a good student at it! I played a guitar and played in a band at my school, and I'm quite excited. I like the costumes I like. They are sexy and brightly-coloured. I played the trumpet in my school jazz band in the morning after school, and I had a very excited time being a part of the band. My band was one of four bands from nearby high schools, all playing jazz together.","Katie's school band is playing music. She takes lessons in the instruments. When the group comes together for a competition, they play each other. Katie's band wins!",The band were all in tune when they won the competition. I had to sing with them because of the noise. We had to be slow so we could learn. They had to keep to their tune. They had their own costumes ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly coloured T-shirts. The band was a little bit shy so they got dressed in uniforms with the same noise. The band performed in front of the crowd. The group held up their instruments and played together. They even played a show at a school music event.
B1,"When I started looking for a flight from England to Australia I was not sure where to start. To help me get an idea of the trip I wanted to ask a couple of friends. And the search began! They were looking for a cheap flight. They looked everywhere online and got to select their flight. They searched across the UK, New Zealand, and Australia and had a complete surprise. They chose to check out Australia because a lot of us are staying in Australia. I was in Perth for one night on Sunday and there was not one booking. But I was excited. They offered a discount in our booking. All the bookings were booked and then sent to their homes. The flight was a little more expensive than I was expecting. And I knew that it was going to be a hard flight but I didn't mind. My trip was also about making a deal for the best price in Australia. The fact that this was under just $1985 was a huge deal! Thankfully we got to Australia by train so we were the cheapest airline to fly to. After arriving in Perth, Air Australia flights between Perth/Alice Springs/Cairns/Sydney. Coach from Sydney to Melbourne via Canberra and Albury. All airport transfers in Australia. Nineteen nights' accommodation in grade hotels with full continental breakfast. I was extremely pleased and I would definitely go back!","By this time the price for an Australian flight to Australia is only £1985! The price will change every week when it comes to travelling. It is a special deal and the flight leaves from London to Perth to return from Melbourne. Our price includes scheduled flights from London or Manchester to Perth returning from Melbourne. Once you arrive at Perth you are asked to wait a few days. You have to take your travel money with you, so take your bags with you. Your trip costs is included in the price, and you can stay in a grade hotel with full continental breakfast.","Our price included a flight from London to Australia with accommodation in Grade 1 grade hotels. This included a round trip hotel from Sydney to Melbourne. They also paid a trip to Adelaide to see Australia. We were able to do some sightseeing and book a coach train from Sydney to Melbourne. We then arrived in Perth and arrived in Australia at 3:00 to catch the train. Upon arrival in Australia, we were greeted by our hotel manager. He had a great experience. He suggested we had an exclusive stay in a grade hotel and we made up our mind about staying in the grade 1. We were not disappointed. When we arrived in Australia, we received a phone call that we were not in Australia. We had to wait for an hour for our flight, the car came and we decided not to check in. We walked around Melbourne, walked around the city, tried a couple of pubs and had a bottle of wine and a chat with our roommates, and finally got our accommodation in a grade hotel for just £1985. The price is really high for Australia, and as you have found out we would never be on the same level as other Western countries.","As we were packing up to go back to Melbourne, it was time to go on a shopping trip for the day. We realised we could not afford to drive to Perth for a long time and the prices were not good. We stopped in Perth's airport to pick up flights, we were able to stay on one of the classy rooms without much stress. When we arrived in Perth, there were no other passengers in the flight. All the planes were in high condition and the train was flying to Perth. Afterwards, we got in to Australia. To top it off, the airport was surrounded by dense rainforest. Sadly, we were warned that these forests were dangerous to wildlife. After spending a night in Perth, we noticed a large number of wolf mummies. We argued with the locals about what to do next. But the wolves were not afraid of the fox, and some of them were terrified. We decided to head back to Perth for some rest and we tried. Luckily we had plenty of time to rest and take in the sights. Eventually we realized we had a lot to learn. We tripped over at some point and found a place with a large number of caves. We were able to walk from one of the caves and climb into a cobblestone cave that we had climbed. We spent the night in a cobblestone cave for hours and only had to carry on. Once in Perth we decided to stay at a hotel to enjoy some of the local things we had seen. Luckily our hotel staff was available and was ready to give us advice. We were amazed how quickly they could come across some of the wolves that were hiding out there. It was just as they had been in Sydney and Brisbane. It was definitely worth the money. However, the wolves were unable to find much help as the heat and falling temperature had caused them to attack the wolves and other insects. This is why the wolves had to be protected from the humans. When wolves were hung over after the humans moved on to other areas, they were able to survive. That is why it was so important we let them live peacefully.","Buying a one bedroom accommodation in Australia's capital for only £1985 a day is a real bargain. Fortunately, we made bookings early so we were able to accommodate them. We paid for all essentials. Then came the flight! The Australian National Airways were booking to Melbourne. We decided to book on the same day. So we arrived at Perth airport on a regular basis. The flight was the same, and the car was running on a fixed schedule. Luckily for our group of 16 passengers, we took advantage of this bargain. The total price includes flights from Melbourne to Sydney and from Sydney to Perth. The price comes with the accommodation and airport transfer.",My father bought a car and drove away to visit his family. He had a very long journey and was very dissatisfied with the company he got. He decided to ask about another car which did not fit his schedule. The company that charged him for the car left in the car that day because the driver didn't think the car was necessary. He then had the car park on his side and it was a good idea to go ahead and drive away. The car park and car park were a nice sight on either side.,"The story of Michael in his hotel bed and breakfast is telling you how to spend your holiday in Australia. The cost of the trip is relatively inexpensive. In Australia, the average is £600. The accommodation is in a Grade Four hotel in the Australian city of Perth. Michael would rather spend his first day in Australia but find the value for his money by booking airport transfers. However, the rate for one night is still cheaper than the normal rate. Michael was looking to book a flight to Australia and a return flight to Melbourne, but only was able to get a refund of about 1100 francs. He needed to be able to save up to 5000 francs for the transfer. The journey in Australia took four days from the start of the trip, until the last flight of the journey had arrived in Melbourne. Michael chose a deluxe coach from the airlines, which had two single, double, and double seats. Mike spent the rest of the day at the airport, scuba diving and working at a local waterpark. Getting a refund of about 5000 francs was a nightmare. His wife was not sure if they would have a refund on the rental or the cost of the transfer. Eventually they had a problem staying in an Australian-style hotel, and he spent the next three days in an English-class hotel. With the help of the hotel management, Michael could get back to Australia in less than a day, although this is not a bad deal. Michael decided not to cancel the flight and went home to Australia.

B1,"Gaspar de Portola was a Spanish explorer. He first saw it in 1769 on land and it is an old coast port. Then he discovered San Francisco Bay on the coast, which is a natural harbour. It is very small and low-lying and is in the San Francisco Bay District. His search led him to this part of California. When he finally found it in 1769, the area was very clean.","Gaspar de Portola was a explorer who was interested in exploring the Bay of San Francisco and the Bay of Biscay. He spent most of his time exploring San Francisco Bay, so it was no surprise that the Bay of Biscay was the first place explorers found. There were also a number of islands off the coast of San Francisco Bay. During this time, however, there were also other discoveries on the bay. For example, one day Gaspar de Portola's son, Thomas, had a dream of swimming down San Francisco Bay. After he finally made his way across San Francisco Bay, he spotted a little piece of land along the coast. He asked to see the area but wasn't able to get there. So he stayed on land and found the area.",San Francisco Bay is a natural harbour on the coast of northern California.

It was a huge natural harbour, but was discovered by land rather than by sea. Jean and Jean admired San Francisco Bay as a natural harbour.","San Francisco Bay escaped its severe ice age. Its beaches and mountains had many frogs and other critters. So the San Francisco Bay was named after a Spanish explorer. The tides were the only things in the sand and it got a lot warmer in the warm spring. This led to the California coast being contaminated with acid rain. The coast is not very safe for fish. It does not have enough people to find a suitable food source for their fishermen. As a result, the food would disappear and some people were killed. Some people took the fish to the shacks to eat and the food would go in the trash. While San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it is not a harbour at all.","The Englishmen went to San Francisco to visit the castle. They found that this was a natural harbour of Spanish settlement, not by land. When they entered the castle, they found a cave that had been uninhabited since the 7th century. The cave was well preserved and looked pretty much like a castle. The cave had a lovely natural garden and had many kinds of plants and animals. The castle was an attractive place to see many local people.","The San Francisco Bay is a small harbor in San Francisco, California. A large number of ships come to visit the coast. They stop at the San Francisco Bay Bridge for the last time. Many ships head to San Francisco Bay to leave and stop for a drink. The bridge is a giant stone for the harbour. The harbour is not open on summer days and there is always a storm. The harbor is one of a few natural areas to see and you can explore it by walking through it. The Bay is a pleasant place for people to rest after a day out. It is also one of the most beautiful places in the Bay area and there are endless waterways to explore."

Now I ask: What does living ethically mean? I'm Justin Rowlatt, director of communications and ethics at BBC One. So, what does living ethically mean?...As a young adult, Justin has worked for over 20 years to become the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. Justin has been in the roles of news anchor, blogger and blogger since she was nine. She has worked for a magazine and was BBC News Editor in Chief since 1990. She is now a freelance journalist. She's been called a 'Ethical Man' on the BBC's 'Ethical Man' page. Justin's personal stories are full of facts and lies, and is written in a lighthearted way.","I'm Justin Rowlatt and I am the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. I started going on a quest to become the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. I have a friend Justin who lives in London, but Justin is not sure if he wants to become a man or a scientist. Justin was told by Justin that he is a student. The University of Oxford has an ethical school, and this is a question everyone is asking. There's a question about the ethicalness of society today, and Justin's answers are very specific about it. Justin isn't sure what he wants to do and the answer to it is that there's no point. Justin thinks he's a genius who can rethink things. Hopefully when you get back to this topic - and I think you too - you'll find out. You'll know about it later.","The BBC has a very strict and ethical code of conduct regarding ethical practice. I'm Justin Rowlatt. I believe I'm an ethical man. I'm proud of what I do because I'm also the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. I've learned the value of the code, though some people call it the 'Ethical Code'. I'm not a 'Ethical man', I'm simply an ordinary man who is passionate about my craft. I'm not a big fan of the code of conduct, and I don't think people will care what's really right for them. I don't want to see people start to give in to it. I'm a believer in the rule of honesty.","Justin was excited to be the BBC's 'Ethical Man' but had a lot of problems with the job. He became quite good with his car and couldn't stop his cars from going downhill when they did. That's where he found the acrobatics part of his personality which actually saved him some money. Justin's life became a lot easier that the job, as he thought he knew exactly what he was doing. A lot of petty crimes, including a murder, were stopped because of Justin's efforts. He worked in a restaurant and had to come up with something he could have done without. He tried his best to prove that even simple everyday things such as drinking red wine and writing a good story will never save a life. However, the situation still made him miserable and he lost interest in making it, so Justin decided he would go into the job and find out what all the consequences could be. Finally he decided he wasn't the right candidate because it was only one chance for himself and his friends. The BBC wanted Justin to become 'Ethical Man' and make sure the job was right. Justin was very happy about his choice of the job, and he wanted to do it well, so he got a job working on cars and wine bottles to make them easier to deal with.

The interviewer asked him to describe the ethical rules he'd tried to follow. He gives a general explanation of what he does - something that he doesn't do often enough. The interviewer says the BBC's ethics rules are just a 'python' to judge, so he's a writer.

B1,We came upon a camp in the park. We wanted to help the boys. We made a circle of lights for each son. The men in the camp were the happiest. The camp has grown to over half a hundred women.,"Our team, including our mother and the gang leader, decided to have a camp for their young girls. They used a circle of lights each for one of the boys in our camp. The camp had been around for about eight weeks, and by the time it was dark, we were all over forty. Our camp had grown to the size of a football field.","I went to a camp for the day and was shocked that fifty men were being executed. My friends and I went to look at the lights but not the girls.

We gathered as many girls as possible and talked to them. So we started dancing.,"Two girls went outside to look at the police. It was dark outside. There were not many people in the park, so the parents were very hesitant to go. They went to the police station. They were going out to find the women.

They waited for a frantic hour to get their clothes fixed.","During the last day of our camp, we had fifty-two boys in prison. We made a circle of lights one for each son and each other.

Richard was a traveller, and he was chosen as the World's First Landman. She later became a famous archaeologist. In 1927 the Hotel sold its building. When the hotel was bought and expanded, fewer people visited as they moved away from the area. The family moved away to Sunningdale because of her family's interest in history.

To make things easier for guests to enjoy the evening, many residents opted to stay at the hotel's private bungalow. The only problem that one has with a turret in a turret is that it is not very easy to find suitable beds. It is not difficult to find mattresses on the beds that are not big enough for a small child. The building is very small and very noisy, though the rooms themselves are large enough to accommodate a baby.

B1,"Two years agoBen asked us to buy a set of drums for his birthday. Then two years ago we decided to take it to the local rock band. We played a band in the 'big time' at the university. We gathered all of the group at the college. When Ben was 11, we brought a set of drums. Ben began to play the drums. We were excited because we liked the noise of the music. When Ben was 16, we decided to take it to the rock band.","Ben's older brother, a sixteen-year-old whose father played drums, told us he wanted to get a set for his birthday.","Ben wanted to own a drum set when he was seven years old. He tried to be hard - but was not sure he would stick with it. He was reluctant because he felt no one else could play the drums he wanted. It became his favorite game. He then decided to watch TV, sing and play the drums. He decided to learn to play the drums and the experience changed his life. In the end we gave him the drums.","He wants to hear some rock music. Then someday he'll be 14 years old and we have to get the drum set. We don't know how to get it up and running but he likes it. We decided to build a rock band. This is a Rock Band. We'd got some money, but still we waited a while. We thought it would take a little while but ultimately we decided to make fun of it. The first time we played in front of him, I felt a lot like we slept for a few minutes. What else can we do? After a while we were able to watch and play music.","Ben is an avid drum fan and is about to go to college but has been told by other friends that he wants to get a rock band. We made a surprise trip to the rock concert hall and he was really looking forward to it. After going to the concert hall, Ben decided to play the drums. As the drums were playing his brother played with them – he actually looked at the drums in the same way that you would play a guitar or guitar. Then the real concert started. Two years ago we were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'We were very much against the idea because of the noise' Ben argued to the band's manager for the concert hall. It turned out he was trying to put the drums away. Ben was shocked by it anyway because he had so much potential. The rock band's manager refused to buy some more drums so we gave in. In the end we gave in and bought drums.","After listening to the radio for some time, our child wanted to take on a Rock Band. We bought him a set of drums. Our 14-year-old wanted to play with him. He said yes, we gave him the drums. We decided that we needed a set of drums to do his birthday. That night we played Rock Band.","Ben gave us a set of drums. We ordered three for Ben. When Ben rang the bell, the drums were set, which was a very good idea. Ben tried to stomp around on them to see if they were still there, but the drums were too loud and uncomfortable for him to do so. Two years later, we got a few more drums. Our first day of drums was pretty quiet but Ben was excited to see them in action. But he kept being turned away."

B1,People began to keep animals in zoos over 3000 years ago when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally.,"As you would expect, a zoo is an enclosure where visitors can see animals behave in real life. Zoos have become increasingly popular because of the increase in the number of visitors and their acceptance of the need to watch animals from afar. In many zoos people started keeping animals in their own enclosures while the rulers of China didn't want to do this. Today, zoos are often open to tourists and visitors and most visitors will be able to look at animals as animals do not move around during their visits to the zoo. One of the reasons for zoos is that people are not able to see animals because it's so natural that visitors can't see them.","The gardens of intelligence opened in China 5000 years ago. The gardens are a zoo with a number of exhibits for people to see. There are many different types of exhibits from birds to horses to giraffes. They are all natural. They are open to everyone to see and see the animals. It is hard to find a good exhibit in China today, and it is not in any way new. However, some exhibits have been exhibited for over 200 years, and are still there.","People began to keep animals in zoos over 3000 years ago when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. There used to be a large zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the 18th century a zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence remained an important institution of the public. An animal who belonged to the zoo was an animal who had been adopted by zookeepers for many years. As time passed, the animals became more and more of an heir to the zoo. A museum was built around the gardens in 1900 to keep animals alive. They did everything they could in their spare time. Today people still use zoos.","People began to keep animals in zoos over 3000 years ago when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence.

B1,"At Christmas, my family used to live on the street. There were dozens of people around me in town. Our pound is just the same as the dollar or the franc. But now they have money that is more than a gram. A pound is a franc. A dollar is a pound. There are lots of different notes. Sometimes one can exchange money for another dollar, or a pound of candy. So, if you want to exchange money for something else, the money you send back to your family may change its value. Then, the money is given back to you.","The pound, the franc, and the franc are similar in all ways. They are not the same, but are the same money. The difference is that you exchange money for something else. At first, you cannot have more than five pounds of money. They will be around you for days, but eventually you will have more then a few pounds. So, the pound, the franc, and the franc are the same in all ways.","Usually, if there's more than a dollar on a 5 pound note, it will cost you more than a pound. The pound is the equivalent of a gram for a single kilogram. There are a few different uses for the five pound note: It can help to make a book. In order to learn how to make money, we need to understand how money works.","A kid in a classroom in the middle of the school year has found that he is not allowed to use a pound and a franc to buy anything. When his teacher asks him if he can rely on money, he tells him that it makes perfect sense and he understands. He turns to the pound to find the real money.","BRANCH - We usually make money with coins, but you can have coins as well. This shows that coins and francs are very common, so they are widely referred to as currencies. This is the change in the cost of the coin, so coins or francs are used to exchange money for different objects. The problem is that the coins are different, and you don't usually make money using them. When you buy something from a pound or a franc, the cost is much less than the money, so you can't use it more than once. As a result, you may want to know what the difference is.",Using a pound the young child went to the library to buy her a book. His teacher gave him a twenty-pound note because he liked it. He put it on the table. They were surprised that it turned out to be a very good buy.,"MONEY is a form of currency. You can change money for something else. I would exchange it to a book for sweets. At the same time, I would use it to buy something else. I would then use it to buy movies. I would then use it to buy theater tickets. MONEY was very important in teaching children how to use money to buy things."

The new school will be able to run a computer, piano, and a basketball court. However the new building is far from inaccessible. Its not very green because there aren't enough windows to allow people in without permission. When the new building is up to the school building the people working in it have a right to be there. Anna is happy to be able to do this, and she doesn't feel like moving in to make a living. The school will be a great place for my kids to learn, with a great playground. Anna will also be able to cook the meals that they are given. The food is delicious as it contains all the ingredients we need to prepare it. It’s also exciting that the schools have these green rules.","Anna has moved into a new school. She has a new room upstairs besides the classrooms to study in. Her new school is going to be a school with a new school hall, new furniture and new paint. She can play with toys and books inside the school hall.

B1,"There is something very special about Marrakesh that doesn’t require water. The city of Marrakesh does it for many years now. Every year on average its water gets flooded but the springs, fall and spring are different seasons. The weather has been lovely in the past so far but the winters are still so cold that it makes most of the cities dry. The temperature of Morocco can only average 62 degrees, which is average in the country. This means that it is impossible for most people to find a decent supply of water. What we can see today in Marrakesh is a lot less than 84 degrees.","Marrakesh is one of the most populated cities in the world. It was first declared a town in the 1680s and has since been celebrated as a town in the 20th century. It has a very warm climate with warm summers and warm nights. During the onset of the winter, Marrakesh people can use umbrellas to protect themselves from the rains and they are referred to as the sun bearers and typhoons.","During the summer, a hot, dry desert has rained on the city and it is now drizzling again. It seems, however, that the rain has caused the roads and houses to get very dry.","For a long time now, Marrakesh has had a torrential rainfall in the summer. After some watering, the town slowly got rid of the excess rain. However, the rain continues to get a lot more destructive, as it continues to cover the streets and people everywhere. At times, a lot of the streets are full of floods and the people at high risk for loss. One example is the rain: the rain is making streets turn into rivers. Its source is still water. People walk home and continue to swim in the nearby river. And it’s not just the rain; water floats around the people in the surrounding areas. The floods are so bad it irritates the people. The city has a rich past and so do many of its residents and visitors, however, the people they visit are usually not very happy with the situation. Most of the residents are very upset about the conditions, so they don’t bother bringing food.",Marrakesh (Moroccan capital) begins with a rain shower. After this the water can quickly run out. It can make life difficult for people to access water as water is hard to get. With the rain it is very difficult to access water but when a local farmer watering the ground they try. The rain is a rainstorm so it is usually a good sight. There is nothing to see and rain doesn't cause problems to make life difficult for people. This is a popular story in Morocco.,"The local area around the city has a dry desert climate. It is often a dry and arid place. When it does it can turn to the rain, the water pipes don’t know how to handle the floods. This is the reason why locals are very thankful to the locals for their water supply. One of the big attractions of winter in Morocco is the dazzling sunsets of the Moroccan city, in the shaded pastures. This year it is more of a desert setting that is dominated by the sun. Many people also take a chance and try to take a shower during the day, but this is seldom the case. The only rain that occurs in December or January is in the summer when summer is approaching. With the city experiencing its final weeks of rehydration, the waterways in Marrakesh seem to be a little more dry and receptive to the rains.","When it was raining here on a day which included a rainstorm, it had already started. The water had evaporated. People and local people got out of the showers. And when water came, a torrent was rushing down the streets. They hurried across to the next part of town where they got rid of the stomata and then went home. Thankfully the rain stopped the stomata, and stopped the torrential rain."

What's an average meal a day, or how to prepare food everyday? Why do we learn so much about cooking and how to be an amazing cook? We want to be a chef or teacher, or something. How can we do that?

Honey is very sweet!","Bees in Africa, the only countries in the world, are able to see all these beautiful flowers. Some honey makes more honey than others, and they can find some amazing flowers that the rest of the world have not seen. Honey is a sweet liquid which bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to produce half a kilo of honey. Honey is popular because it's light-coloured. The colour and flavour depend on the type of flower visited.","Bees visit over two million flowers every year. Bees are most likely to collect water and sugars on the flowers to produce honey. The honey can be found in the soil in the leaves and in the air. Bees may travel for as long as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. Bees prefer to gather honey on the leaves or flowers and they have special equipment, such as honey-pickers.",Bees were first allowed to collect honey on their own during the spring months when the temperature of the soil seemed to be rising. They then took the honey to a special honey-making workshop near their farm where they studied the structure and health of the honey. The honey then had the effect of moving water and sugars. The bees then made some honey from the honey in order to eat it. The flavour of honey comes from the honey's heat of the honey.,A bee is travelling all over the world to collect honey. He takes one drop each and travels to more than two million flowers to produce only a small amount of honey. A large number of flowers are attracted to honey so he is likely to pick up half a kilo of honey as he travels. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower he goes to visit. He decides to travel and see if it has a particular type of flower.,"A group of people were travelling to Europe and looking for a honey place. They had come across honey that was surprisingly sweet. They were excited, but weren't too sure what it tasted like. One of them found a plant growing in the field and discovered that it had been burned. Then a bee heard it. Bees were very happy that they had discovered a healthy and fresh plant. They had a beautiful and safe spring weather."
B1,"New Writing 3 is an adaptation of Candia McWilliam's short story ""The Woman Who Wasn't Lovin' You"". The book contains a small selection of new writing but it does have a high level of realism, in my opinion. The book also contains a small selection of a few well known writers. In addition the entire collection is based on New Writing and more than 50 stories. This also includes a collection of short stories, and a few other novel books. The book comes with a range of sexy pieces of fiction which would make a good reading companion to our favourite novels of the year. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.","My kids - and I - are delighted to see the new writing range in this year's New Writing collection - now that we can access copies of them. New Writing 3 comes out on April 16, 2013, which is a fantastic deal because some of the material is of the highest quality, and it also includes some interesting short stories. It is published by edgar brown. Some of the book's pieces are very good though. This year's collection is the fourth release and the second collection will go out at the end of this month. I am not particularly interested in the third and fourth books as it includes so many interesting stories. My kids will enjoy the third and fourth collections, despite the low price.","For the past three years, I've been writing stories and novel articles and books. While the reviews on this week's collection are good, these reviews are not the same as those I usually write. The books focus on historical accuracy and are not as much on fiction as they used to be. New Writing 3 is now published in a limited edition for a single book at a fair price. It has a lot of fiction, and more than just fiction. The book's text is rather original and can be thought of in other ways. Sometimes it's a short story and the author's short stories are very good. It's often a long story that tells the story of the story of the author or the character of the author. The books are available at a fair price.","I found the new collection of books from New Writing 3 recently on sale - a collection of fiction and poetry at less than £6.99. This year's collection includes a collection of stories which were originally short stories or full novels (more than 150 pages long). What I liked most in the collection was the variety of writing it included. There are some very exciting and humorous lines which include a list of humour, as well as some rather unusual examples of poetry. They are all published first of all in full English, so I'd prefer to keep them in the library when possible. However, if you enjoy poetry or fiction for at least a year, New Writing 3 definitely is your book to go to.","Originally published in 1982 as New Writing 3, this year's collection is a huge success: it's so original, it's not only well written, but there are still lots of creative elements to add to this collection. I'm not going to lie. I'd already enjoyed it and I enjoyed it more than anyone else. The collection, that I've read, is arguably the most impressive collection on the subject. If you are a fan of contemporary writing, and are looking for something more challenging, New Writing 3 is for you. This summer is the perfect time to try a full set of short stories.",New Writing 3 is a collection of poems by Candia McWilliam. In the first volume of the book the title is written. As I have read the second volume the third one came out. Is it true that both the first and second volumes will be reprinted? Do we really believe that they will continue to be reprinted? And do we really think that it will be useful? Will it be useful if we make a decision now?,"A new collection of novels, essays and short stories for £150 has been released this year. I listened to them all and found them to be enjoyable. I was told that there was a shortage of writers, and therefore there is no need to buy the whole collection. Despite my initial doubts, New Writing 3 is an enjoyable piece of writing. I really enjoyed the piece of writing and it made me realise that I could have written a better story if I listened to the authors' stories."

After a while she stopped to make a connection for a few minutes in the kitchen and was greeted by a lovely lady who looked like she is having a great time in the studio.

B2,Tens of thousands of photos were carved into the rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps after the French Alps was reopened in 1678. It was the site of an ancient dynasty. Researchers and explorers were attempting to make evidence about these ancient treasures. One of the three caves on the rocks are believed to have spooked the ancient drawings because of the large number of them. But the caves are only managed to keep the rocks largely intact. They have been demolished and replaced with gyrene for a more permanent look. Scientists and researchers fear they will need about 3600 drawings to survive.,"In Mont Bego, tourists are avoiding a cliff ledge and going on a ice cube ride. They end up scratching the rock with sticks, sand or something and allowing the art to rot. Tens of thousands of drawings and pictures on the rock in Mont Bego are being gradually destroyed. Scientists have to monitor this. The rocks, however, are protected because scientists are hoping they can still find the art. Why? Because scientists have not rediscovered the pictures yet. They will need to reinterpret and reintroduce them. Researchers fear the 36000 drawings will no longer survive because they are damaged so rapidly. Researchers fear the drawings will die if they are not protected.","Tens of thousands of photos were stolen from an ancient rock art site in Mont Bego, France by tourists in the late 1970s.

B2,"People are complaining about advertisements and ad campaigns as they believe they are getting annoying and stupid. The problem is many people, especially younger children, have an easy time paying attention to them. Young children usually spend their pocket money on things like games and drinks instead of their parents money. There are so many adverts for drinks with cartoon animals in them.",Children spend less money on TV advertisements than younger children. Today most teenagers spend money on TV advertising. Some of the adverts have cartoons instead of reality TV.,"A lot of people see TV adverts on cable. Often, a lot of the adverts are about the children themselves. This may influence children's buying habits. At the same time, adverts are created especially for younger children.","At school, people who are young can often find themselves in advertising. Little kids like to be ripped off, especially as they grow up. As an example, small children are often seen buying products and causing a lot of damage. A lot of children are seen buying things with children in mind. This may be a good thing for some but other children will also notice them. One school is now offering special prizes of food, toys and activities. The children will receive food and then you can give them as a reward. At the moment, some are offered food to buy and most will get a reward of some form if you do some thinking. Some of the programmes are made in mind kids and young people so that they can tack on some of the items that the children can make to help them earn money. Therefore, children are being targeted for many different reasons from the ads. So, for example, adverts for films and TV shows are a common way to show money versus other activities and shows such as buying a game or going to a museum. In some examples, young people spend a lot of money on tickets to a concert or taking a road trip. The children themselves are also able to affect the items that they purchase.","Teenagers are putting ad copies of their favourite TV series on the internet, telling parents that they are spoiling their children and that the advertisements are the products of a malicious corporation. The BBC is a very reputable network that has a good track record of trying to bring children to good home viewing. A simple example would be: ""Luv your kids for half an hour every morning and they will all love your programmes"". There are many TV ads featuring cute cartoons but all the TV advertisements are targeted at young people but all of them are creative and clever. Most children are influenced and there are an increasing number of cartoons which show that there are little children in their family that love getting ad copies of their favorite shows. These children also get to see cartoons for their toys, but still have access to the TV series. The BBC's advice is to use this information to help children learn.",We are getting bombarded with advertisements all the time for ad advertising. Some of them are targeted at young people. This means children are spending too much money to advertise their purchases.,"Young children, if they're not paying their children for what they pay, usually want a drink at a shop. So many TV adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals that seem to be talking to little children. The advertisers thought they were trying to sell a child something that was good for their pocket. If they didn't want that, the advertisers would simply stop having such an advertisement in their children's feed and rip them off. This has led to a decline in advertising and the parents should be concerned about this. A recent study on kids has shown that people who're a little young can take less advantage of children and less money in their pocket."
B2,"You might be thinking, ""What do you need?"" Well, this place in Dublin is for you. I just did a quick search on a cheap apartment and found a good one. You have to assemble up a group of people, and it is easy to find a flat from within the building or the block. There are many benefits, and it's affordable. I'm a bit tired of waiting to find the flat, but it is worth it. There's a resale and there are lots of things to consider in a flat if it's not right for you.","Somewhere between a slicker job and a petty theft, a thief got a new apartment in Dublin. The thief robbed the flat and fled. At the new flat, he told the thief that he had to give the place to the thief. The thief escaped and the flat was broken down. The thief kept stealing. The thief told the thief about the thief. The thief had done a search for a house and when he found it, he decided to take a look. It was worth a try if the thief didn't break down and found the flat at a very low price. Often during a thief's journey, you might find him nearby.","From the moment a new flat was discovered in Dublin, all the places in the world started their search for a good place to live. Most places in Ireland had already been searched and the places could be considered a gold rush. However, in Dublin, we are talking about one of the best places in the world. A lot of places in the world were considered a gold rush. At the beginning of a new year, you look for a place that seems to be a good investment in Ireland, but if you are not satisfied with the old one, you can do nothing for yourself. This is true in Europe and the UK, but all over Europe are considered a silver rush. As a result, many people who were trying to find a place in Dublin didn't make a good choice. At the time, many people thought it would be a lot of fun to rent one. This was an opportunity to look at some possibilities. But, one time, people in Ireland were starting to decide that the best place in Ireland was the best one. Then, in the past, people are always looking for the cheapest place in Dublin, especially in London, where the price is less than everyone expected.","When it was time to sell an apartment, everyone in Dublin was rushing to it. The move wasn't quite ready until they were approached by a surprisingly attractive landlord. While comparing rent to apartment, someone suggested that if you had an old place to live, you might be more likely to find a good deal. The landlord greeted the rented apartment with a chuckle, and started putting away the keys.","It was a great opportunity to move into an apartment in Dublin and get a good lease on the flat. But finding a good flat was hard to find! The rent was high but if you knew someone who had a good time staying in a place where there were always people available you could easily find a better deal. It was hard finding a good place in Dublin at a price you could afford but if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place that often worked, you could easily find a better deal. The best way was to contact a local who knows people that lived there.","It is true that people find gold in this world of gold rushes and it is always worth looking at the gold in the world. Many times one day, the gold rush hits a hard target that is very hard to find. The most expensive and best solution was to appoint someone who knew someone who could leave a place that often worked. It made sense. Those who lived in the Gold Rush, those who lived in the Gold Rush, felt they found gold in the world of gold and gold. The best solution was to make a contact and find someone to deal with these challenges.","The family was in Dublin and found a flat for only $100 a month. The family thought it was going to be an offer from another family that was not very good. After a long chat, the couple sorted out their problem. This helped them get a good deal. They decided to take this opportunity and go to an auction. But they couldn't find a good deal. The best way was to meet someone who knew someone who was leaving a place. If there was only a few options, then they thought of someone who couldn't find a good deal. However, the auction did not work out and the buyers couldn't decide which one to get. At this point, they looked for someone who could put themselves forward."

I asked her if she would like to join them on their first day together. She said no. After 30 minutes I told her that I wanted to meet her and I couldn't believe her for one minute. I went to the store with her and they were talking to different people. We talked about how we look on the first day of the interview. They also said that you don't need to be professional to have a good impression on someone. What I liked about this interview was the people we talked to and how they made them feel. Then I mentioned the first meeting and how the first impression was based on your body language. I told her how we speak as well as how we talk.,"The first interview is important. Many companies offer the opportunity for an interview. The interview should not be rushed. If you have nothing to say, you can tell your boss that you aren't ready. After that, we've got the interview questions. Here are some tips for avoiding this interview.",I met with a colleague on a job interview. I had to make a quick phone call. His face felt a bit sexy. But his first impression of me was good. That is how I first honed my interview skills. He told me that they can make you stand out on interviews. He also learned that people use the internet for interviewing. They will use it during a short videoconference with you. The best way to increase your chances of getting into a interview is to have a few conversations with someone. I'll let him know what you want to say.,"At the interviewees' office, we had a few questions about whether or not the information was relevant. When we arrived at the office, we were told the information was from a professional source. We questioned the person who was putting up a poster that reads ""Reporting the speech and writing.","We are a few months from a new job and we want to make sure that we impress our interviewers. We decided to do this for a couple of weeks and then we decided to discuss them before we started the interview. After that, the questions were a little more advanced. We asked if we were comfortable with the questions and they were both quite accurate. We tried to find out what made each of us come out of the interview thinking positively. We gave in and the other candidate didn't think it was a positive impression. They wanted to make us feel comfortable but didn't want to go. They wanted to make us feel cheated. They want to know how others are going to feel. They asked if we would be comfortable, if we were comfortable, how we would feel after you finished. In the end, we came out of the interview feeling confident and at peace. What other reasons could have we been uncomfortable on a good day? What does the interviewers want to know? How will people like hearing our answers? We've heard how you look, heard how you are feeling, and when you were giving them a bad impression. If we were to give them an impression, they will be willing to listen to our opinions. We know how our personalities change during the interview and how we interact with people. What are these positive factors that we can learn from the interview?","During a conversation, we asked the interviewer about the first impression they made during their interview and she told us that there are many things they can do to make it better. A lot of the questions were just based on the interviewer's experience. We tried to learn as much as possible about the interviewer and would not let us in as a result. We tried to be respectful as much as possible. All responses were based on an impression. The best answer to this question is to try and be respectful. For example, if we have a conversation on a personal level with another person and you have a question about one other person, and you want to ask them about the third person they are meeting at, we probably aren't making any eye contact. If the person tells us that we are a good friend, we may make an impression. The person you are speaking to will most likely be a good friend, so have you make the impression as soon as you go to a meeting. Just in case you have a bad first impression, tell the interviewer to tell the speaker that we are not a friend and you will probably not make an impression."
B2,Raoul went to the theater. She didn't know where she had gone. She just walked out. She grabbed a chair. People stared at the camera. They tried to determine what the event was all about. But they still couldn't figure out what it was all about.,"Raoul was walking to the stage to meet Count Philippe. He saw the young woman, who was wearing a red dress, wearing blue and carrying a small box. Her shoe was wrong and she pushed the box up against her. He grabbed the box and the woman behind her suddenly stopped and turned around. Raoul looked down at Count Philippe and was surprised when he jumped over his knees.","There was a little boy playing an organ. He was crying and was very excited. After a while people seemed to be cheering his song. It was his birthday after school. The next day he went to the school recital. He was excited. But the paper was out of context. It said that he is a teacher and that he can't write his paper. He tried to answer questions from the audience. After the paper was published, the children were asked to write a story.","Raoul was celebrating her 20th birthday and found her friend Count Philippe. He went with her on their evening of magic, and saw it was a jubilee party. He cried out and cried onstage, and people looked at them, hoping the events would be explained. They were surprised that she wanted to have a party, but were told she'd be sent away.","Raoul was going to the movies to see a film. She had never made it to the stage before, so there were a lot of people to look at. She was getting ready for a fight when she saw a man jumping. Raoul kept begging the man to come and put his hands into his mouth. He did so with his mouth sealed shut. Raoul and his family were horrified by this situation. As she waited her turn to leave she saw him running in the distance. She called the police. Count Philippe, looking at her, put his hands in her mouth. He was able to put his hands into her mouth. Raoul tried to calm the situation down. He leaned down and went to the cinema to look at the film. He found a girl in the audience and got ahold of her. She went down with a very claustrophobic look on her face. He asked the director about where he was going, but he didn't give him permission. They then returned to her house and saw her and her friends. They left at once, and they are getting ready to dance. They danced all day.","Raoul was on stage in front of people and she was so excited to be there. On the stage, people were very unprepared for the event. The stage looked unreal. Everyone was clapping for the performers. Count Philippe was standing by. Raoul looked at them.","Raoul went to the opera to watch the film premiere at the New York City Opera. Her sister saw a moment of confusion when Count Philippe fell on Raoul. Raoul asked how Count Philippe looked at Raoul's corpse and she answered, ""Count Philippe! I don't know if you will look in that book,"" and Raoul replied, ""No. She's a young lady. She's a young man."" As the paper unfolded, people thought of them as friends, but then they realized that there were still people present. At the end of the reading, the entire audience threw a coin into the reed, and they all got up with excitement."
B2,"Mark Simmonds reported on the decline of dolphins in the UK. He said the species has been in a decline. He believes that people cannot afford to give up dolphins even though there are still a large number of them. He said there were some large calf and the UK government didn't think the population would increase by half in the next few years. Some people have travelled to the area to see and hear about dolphins but they say they have been very cold, which can halt the growth of the species. Mark Simmonds, who teaches at schools around the world, told the BBC that the dolphins are very lucky to live in a local wild area. He also told the BBC that they are very hungry and the world would be a better place because they can live in that way. This year Mark Simmonds reported that there was an increase in seal numbers during the last year but he wanted to warn people to take care.","Mark Simmonds has spent the last 25 years living off the coast of New Zealand observing dolphins, which he considers a rare find. While most people like to see dolphins in the seaside marinas, it is hard for most people to imagine the pain that it has to experience. Even in rural areas such as New Zealand, the sight of dolphins still attracts people to their place of employment. But dolphins are not the only animals in this world that are losing their habitats. In a recent study of 1,500 dolphins in a protected area, some experts say that the habitats in these regions are endangered. Mark Simmonds says that many of these animals are now in captivity, which means that they need to keep growing on their captivity to avoid deforestation. Mark believes that while many dolphins live in protected areas, their habitats are being destroyed by humans, including some marine animals. There are numerous evidence that the animals have been deforested in recent years. He suggests that when an animal starts losing its habitat, it is very likely to be endangered. He adds that the loss of these animals is very serious. How do humans understand that there are no dolphins there? How does that change the dolphins life cycle, and how does this affect the dolphins? He finds that the dolphins live in protected areas where there are less places to live, such as parks or local beaches. He also investigates how the dolphins interact with one another. These dolphins have a unique way of communicating with each other. Mark Simmonds reports that a dolphin can transmit more than 1200 tones across one finger, and is only attracted to fish in the aquarium. As they live, they move about from one water line to the other. If humans can see the dolphins swimming in the water, they are infected. If the dolphins are defenetrable, they are not capable to reproduce. How do we communicate with each other?","When a dolphin turns away from an airship, he is seen with a smile from his mouth which then vanishes. The dolphin's head remains with the airship on his lap, which is being used as a window. The whale and dolphin conservation society has told the BBC that the dolphin's head is now being scraped at with a chainsaw. Whale and dolphin Conservation Society members were pleased to hear the Dolphin's smile reflected in the a-frame.","We have been following the dolphins since they were a young child. Now it is our turn to raise our interest in the whales. The dolphins are thriving in protected areas. But there is something terrible about the way we avert the dolphins' predicament. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas, films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate.

Why not have the dolphins at our home? The whales are a precious part of our oceans and are the richest. That's where we find our love. We see it in films and TV programmes like Life in the Blues and The Whales on Sunday mornings and even on television. The whales love these little creatures too much for some of our enjoyment. That is where our love grows and the story gets bigger.,"Mark Simmonds is a reporter at The Guardian who publishes news about the plight of the whale and dolphin. He interviews the subject of dolphins and outlines the problems faced by them, such as their habitat and food preferences. The writer then uses the story of a young woman and her father. She says that they can see her husband drifting on a small beach if they are not looking at her husband or their family or her cat. The story is accompanied by the story of a young woman getting bitten by a dolphin that is being looked at by a man. The film, which is being aired on Channel 4, had a strong positive spin and highlighted the topic of dolphins, such as them, in the news. The whale and dolphin Conservation Society published a story about the decline of the species, which is said to have been caused by neglect by people and the natural disasters of the past. He interviews the author, a doctor, about a particular dolphin who is being looked at by the family. The reader is told the story by a man with a dolphin in tow and is about to give an impression of their age. He then asks her if the news is true. She explains that in most cases when the species of dolphin is out of focus she receives the wrong message, telling her he has gotten so far. She then responds by saying the news is false and her daughter is not yet the same as her. She then asks how we can keep the dolphins alive. The dolphins are found around the world. In the past, it was thought that they were abused to keep lifeless, but they have survived and are protected. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has published a report on the decline of the species."
B2,"My research of over 150 years shows that we are not in the time to really talk to people when they need to. When I was growing up, I didn't want to be a big computer person anymore, or ever. As a teenager I was obsessed with technology, and it was difficult to afford electronics. I wanted to study how it is different from real life. I got an Internet degree from a local computer university. My friends liked being online because I liked being in touch with my friends. They were all interested in what I wanted to do, and some of the people that I'd talked to liked the idea of being in touch with their friends. I also like how there is no connection to people on a computer. They enjoy the feeling of being connected, but don't feel comfortable talking online. I have a problem when it comes to relationships, such as getting a job, having a boyfriend, having a baby, etc.","Throughout my adult life, I've been focusing largely on how to write my own articles and books. Today I am focusing on the writing process, editing and illustrating a number of books and columns. My research shows that people often feel like they don't have time for conversation, which has been documented on a variety of other websites over the last 15 years. The writer of the research has tried various formats to try and connect these two fields, but unfortunately they don't work. These texts can come from a wide variety of sources and from different books and magazines. In conclusion, these texts were written for someone wanting to make a brief social comment or to share a thought.",Recently I've had a little chat on my mobile phone. When a guy walks by me while I'm working he suddenly hears something that's in his brain. The next day he finds out that there are things that he can be doing around the house. After he listens I can see things I don't want to do like interacting with people. I'm a little depressed and really need to rest. My research has shown that for many online life and smartphone connections have got in the way of things that people feel are important. We're so busy communicating that we don't have time to think we don't have time to sit down and have a conversation.,"A friend of mine took her home and invited her to a dinner on a date. When she got there, she met many people who were busy doing it all alone. When she finally arrived, she was able to ask for their help. We met in the coffee shop, and then had dinner.","My research found that online life and smartphones have put us in a lot of control over our lives online. It's important to pause to think about our interactions. For me it is important to sit down and have a conversation with one another, but at the moment when I'm stressed out with all the work on my plate, I feel less productive and less productive. This is the only time when I can actually do anything.","We are largely busy at work in the world. We have many different connections online. You have your mobile phone, your computer, and your smartphone. We often use them to connect with people from different backgrounds. When we connect, we feel obligated to connect and connect. Over the past fifteen years my research has documented that we're so busy communicating that we don't have time to sit down and have a conversation.","My research shows that the most important things to communicate have already been forgotten by the general population, resulting in a generalization describing one's habits in general to a behavioural psychologist and another to a psychologist. It is the logical conclusion that people are overly focused on technology or communication. Most people do not have time to think or have a conversation. My understanding is that for much of modern society we may not have time for discussion if it is overcrowded. My current work shows that the effects of new technology on people's lives have largely been reversed despite the benefits of having a talk with their friends."

He told his mother that he was mad about her. The queen thought he was a bit rude and refused to give her a name because he was afraid of mistreating his father. She said she had the wrong name. She had already given him a very dear and respectful name - Father and Queen. But she had thought it was a serious thing. Hamlet replied that she didn't care as much as her father and the truth was that she knew what her father did.

B2,Charles Darwin wrote a book on evolution that inspired many people to go on the run. He went on to define human life as a whole by observing biological animals living on the edge of their habitats. Darwin described the process of natural selection in a way that many modern scientists had never experienced. Darwin authored In the Origin of Species in 1859 which was published the next year.,"One day, I saw Charles Darwin walking around at a forest. I got to know him in one of his books. He looked around the forest looking for the ""fittest."" He saw it and told me it was Darwin's theory on evolution that transformed the way humans view the world. He explained that the way people view life was a result of Darwin's theory. He described Darwin as being a man who had a gift: a brilliant inventor, naturalist, sailor, and naturalist. He explained that the people of his time, in his works, were also the people of the future. The men of the future were Darwin and the young men of the future. He explained that if you love something and have something to do, it is only your choice. He then presented his theory to a crowd. He also talked about how he was a revolutionary scientist. Darwin's theory was controversial until early modern times when Darwin was the editor of Nature magazine. His theory led to the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859.",Charles Darwin helped plant a lemonade plant. Charles Darwin began a movement in 1859 to plant the lemonade plant. He had to come to Chile to prepare it. The plant grew. Darwin stayed in Chile until 1862.,"Charles Darwin believed a perfect tree that lived at the edge of a forest is called a ""Dawn Tree"". Charles Darwin and his friends had a picnic with their friend Mr. Rogers, so they decided to do something about their tree. They then took out some logs and saw it on the tree's surface. They thought that the tree had been damaged. After the tree was damaged, they put out a fire. The fire burned the logs. The children wanted to leave them to the fire. However, their friend, Mr. Rogers, had been waiting for them to return. He turned away, causing the tree to split off. The children and a lady, Maggie, decided not to go to sleep. Maggie put the logs away, and while they were on the tree, the embers melted. They tried to climb onto the tree as they fell. But the embers began to fall. The embers were pushed in and a burning flame broke out. The fire burned the logs. Maggie then ran in and found the tree and its branches burned. The tree was finally killed in a blaze. The children wondered if a tree had survived.","Charles Darwin was the oldest of the four brothers who developed the theory of evolution that brought about the most significant evolutionary change of the past century. These two brothers were very similar when the three brothers, the oldest, resisted the idea. They shared the same philosophy - the theory of natural selection. The Darwinists believed that an organism has a natural selection process if he has a selection pattern. This process allowed the organisms to develop new characteristics that were important to the species. The Darwinists believed that the 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - were more likely to survive and reproduce.","Darwin was very knowledgeable of evolution. He introduced a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the world and we see ourselves. The evolution theory he gave is based on natural selection. It is a concept with a philosophical and philosophical basis. The evolutionary theory he developed was not completely a science. The theory was a controversial one. It influenced Darwin's work. It was thought to be controversial, and did not take the scientific viewpoint seriously.","Charles Darwin taught his students to study natural selection, based on the discovery of a variety of physical properties of the natural world. His book On the Origin of Species was published two years later. He described that certain animals or plants are more likely to survive and reproduce. In his book, Darwin presented his theory of evolution: a process of natural selection based on natural selection or natural selection. When they were able to get their ideas published, they discovered that these traits were the 'fittest', the characteristics that were the most valuable to their animal or plant species. Charles Darwin's book also made comparisons with this process. Charles Darwin is a scientist and he had extensive knowledge of natural selection and evolution in plants. These observations were very important in his work."
B2,"Our family visited Ireland last June to celebrate the end of the year. While searching for a perfect holiday, the group decided to have a night's stay at Glencorn Lodge. The accommodation was fantastic for the 4 of us, not to mention the great view of the Northern Ireland countryside from their cosy log cabin. Our stay at Glencorn Lodge came with a price, so for the most part it was cheaper than the rest of our hotels in the resort.","We were really looking forward to our holidays together. We had been planning for a few months, so we shopped around town. We didn't know much about Ireland until we were a couple so we started planning to visit every single state and city we could.

Then we decided that we'd be traveling to the island in Northern Ireland. At Glencorn Lodge we were near the coast. My room was beautiful and modern. The rooms had no TV's or DVD's that you can take care of. Our first day in Ireland we saw something strange, a giant sea turtle. We found out it was a sea turtle and we were excited. It was so beautiful. Then we had decided that we would go to a town of Ireland. We decided to go to Ireland. Our first night was in the port town of Belfast.

That evening we decided to travel back to Ireland to see family. When it opened, we discovered that it was in County Antrim. We decided to spend the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. We wanted to stay in County Antrim for two weeks before we headed over there for a break. We finally found this house and had to move to Belfast.","We decided we were going to Ireland. We did all the activities we had decided to do on our summer break. There we met other couples. We spent two weeks at Glencorn Lodge, which is located by the sea on the island of Antrim. We went on the road trip to Antrim by raft or motor cycle. We climbed a castle, went on a sailing trip and went to the beach, drank a lot of water and did something special. We spent about five days there. We decided to eat all the food we had brought home. This was our first trip to Ireland. We opted for a night out. We all went back to Ireland."

However, the problem was small and the problem was not always easily solved. In June, the world's largest conference saw the world's first computer network. The world's largest computers were not only being used, they had been used to control the Internet. But before the ARPAnet began to grow, it became more and more difficult to network one's computers. Since the ARPAnet didn't fully understand how computers could function, some of them would have run into trouble. Therefore, it was needed to change how computers behaved. After a long time, other networks began to appear, becoming more popular in the world.","The network ARPAnet was built to help people find computers to use for the research and use for the computers on the planet. Today a huge effort has been made to build more computers and to give computers a better experience. On Friday the ARPAnet was introduced. Since the first computers made computers, all of the computers in the network were free and there was an initial setup fee of $480. The first computers had to be built in order to be fully used, but only one computer could make the connections to the network. All computers had to be developed by the university and could be used for research. The conference attendees learned that the ARPAnet was the world's first computer network. They also learned that the other networks could be developed as well. The world's first computer network was the National Broadcasting System. The.net and the.net began combining to make computers useful. Computers can then receive and display radio stations. They can be broadcast for free. But because the Internet had a bad reputation they lacked the ability to talk to each other. This caused many people to develop a new and advanced network. It was easy to build a network to communicate with each other through the Internet. However it is very hard to build a network to receive, as everyone around the world can use computers to communicate and use them. However, many computer users now realize that the network can be used for scientific purposes as well. This is because the network can easily share information with anyone from all over the world. ARPAnet has remained a popular computer network for many years.","This story is a snaffle in the brain. A student was invited to an American conference to talk about how to make use of a computer network. He came to the conclusion that the network needed some improvements. He was surprised to find out that the new network was only able to connect two computers. During the conference the computer network that was connected to the web was much more sophisticated. At the end of the conference everyone involved was amazed at what they could achieve. However the problem was all very small and no one really took it to heart. The next day the conference was organized and everyone was pleased to have made use of the computer network. One of the experts on the conference talked about the use of computers and the ARPAnet. In a way the computers that are used for the conference were very simple, easy to use, and affordable to use. At the end of the conference the computer network broke down and everyone was shocked to see how simple it actually was. The conference was not very successful.","A computer network had been built at a conference. Now they could start a computer network. The ARPAnet network used computers, computers and computers to create a network between the computers. The ARPAnet network was part of a network of computer networks, which were mostly students in the classrooms, which had been re-designed and improved and added more and more complex devices.","A group of friends decided to build an ARPANET and build it themselves. However, many problems started to appear. The smallest problem was the time it took to get the computers on the network. The world was in crisis due to the computers malfunctioning. It took many weeks to build and in some cases even weeks to begin to get computers on the network. After a few months the number of problems increased and the computers began to build properly. However, the computers did not start to run at all. The new computers did not have to worry about the trouble. The only problems on the network were the power and the lack of communication. Some were still not sure how to build the Internet but other devices like the ADT computers were able to support the network."
B2,"Chris Greener went to school with his bf to learn how to be an astronaut. His principal told him it took 12 years for him to graduate, so he decided he wanted to join. Chris told his teachers he would need a degree in science and physics. He agreed and was accepted. He thought that by going to school he would have to go to the next part of school.","Chris Greener was fifteen when he told his parents he wanted to become an officer in the Royal Navy. His teacher had a point, but Chris only really twelve! So, one day, he asked his parents to make him a chaplain. With no money or any sort of hunchback, Chris agreed to his father in law's family. His father agreed! The family then set a date for an opening ceremony of the Royal Navy.","Chris Greener wanted to join the navy but his teachers told him too much - so he left the school. The new school year is not as bright as it used to be. He started thinking of becoming a cadet instead, and ended up getting in some good grades.

He tried his best to make up for his height. He ended up smacking in the head on the back of the table and leaving. Chris’s teacher knew that he was too thin for the boots. He offered to buy him an all-rounder to take out to sea with him. However, with Chris’s help, he made up for the shortfall. The navy's flagpole was on the table in his school hall, as it was actually on the flagpole at school. However, Chris felt he was being too heavy for his boots! After several weeks on the beach, Chris finally got into the Navy. At school, he learned to read, but despite being tall and skinny, his feet were still able to fit in. Eventually he hopped aboard a Royal Marine and joined the Navy. He was selected for the US Navy as a candidate for the Marine Corps and was eager to join the Marines as a companion during the invasion, while also taking part in a sand dune. He was also hoping to juggle school work and a sailing career before becoming a marine.","Chris was a teenager. He studied for his engineering exam. It was a huge decision. He wanted to be a captain. So he turned to his teacher - to ask what he would do in the navy. The teacher took a cue from Chris, 'Why are you so short?' He was asked if he had a story to tell about the navy. 'It might be very exciting. I’m afraid it’s difficult for me. I have the nerves. I won’t come, I don’t know, you should not get out of me' The teacher was quite right. 'Are you going to be a captain?' the teacher asked, 'yes.'",Chris was told he needed an extra pair of boots in order to keep fit. He was 14 and could stand on his feet and couldn’t walk and couldn’t do anything like climbing. He made his big dreams come true and made his dream come true as he didn’t need a pair of boots to make it. His aims were to go to the navy. To join a navy is a dream.,"Chris wanted to join the navy when he was twelve. His parents decided to keep him for five years because his mother was a former navy colonel and she had to work at the Navy. As a result, he had to wear a pair of boots to school so he could walk on the coast. When he left school he thought that he had no time for sports. The next day he got a letter from his school. He was hoping to join a cadet union but she refused. He had already joined the navy in the last year of his college career."

John's response was: ""No, he's a chef, and he's been cooking."" John replied yes to the offer. I had told John Moore that he had no intention of taking on the role of the host of the shows, but he offered me an apprenticeship to make a living as a restaurant owner.

Until now he has only a pedometer, a watch, a tape recorder, and a brisk speed.","Hicham El Guerrouj ran at 5,000 m per hour as Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj took the 1500m title in 1998. The race was held in the open air for the first time in its history. In an era of speed records, El Guerrouj's first time was 3 minutes 30 seconds.

He starts by explaining that he doesn't want to do a jump. He is a slow runner so it takes some training to keep up his speed. He shows people how to run at the speed limit. He gives an example of how a slow runner would run. He tells how he has done the same before and explains the limits of the human body. He also explains about the limits of the human body. He talks about how he believes that everyone can run on the same speed level, but he also explains that a slow runner would be slower.

He explains the limits of a human body during a race.","Hicham El Guerrouj ran 1500 metres at his own speed. So when his time was third in the world, nobody had to beat that time. To add to the feat, nobody is ever faster than Hicham El Guerrouj. So why is it so strange that nobody has ever beaten that time?","Hicham El Guerrouj used a frog from the ashes of the ashes of his father and grandfather to train to do the 1500 meters hurdles, which were once the world's fastest hurdles hurdles.

As I was peeling the vegetables to make a small dish, I was surprised to find a little piece of cake. I kept thinking about it as I read a recipe from the cookbook. When I looked at the menu, I knew I had chosen something special. I decided to go ahead and start with something simple. Then I got a slice of cake. That looked like something about a chocolate cake. And that cake was something to say about how yummy it was. I think it looks yummy too. That's how it's supposed to be. I know it tasted good but I don't think I'd be able to eat that cake this time. But I think its the perfect recipe for the family. After all, we've all seen it before but the recipe hasn't come together yet. It's not a recipe you can make with just plain white cake. This is a recipe you can make with chocolate cake, or with cake that's actually more traditional. My friend made this a few years ago. But I don't think it's the same from the cookbook. So I think this recipe is a little different than what I expected it to be. What would happen if I was the cook next to a friend of mine? If I were ever asked to think of something you haven't seen before, I would be extremely excited.","The British cookbook publisher, Ewoks, is going to publish a new selection of cookbooks.

The local television channels had nothing on Buckley, except pictures of Buckley, with no news about the Hailey trial. Jake sat down to the news after the news conference, not knowing what to expect.

B2,"Pop stars have been photographed using an intruding photo in their magazines. They show a number of photos which look similar but it is not typical. Most tabloid readers don’t like this type of photography because of the cost. Pop stars are portrayed frequently as the ‘reality queen’ as well as posing for attention and they appear on the front pages in their magazines. Many tabloid publications have images of other people they are not around. This means the pictures could cause their personal privacy to be devalued. Some people do pose for paparazzi for money. However, that is often not the case.","One day a reporter of a tabloid newspaper saw an image of her brother's face reflected in the front page of the newspaper. The person referred to it as being “stunning.” One of her photos was taken he then posted in the newspaper and eventually appeared on the front page of her newspaper. She made her comment and told her mother he never saw an image of her. Later he said he was simply looking out for her. In the photo she turned to her father who looked at her and said he had a picture of herself. He then said he would take it and be proud of it. The photo was taken by a policeman who looked at her and gathered some evidence to help him. His suspicions turned against his father, saying he saw her as a scapegoat. His wife had also looked at the photo. He said he was going to take it over to her father so he would get her back. His parents saw the picture and then the police arrived and he stepped out of the window to let them know he was being photographed. Both were surprised to hear that the pictures were being taken. They didn't feel as if they were taken seriously. They did not take it seriously and made it look serious. Later he went back to the front page and noticed the pictures were clearly being taken by a photographer. The photo was taken when he came back to his work from the back of the newspaper which had appeared last month. He had no idea what the photos were or had taken beforehand and had taken them that day. While there were some false pictures of the photo and many of the photos, he continued to snap them. The other photos were taken during the day when he took pictures of his work. The photographers caught up with his clients to see how they looked at the photos, and how they looked at them. He then came to a conclusion that although the photographs were in the media, their quality and their use of the images showed the journalists' disregard of the rules of the practice. The pictures were taken to provide a distraction from the daily life of the newspaper editors and to be seen and reflected back in their editor's office. He decided that his job was not to steal their photos and focus on their content, but to make people's life easier by exposing their very private moments in the public eye.","Pop stars posing for paparazzi are photographed by tabloid newspapers and discarded on the front page. While posing for paparazzi the people on the page are being harassed and people are harassed by paparazzi as they are not allowed to interact. This is how tabloid media treat people and to their private time. It is important to stop these pictures from circulating. While tabloid publications treat people on the front page as unwanted and unwanted, tabloid newspapers feel the need to avoid these. This makes it much more difficult to regulate the contents of a tabloid paper unless your news feed is completely protected.","In The Wall Street Journal, a group of people are arrested for stealing a camera. They are charged with criminal damage. The film has been called a prank on the editor and the person responsible. The public is now being resentful of the journalist's actions. Some people were arrested because of their video pictures. Others are taking their own pictures. The reporter believes that it is a crime to shoot the camera. But the video clips are not all that dangerous. This is a dangerous practice - no one is allowed to see their private pictures. The government's investigation is still underway. The judge ordered the organisers to give the video clips and leave it at the station for the cameras. The video clips were taken in the studio and they were then taken to be edited. The government asked the journalists to edit the video and they did so. It was only in the studio that the video was released. The reporters were concerned about the picture and refused their whelpers' help. The reporter called the police but they resisted as there was no way he could get the truth. The prank was caught on video and police confiscated the video. The journalist was reprimanded but the court agreed to let the reporter reappear. The jury convicted the journalist of making video clips with the help of the security camera. The film was released on a later date.","Newspaper editors in England carry tabloid articles. They often use photos taken from pop stars who are not present. When they receive pictures, they often write about them. Many people can read these articles because they think they can be useful for the public. Other tabloid publications also print stories about celebrities and pop stars who are not present in newspapers. These photos often break newspaper editors’ code of practice. In some places, journalists can write about celebrity events, or celebrity owners posing in photos. Usually, journalists take photos that make people feel comfortable, which they do.","All the tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people’s privates, but they never make a public announcement. It's too often that people in public eyes get to see their most private moments on the front page. The editors often want the newspaper to stop publishing pictures which break the editorial code. It's time for the tabloids to stop publishing pictures which break the editors' code of practice. It's time to end their controversial practice and keep the tabloids happy.","News agencies use tabloids to carry pictures which intrude into people’s privacy and break the editors’ code of practice. One newspaper, London Gazette, said this year that the editors are concerned about this. The critics say the images were published after the editors of other tabloids asked about their opinions. What is a tabloid newspaper’s policy on capturing the most public images taken of pop stars?"

B2,Veronica Lee made a bed for a child in her parents' chalet in Sussex and spent the whole day working at the chalet. Then the holidaymakers asked her to pick up something to eat and cook for their children. She had already been working at the children’s chalet and thought she’d be a good model. Thankfully she has a job at the chalet - where she’s not happy about her work.,"Sarah Sutherland-Pilch’s parents are in the UK and her father is in New York. Her best friend and classmate Emily and her parents are doing housework at the same time. They work very hard all the time for their parents and she is always very busy. But when it comes to holidays, she still always works late at night. Sarah says it’s not just her job to muck her up and sleep. She says the best part of her job is making beds. Veronica Lee is the sister who works at the house. The week before her husband Andrew has left, Veronica asked Sarah if she could go for a walk, but she said yes! The two of them were busy at work making beds and dining. Sarah said it took 30 minutes so she was so relaxed. She is now working full time at the time but has started working once again as a chalet girl.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl who goes by the name of “Scotty”. She is also a vegan - but her family don’t have any access to gluten. She is now going to the kitchen to pick up food for her family at work. On Sunday she runs into Lucy, who is a very shy and social young woman who never makes it home to the chalet on holiday. Sarah is also working as a cook on the chalet. They are hoping she can give them the chance to have a great holiday. This is the second year for the chalet girl for Sarah - a 24-year-old from West Sussex.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a spoiled teenager from West Sussex, who wants to be a skier. The two have a lot to do together. However, they’re not always the best choice for each other, with the result that Sarah, her little sister Sarah and her little brother are frequently referred to as ‘the big boys’. Sarah’s work is always changing between the hours of day when she works, as well as the times when she has plenty of time at home to indulge. Sarah has spent a long time putting her mind to different things, so she makes sure she is always making the best of every task. Sarah’s work is always different, and she often spends much of her time trying new things. She often asks why her parents often find her too ambivalent about the things she likes and ignores, but in this case she always wants to find the things she should be interested in. The day before her trip, Sarah runs into an older brother, who hasn’t been to a snowy weather event, and has to deal with her parents rather than them - and they’ve never asked her to do anything. But once at home, she’s still having fun in her bathing suits and a hat. But she’s not always sure what to expect next. This year’s holiday season begins on Thursday, after Christmas, with her swans swimming ashore in the pond at her grandparents’ house. At first she thinks it’s an easy decision to change the weather - because of how little they spend all year getting to know one another. But one day, with Sarah, the swans have to agree on a plan to enjoy a winter holiday in Italy – a country town and holiday surrounded by countless snowy mountains. Now Sarah asks Veronica Lee if she thinks it’s OK to change her mind about it, because this time of year is the one when it truly matters - there are so many things to do. Sarah tries it every day and then she makes an exception to that decision. It is at the weekend and she starts to think about it and then she starts. Her parents are always so supportive and they offer her much needed help in the house, especially when she asks about her future with skiing and holidays in the mountains.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch from West Sussex is one of the favourite holidaymakers. During holiday season, she has her own chalet to her name. Sarah says 'She never has an end in sight, there are nights when you can't wait to come and be helped'. While she's working, Sarah sits near her house in front of the fire with the fire going off and has to climb back down as she waits to get out of the way to make the final. The children love it - it's very easy to work up the courage to make an appointment to go on holiday despite the craziness that ensues. She also had a huge amount of fun - playing croquet on the trampoline, the sassy red bull run, the huge red horse, the big cockroach and more. She also loves mending the snowman on the way down to the zoo.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, 24, says her role at the holiday-maker camp, Aote, has been an amazing success. She has made many friends and got to do things with them. Sarah works as a chalet girl - a lady in particular - in between making beds and delicious dinners. Sarah Sutherland-Pilch wants to be a successful mother and be responsible, so she works as a schoolgirl. Sarah tries the family meals at the Campfire Club. Sarah says the hut has fun parties, food and crafts and a stuffed bear. The girls have a lot going for them.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 12-year-old who is not afraid to be creative. Sarah Sutherland-Pilch was a girl at first but was very excited to get into a world of creative play and the arts. But soon she was inspired to join the local 'Castle Girl' club. While working at the local pub Sarah has to make her home in her new chalet, the girl that manages the club. After having the 'Castle Girl' club for the weekend, Sarah decided to make a trip to the new house to help get things started. This year she spent more time in the kitchen and working out in the dining room. At first she loved it because it was so beautiful and she was so relaxed and did not need to worry too much about going home. Sarah had a good job to complete, taking part in the fun. Sarah asked Veronica Lee, who has taken her to some beautiful places on holidays. Veronica was impressed by Sarah’s enthusiasm and told her she is the lucky one when she sees a future of the chalet girl."

B2,"The Norwegian coast and the Nordic nations have been involved in the ancient art of ice skating. The ice skating industry has always been a place for artistic expression and recreation. In the 20th century, there were thousands of artistic disciplines. In the Nordic world, it is a very popular activity with the Nordic upper classes. Archaeologists have discovered that skates made from animal bone. Archaeologists have discovered that skates made from animal bone were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill.","Some people have been interested in skating for several centuries. During this time, many archaeologists have discovered that skates made from animal bones could be a useful tool in the production of ice and snow. During the ice and snow era, ancient people in Scandinavia started skating in the early 20th Century. They had found all the bones in their bones from animals who had migrated from Denmark to Scandinavia and moved back in time. After this, skates were often used in use to train their students for competition. In the 20th century, people in Scandinavia began using all kinds of new equipment such as skates to practice making ice and snow. Today, the ice skating technology in use by the upper classes of Scandinavia is still being developed. The ice skate system still relates to the ancient technique of using ice and ice in building ice sculptures in an ancient building.

Today, the number of people that practice is staggering for many people. One study said that the earliest human skates were made from animal bone. The others had similar names. Archaeologists were looking at skates until the early 1700s. The discovery made about a hundred years ago, and this is the most famous article that they've come up with. What was in there, it's been made from? How old are the bones in ice skating? The bones are made from steel rods that were made from bone and then melted into another type of ice skate.

It may have been a skill that was first learned in Scandinavia, but skating at a higher rate at the time was considered more important than the art and craft of skating itself. It has long been practised by archaeologists in Scandinavia because they believe it is the activity of skating to keep the body from becoming damaged. A further study by archaeologists in Scandinavia is due to arrive at more specific information. It turns out that bones were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia in 200 AD, and the use of bone skates was first noticed when there was an outburst in the early 1920s when scientists tried to find a method of creating skates. The research was funded by a Swedish community, the Swedish National Art Gallery, and Swedish Science, Arts, and Cultural Studies. The Skating Board has been set up, and in its honour, the Skateboard Museum provides an insight into the history of Ice Skating."

She guessed that the team would get through to the World Championships in London. I caught up with Kendra Slawinski and learned about her. The Netball Captain is captain of England's netball team.,"Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. Kendra's a local teacher so it doesn't take too long for her to be able to train.

B2,"The girl is a young student in her eighth grade who hopes to be an elite runner. She hopes to compete at next summer's Summer Olympics. On Wednesday she competed 1500 metres, 20 km, and 70km at the London Games. The competition was cancelled but the girl has decided not to compete. She also has a keen love of mountain biking and swimming. She wants a team to train her for the Olympics. The only training partner is a sports-mad teenager who loves endurance.","A schoolgirl was trying to win over a potential Olympic champion by swimming 1500 metres but she didn't know how. Her coach told her she needs to go somewhere where the distance will be safe. She decided to swim, cycle, swim and then run. She swam 1,100 meters on 10 days. She has been competing for two years but has not been to a major tournament yet. She wants to compete at the world championships.","Teenager Jenny wanted to start a triathlon. Her interest turned to cycling. A potential competitive competitor offered her a role in a triathlon. Jenny's interest was reflected in her training schedule and her desire for a triathlon partner. It was one of Jenny's goals. When the training began she realised she had a craving for endurance. Her heart rate quickly plummeted. She decided to try a 200m sprint to the Olympic Games and then finish it in 14 km. The team's captain urged the team to take it seriously. The sprinting was a huge success and a team member agreed to take her up on a challenge. She was told the training was a good fit and she would do well. The competitions were all good fun, but a challenge had come only last one minute. When the training was over, Jenny asked for more endurance - if she really wanted a training partner she was asked to work with someone preferably female. Jenny's future coach said she should also be keen on getting her own equipment and strength. The training was a success and the only downside was that her coach was in competition in the summer. He'd already had to run the 1000m in 20 km at the last moment. The team member would be happy to do the 3 - 15km. Jenny was confident that she can do this well, but she slammed the training plan on their face. But her goal was to achieve something she was happy with. However she had a bad case of bad heart rate and she didn't know it. The team leader refused to let her go and he advised her to be honest. Jenny has already met another triathlete, a 17-year-old. Jenny offered to have her take part in a Triathlon and asks to make a bid. She was interested in joining a triathlon club, but had a different opinion on how to proceed. At the end of the training session, she was asked to re-evaluate the plan. She had been doing 5-10 km during the training. She was so impressed with her fitness that she asked for a full and comprehensive cardiovascular assessment to help guide her through.","Teenager, a schoolgirl who loves to train in the water, wants to get her mind off water skiing as a part of a training cycle. She decided the challenge was to do 4 days of exercise a week. The idea started after her mother decided she was too young for the training bike. She decided to just focus on swimming and cycling. The result was a long training cycle which started on Friday and finished on Wednesday. She had run 2 hours per week, 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the apron. The competition was so fierce that she pushed out of her way to finish with 15K in a lap. To her delight she decided to be ready for an Olympics. She also trained with an Olympic champion who represented her country. Then, she started a group of 15 kilometers in a sanity trial.","One week after a triathlon competition, a 14-year-old girl is ready for the event. He looks for a partner, who will help him build a triathlon. He wants to become an avid triathlete, but needs to understand how to fit in and prepare well for the event. This teenager is very bright. He must be able to work with the Olympian as long as he is interested in the sport and his athletic abilities are strong enough. What he wants to do is take part in the races, which involve the running or swimming event. He must be prepared to go through the gruelling training to build his endurance. He will use his time to try out their new racing abilities. Currently, there aren't enough women competing in the triathlons to compete at this level. The current ranked American Triathlete has the least time in the world. The female racer has a small time compared to the males and will be prepared to take part in the events if her time is up. A biathlete with a passion for racing can also compete. A triathlete needs to have a strong interest in training, but she isn't as keen on endurance. She is now hoping to reach the semi-finals and have a chance to train with a potential Olympic champion.",Six - year-old boy wanted to become a triathlete in order to train. She wanted to make friends and enjoy her own time. He was a college student and wanted to be a physical therapist. He has a passion for distance running. He volunteered at a triathlon centre. He would train as long as the schoolgirl wanted to run. He wished they would get a chance to work with a female Olympic champion.,Currently a schoolgirl is taking part in the marathon competition. She is a schoolgirl whose favourite sport is track and field but hates tackling outdoor obstacles. She does not want to do this and was given an opportunity to train with the high level athlete. This is for the potential Olympic champion who has previously set many athletes up. The teenage girl with the perfect heart rates and a keen sense of motivation should be very willing to work with a qualified professional triathlete. She does not want to have to spend an entire summer competing in competition and the Olympic selection process can be complicated. She should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions) and distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage).
B2,"At least on news websites it's hard to find what's going on. Well last week I was able to find some information about a strange news article. I turned to the Daily News for an option. There are 3.5 million articles a day, including those on the financial and sports pages. Now I have to re-watch all this and I am terribly sick. I have to say it has taken me almost two hours to finish all of my work on Monday. What I was doing was wondering if I had found a story. And now I have to say that Reuters is the source of it. I had been reading the whole newspaper, including the financial and sports pages. Then on Sunday the whole news page was loaded. And after I got off it I saw 3.5 million pieces of news. So I had to make a final decision. Reuters just puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. And that's just one source. I'm not sure if they have enough content to keep it afloat. In any case, if the daily edition of the Reuters paper has more news than they have in years. For example, it has 18,000 articles a week, plus 1,200 video pages. This means it has about 3.5 million in its daily paper, and is not bad at all. If you're ever down, you might even catch some of these stories. So why waste your time.","Judith and I have decided to follow more social media. It would make the news for news a lot more interesting. People used to have problems with using social media, but have now found that we have the ability to interact with other people and make news to share. The news industry has changed dramatically in the past decade and, as Reuters gets closer and closer, people will be able to make use of social media to do so. We have also had a huge increase in the access to the web over the past year, making it possible for the media to make more informed choices. How can this change make news even more popular? How can we use more websites to make information more accessible to people? How can more people learn about news and make informed choices? We have lots of information that we can use and have to explore. What can we do about it?","At the time of this writing, Reuters put out 3.5 million news stories. So let's see how a simple news story about one man and his family and how it has transformed our lives. If you read any newspaper, Reuters may be the biggest news site. When the news is shared on its home page, the audience is able to understand the difference between a person and someone. If someone has been on an airplane or at a bus stop, the news story can be explained in a few sentences. By avoiding as much as possible of the news story, the author makes the reader aware of the important facts and details about another person. The newspaper itself is a great source of information. In fact, Reuters does a lot of research. As we're told, a lot of people don't like reading the whole newspaper. If the news story is of an area we don't use frequently or the news spreads like a blanket, you might not have learned much. Regardless, it doesn't hurt that there are some popular newspapers.","We are literally drowning in news. Some days you get the idea of news that focuses on politics or religion and others on business or lifestyle. This is often the case in the United States. But we may not actually be hearing as much of our daily news as we used to. As the years went by, fewer and fewer articles were published and more and more news was written. People were more likely to feel insecure in their understanding of the news. For example, the news for a specific subject caused people to believe that the news remained on a different topic for a longer time. This has become a common practice among people. When this happens, we often think the news will be just one news story. But it can be really frightening. It is a big job, and even in this time of crisis, you don't want to miss an important news story.",We have become increasingly inept and addicted to news. But there is something more important and worth keeping our attention.,"Hundreds of billionaires have had their fortunes collapsed. That was a big impact on the economy of America. Now, we are literally drowning in news. When a president takes a bullet to the wall and says, ""That's all,"" the economy of America is suddenly going to crash. During the past decade, there has been an enormous rise in entrepreneurship. People are waking up every day seeking jobs and getting paid. What happened? The economy of America is losing. One way for a government to survive in a global economy, people are destroying the jobs that the government built.","While working on the day a reporter was asked why he would be going to the top of the article. The reporter, who knew exactly what was going to be on the top of the story, wanted to tell me how he can keep the story going for the remainder of his life. He knew that he was going to be a long-term contributor. The reporter began by talking about the problems the topic of the article may bring to the public and the nature of the issue. After he told his story, the reporter went for a short nap to relax. He then continued with his story. After some thought, he decided to give the story a try and find out if it was as interesting as it was liaising with the reporter. Then he ran with his own conclusion about the issue. He did not take the time to finish his story, but soon he stopped to consider his conclusions. He then went for the final segment and he decided to give the story another try. His next story might be one that may be more interesting or less interesting than what he had originally thought. He found his point when he said he was going to cover a story and ended up adding another story. He then went for a short story about an event, but then he started thinking about what happened.

B2,"Mark Adams, a film critic for The Front Page, left a publisher's journal in 1994. At one point I was asked to review a novel.

But he found his next jobs as a film critic were as much a remuneration as other job opportunities. ""It was my first job and I was really excited to get one,"" said Mark Adams.

But there was a bit of a dark storm moving through the castle and the rain started to roll in. Finally we saw a small church. Then we stopped in at Lette Cathedral, but we looked on the wall and we knew it was a lovely place. By the way, last year the weather was lovely.

Kitty is concerned that people who want to change their jobs will not be well received by the government and the government is encouraging people to do so. He is especially concerned about students who are working and who have a hard time adjusting to the changing world of job security. In addition, he wants to make a strong contribution to society. Despite the challenges of changing their jobs, the government has not bailed on the government's commitment to provide a viable employment option to those looking for work. He believes that job choice is only about the education of graduates, based on knowledge of the skills and qualifications they can improve in their chosen field.",Kitty Doherty was on a career hunt that week. After a week she found a job she couldn't take anymore! She got her job and she needed help. She asked for advice on how to be good in her job and she agreed. Now you're feeling down and stressed out and don't know how to change? Kitty shook her head and then walked down the hallway looking for tips.,"There is no more time to think about what you should do for a job if you don't want to make it an important decision in your life.

B2,"Rachel Mills was a PhD student at Southampton University. She studied sea ecology at the University of Southampton. Her research focus focuses on the ocean and the chemical processes occurring in the water. In hot water, she does research into marine geochemistry which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.","Rachel Mills is a math teacher who has taken a trip to the Atlantic Ocean. One year she came back and stayed at the hotel that the family used to stay in. At the hotel, she had to give up her job due to poor work performance. She also spent most of her time in the ocean and spent most of her time at the bottom of the ocean. Rachel was interested in studying how the tides reacted to changing water masses. She started to think it was a very slow movement and began to wonder if it was just me. Rachel Mills decided to study a different way of observing the tides. On the way home, she noticed a giant wave over the ocean. She decided to go deeper into the water. She then came across a coral reef. She then researched the coral reef's abiotic effects in order to determine what effects it may have had.","Rachel Mills is a marine scientist at Southampton University. Her favorite place to be is the oceans. But she has noticed something unusual when she was researching the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel Mills discovered a new species of sea snail, the apricot and the ocean. It was a robbery. Her research explores the effects of various factors on the seas’ water cycle. It is a scientific endeavor, and in fact, not something that can be easily explained. It is her field of study that has prompted her to become involved in research.",Rachel Mills is a chemist with a passion for the oceans. She is very knowledgeable about the many kinds of processes happening in the sea and how they happen. She is interested in the many types of processes in the marine world. Rachel is curious about the world around her and how these can affect how animals move around the water. She also observes the oceans chemical processes affecting aquatic organisms. She often takes a boat trip in the Atlantic Ocean as her studies.,"Rachel Mills studies coral molluscs which occur in the seabed and in nearby reefs. After going into the ocean, Rachel Mills observes what they find. There are many different kinds of corals and some that are very simple like algae and snails. In fact, all of the corals are molluscs. One of Rachel Mills' experiments involves measuring water in the ocean. Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean. Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the seabed. The scientific method in this is called biomimetics. Rachel Mills also trains scientists in molecular biology. She also studies the effects of water pollution and toxins on marine ecosystems. She and fellow scientist Mike Hart, a biology major, are excited to be working together.",Rachel Mills spent most of her time studying the underwater world. She is especially passionate about marine geochemistry which means she studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She wants to be the first to study the oceans. By studying the oceans she is better able to understand the many chemical processes going on in the oceans.,"Rachel Mills lives at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, where there are not many lakes. She loves the sea and takes a lot of trips. One day, her draughtsman takes her to the ocean. In a moment of silence, she is able to see the ocean from her window. She also takes a look into the local marine environment with a keen eye."
B2,"The Walled City at Kowloon was a city in Hong Kong whose king was killed. The British were unable to take possession of the city. However, the government did give it an official title as a town-hall until the 1921. The land was regarded as an open market, and the kings were not interested in it. The Chinese, who stayed in Hong Kong and built castles around the area, had little influence over the urban development of the city. The court found that the city was a town under siege from British forces. The city was then burned and renamed the Kowloon Tower. The government also offered to grant the town an official title that would eventually grant it to the King. The Queen and King of the People's Republic, who had ruled the area for years, refused to grant the city its right. The Queen also opposed granting the Tower a title with no legal basis. However, they were willing to pay the price if they had the right.","It is a pretty old city that was constructed on the banks of a river. One of the largest in Britain, Kowloon Walled City was built in 1899. Today it still sits about 40 feet high and has a wall in the rear. The first walls are either of bamboo or stone.",A group of people came up to Kowloon Walled City to see if there was anything wrong with the building. The reason was that the wall was still sunk. A tall wall over the city made it easier to cross over. The group noticed the walls made more than they looked. The group headed into the city to see how it looked like. It was a tall building.,"The walls of Kowloon Walled City were tall. As the towering buildings rose, the walls became a barrier. Hundreds of houses stood around the city. An army was deployed to protect the walls. They took to using the walls to keep the crowds moving through the building. On top of it, buildings with no walls swelled to tens of thousands. The walls and the buildings were built using a construction company. In the final analysis, the city fell victim to the British, the government of China, because it was the country that owned the city, and the people had already resisted it. In the end, the city went under British control.","The walls of Kowloon Walled City are built on a jetty. The walls look like pieces of rock that are cut off to form a wall. There are several different levels of buildings to the wall above, including small one-room buildings that were built into the wall in the early 20th century. At the top of the walls there was a street and a narrow path leading to the walls. To make matters worse, the people's republic of China was not on the property of the British. Many British people fought to keep the British out of Kowloon Walled City. It was the only British land border to be in Hong Kong so they did not have to negotiate it.","The tallest building in the city stood on a hillside with the steeple that has been built on the edge by the people at its peak. Then it rose atop the hillside, and it began to rise into the air from within. Today it is Kowloon Walled City. The city has its history from many centuries, and its buildings were erected in the 1940s. Every year, the town starts their annual remembrance day. Its first statue was placed in celebration, and a commemorative plaque was placed around the front gate. Every year the city has its own memorial, with the same building. The statue stands in the center of the city. Then the city stretches to the north and continues its annual remembrance day.","Kowloon Walled City was the first known English colony. It was an encircled city of the People's Republic of China, which was established in 1912 by the United States. The city had the first walls and the first walls were built in the late 18th Century. Standing on the top of Kowloon Walled City was the tall buildings that stood between two levels of buildings, as well as the rounded square dividing the city. The walls were much wider than the city itself, so when the emperor wanted to leave the city, he built the walls of the walls around it. When the Chinese invaded the city, they also made walls and pillars for the walls. The building were defended by the wall, and the walls of the buildings were blown apart in 1906. The construction of the wall lasted until a large military force entered the city. The colonial rulers had created large walls, but they soon fell behind them. The building had been built mainly from the construction of walls, and the walls and pillars were slopping on each other like old buildings. In 1902, it was given a government in China. The wall was built using the most advanced construction techniques, and the walls of the walls and pillars were made from bricks."
B2,"After a long trip to London, the couple decided to open their own small village. The town is located on the side of a river. I love the village, and I haven't explored it for a while. I live within the local town limits and have a nice view from here. The weather is nice and sunny, which is nice. The first thing you notice is that there is a large amount of trash, with many things being left there. There is also a lot of rubbish. So if it has a lot of rubbish then you have to pick it up if you have a lot. I always give away rubbish, so the children can have a break. But then I noticed it is not as big as the town centre is! Then suddenly a large group of people arrived and the town centre looked very pretty. The town centre is actually the small town centre. So we've tried a few different villages - this one has more variety! If there is a little bit of trash and you're looking for a place to keep your plants, you have to choose the Model Village!","From a young age you could imagine the area was used to produce food, and now it is one of the most important sites in the town! We were told this town was for farmers so we thought the village would be something of a local 'near the water'. As you enter, you can hear a strong, windy sound from the nearby stream. You feel a connection with the villagers who made this town. When you get into the village, it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land. A few short years ago we were told this town was for farmers so we thought the village would be something of a local 'near the water'. As you get into the village you can hear a strong, windy sound from the stream. As you get into the village, it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground flat and completely overgrown with brambles. After you exit the village, you can hear the sound of the stream. As you approach the village, it is hard to imagine that the stream is now under construction, as this village is in such a state of collapse that we think its worthless. As the village collapses and looks like a crumbling heap, the village is almost completely destroyed. The village is now a peaceful place with all the local people and animals eating and drinking.","You are invited to visit the model village. I wanted to show you how the village was once the largest piece of waste ground in England. I explained that I think it has been completely overgrown with brambles for years and that the village was designed by a local architect. I told you that if you look closely you can see what the village looked like. I also explained the demolition. My narrator said, that he told me that if it looks like it had been built about a decade ago the village had changed much. However, he said, that the village had changed to a more modern layout, and he added that the Village had always been very busy. He also explained that when the village was built the brambles reverted back to their original form. He said, that the village was used as a playground for children and it's the only place where the brambles were collected. He explained that the village had been an important part of the town for centuries and it was a great place. He also explained that the village was built in 1936, but the old 'Village' was destroyed as the town's population in 1856 was just under 100,000. After that time the village had grown much bigger with the advent of a small railway line and the discovery of the original footprint.",A couple of days ago you heard a radio broadcast about the Model Village. Then I had to come out of the house and see this. I was excited because the land was occupied and was completely cleared of brambles. I saw it in the park and then looked down to saunter down to the lawn. I watched it from an distance and it just began to take off. The haystack made the village look a little quaint and old. But it became an attraction as a new model village opened up. The village looked really good.,"There is a lot of greenery in the Village at the moment but there are also many small birds and birds that don't live in the Village. It is difficult to see if the village is a place worth any money. The village itself has nothing in common with the town, but the land is fairly large and the town isn't very hospitable to birds. The Village has a small pool but you have to take your own equipment and use the space to eat your catch.","The Model Village is the place to go to live, and have a good time. Since they don't have a car, they have to drive a few hours to the place. The town hall and offices are the usual spots, but the community stretches almost to every town square. The village includes the town hall, playground, and many other places to play, a library, playground, car park, a coffee shop, a cafe, the coffee shop, the local coffee shop, some restaurants, a shop, an art gallery and an auto shop. The village's main attractions are the playground, the park, and the car park. To enter the Village, enter by entering the main entrance gate. The Village House has a brick-burning fire, a small pond, and benches. The village is open to the public from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday except on weekends and holidays.","To the Village's residents, the town's land and buildings are often considered surplus land. But the village's first steps are often a bit daunting. A few short years ago, the village was turned into a waste dump by the owners and a waste landfill. Today, the site has a variety of uses, including as a recycling facility and industrial town hall. The local government has started to consider the village as a good place to live and work. The Village's first major development is modern housing. It features a large house, two buildings, a two-story brick and concrete block house, a modern kitchen, and a three-storey barn. Its exterior is reminiscent of a medieval ruined house. The village has a few buildings that are not listed on the National Heritage List, including a barn, and some of the village's buildings. The village and its residents live in the main building. It has a beautiful asian dining hall, with some lovely windows. However, the village has recently been sold by the owners as a junkyard, and the current owners want to make it into a permanent home. However, the town's economy is poor and people living on the ground do not want to return to the past. So, the Village is now a popular site for residents and visitors alike."

Upon entering, there were three families who were told that they must take a tour before they decide whether to have a go. One of those families, the Burns, said the theme on the site was ""not very impressive"". That leaves another.","Fun Island is a huge theme park for children. Children love going there and having a blast. But it's sometimes more expensive than other theme parks, and there is always a line. Here are five things to do and where to park:","My mum decided to make a trip to the US. I wanted to be as memorable as possible for my son.

The first thing we see is the show's sound track. It is constantly changing and you can sometimes hear how people are reacting to it. Then we are introduced to the producers. That first is the first question to make us see what they're doing. We're asked some trivia questions about what's going on and the next is the final question. Usually we don't think we have heard as much about it as we would have. But these are the questions we're given at the end of a film. The producers want us to know if they're promoting a drama, a documentary or something else. The audience is made up of people from everyone's homes, businesses and communities. We don't know who they are - it's often a mystery how they're in this place. The answer is the studio audience.",A few weeks ago Cosmo Landesman saw what it was like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made. She found out it's just another common feature of television life. Like technical difficulties studio audiences are just another common feature of television life. We've all seen this a lot. But since they are still a mystery to many of us they remain a mystery.,"People in studio audiences have their own experience of watching shows. Some of us will become familiar with studio audiences through a series of visual screens or the audio of music. Despite the difficulties the studio audience is experiencing, a lot of people still seem excited about seeing a series of television shows. Throughout the series of theatre dramas and film, people get to interact with the production team that are doing the production. The voice of the production team is constantly changing. The studio audiences are also often a challenge to watch on television. During a show, you have to find out what is going on at the screen. You hear that the studio audience is watching a small part of a musical piece playing a very specific character. Many studio audiences have a small audience at any one time in the production of the series. What has happened to the audience as it looks? How will some viewers react?

B2,"Mike Rutherford is at the GM Motoring Show in London for the first time. He has been taking his latest models of vehicles around the UK and Europe. He's driven around the US a lot but still is not sure about their latest models. The EN-V concept seems more fun to take a ride on. It's a bit of a problem for me, since it's a two-wheeled vehicles. But we're able to afford it.","At the Australian Motor Show, the NASCAR Cup Series took place in a narrow city. The race was organized in two segments--riding, driving, and rowing. At each segment of the race there were ten standing tyres. When judging these tyres, we discovered that these tyres were built for a specific purpose. Which meant that the NASCAR Cup Series were intended for the NASCAR Grand Prix and racing cars. The two segments were divided into different classes. The cars were made to accommodate the tyres of different car brands--for example, the NASCAR Grand Prix lasted for 10 laps. This was an opportunity for NASCAR to be a part of the NASCAR Grand Prix racing circuit. The NASCAR Grand Prix lasted for 10 laps. The four wheeled cars featured in the NASCAR Grand Prix race went nowhere. The NASCAR race was planned for August in San Francisco. We were excited to see what would be available in 2017. Among these was a prototype called the GM EN-V. In fact, the EN-V's design is the best-looking two-wheeled road car ever produced. The race was sponsored by GM. The NASCAR Grand Prix series has now been inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame. This year, it's a competition to see who can drive the most advanced cars in the world, especially cars that can travel on one tyre. The winner will win $250.","The EN-V concept, which was given its title as Europe's smartest one, is a clever way to transport the world to Europe's cities by air and trains. The introduction of the new concept puts the two-wheeled version on the fast track. Several people have been test-riding the concept of urban transport to be tested at a local motoring fair, in which GM's new version will soon be unveiled. I drive the concept a couple of times a week, but the first test run was a test run on a new En-V. The EN-V has a unique, three-wheeled axle designed to match the car's interior, with the four wheels folded into the axle. The car can be driven both ways. My trip to the fair was very different. The EN-V is a two-wheeled-two-seater solution to urban transport. The two wheels are folded into a frame, which is the wheelbase. The body of the EN-V features a wide-axle aluminum chassis with a round rear-deck. The upper-deck features a twin-engine engine that gives its driver and passenger an air-lift option. Each wheel has its own air-lift option which means the driver can control the weight of the car from an eight-speed manual. Both models use an on-board air-lift system with the wheels folded into a circular plane-like frame. The EN-V also features a wide range of attachments including telescopic air-conditioners which allow people to transport the car as needed. A neo-Rafael cab can be added to the EN-V in an optional package to help provide a safer transport system.","With so many cars in the market today, how can I find a vehicle that goes around the city? For me, the EN-V is a great idea. Since it uses two wheels, it's almost an emergency car. The interior design of the two seats is similar to the one in a two-wheeler. As a matter of fact, the interior design seems to make for a very interesting view of the city. But this isn't the first time it's been deemed attractive by drivers. The first GE EN-Vs were based on the GM Transport Vehicle, which is a two-wheeled roadcar. The first model featured an optional one-wheel option, which allows you to change seats. The second model, which was built for a larger city, has a single wheel option. All in all, the EN-V has a sleek design that looks even better on road.","An EN-V is a two-wheeled, two-seater and two-wheeled two-seater. The concept is a two-wheeled, two-seater idea. One of the advantages of the concept is that the engine can convert the two-wheeled bus which is a three-speed system into a four-wheeler. The design could be made using a single engine. It is likely that most people will be familiar with the GM concept when they get the chance. It could be a very exciting and efficient transport solution, with the same design and a lot of promise. However, I'm very disappointed by the design. As for the practical aspects of the concept, it's very easy to learn. For one thing, the four wheels in a EN-V are designed to rotate forward through the air. What's even more interesting is that the two wheel layout is built from two axles. It has a special design that makes it easier to take the two wheels and the seats in the cars in one direction. The two-wheel concept allows the car to accelerate and to pass around quickly at high speed. The concept was not a new invention. We haven't seen the concept for a while and we are just pleased.","Mike Rutherford, owner of this small car on the outskirts of Glasgow, grew up riding cars. He was inspired by the new vehicles he was looking at. He bought the EN-V which has a body, a steering rack, and an air intake, and the AC unit isn't equipped with gas. The EN-V has an external battery and is charged by an EE. The EN-V is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport. It is built with a very clever design and the engine was built in a very quiet factory to a fairly large budget. The EN-V was built in North America but isn't expected to reopen until late 2006. The small EN-V is a very good and a small size for city use.","It's the first car ever created by GM. What's more, in addition to the technology and design expertise, it provides a practical, reliable alternative to the two-wheel-driven (and sometimes single-wheel-controlled) single-seater. And so I have a new companion to the En-V! Last week I drove an EN-V and it's a bit like flying a small plane than driving."
B2,"I used to travel to the south of France once and still do, as many people do. But lately it's been a great road trip, where you can travel on the train or on foot. I have been riding the train since I was 5 years old and the service is the best I have ever had. The main stipulation is that the car must have a diesel fuel pump or a diesel power horn. The driver screams to the driver but gets into a squibby car and rides away. It's a lovely sight to see, but I can't do that without the smell of trains on the tracks. There are beautiful train tracks. The French government has given the train passengers the option of switching tracks when they are out of town. It will cost you £220 to change it and it's a lovely sight.","Two years ago, I flew in and spent four years touring France on the European Union, with my parents. As the journey continued I was blown away with the memories of my journey. I have many memories I still cherish, and always look for them. On the other side, the railway has become a popular sight in many cultures, and I've come across many of the same images. I'm pleased that there's a local train from Cannes to the south of France, which passes through the country and makes it to the railway station. The railway isn't far behind and the train isn't quite the best option for tourists. A photo of the train's journey, taken from a book.","Andrew Morgan was on a trip to the south of France. He was visiting a farm where he bought a tractor and a tractor. He said: ""There was a lot of traffic. That was just the beginning."" He stopped at an old tea house when the train approached. I asked him what he had seen the most. It was dark and then he said he saw a train. He asked me to take pictures. This is when I began to feel close to the landscape. Then he said: ""It just wasn't that bad."" I started to think about where I would like to take photos and it was amazing! It was like having a vacation and I would go over the same parts of the world. It's beautiful in the zoo. The train was running at about 8 o'clock, I'm sure you could tell by the photos that this is a very pleasant train ride.","Some people can go from Louvre to Berlin and get lost along the rails. But many people have forgotten about this journey. The train takes you from Berlin to Rome via Paris and Rome to Barcelona via Munich. It's not exactly the same experience as Rome. But sometimes people forget about it despite this wonderful history. The first line to Paris starts from Barcelona and then travels up to Paris, through Rome via the Venetian city of Milan, and then back to Rome via Bucharest. This is a unique experience for everyone - both the most ardent and casual. On the second line, they get to Rome through Paris via a canal. They see the Venetian city from afar, so the bus takes them to Rome, the only train to the train station. They think they'll arrive at the Musée d'Hieur des Alpes (which has some fascinating ruins) before they make their way back to Paris via the Gare du Nord. The train is still in service at the time.","A train journey has turned to a more romantic journey in this famous region. One ten-year-old boy, Andrew, was in Europe on a train vacation, and we decided to ride the train every time we got to see him. As we went to look at the images on the board, it dawned on us that many people had enjoyed their travellings. And that he had forgotten how much the train was costing, and we decided to give it a try. Now our favorite moments on the train include a scenic tour of the countryside, eating out at local restaurants and chatting to people around us.","Andrew Morgan is a journalist, a reporter from the Channel 4 station, which has a small train station in the centre of town. He often takes photos, reads and writes travel blogs on his phone and his family's e-mail. As a reporter, he has seen the beauty and variety of the world's most glamorous stars and famous landmarks. He is a keen outdoorsman who uses his skill to help others find the perfect spots to get lost. He's been to the centre of town twice a week and has been to the centre of town three times during the last seven years, to visit friends and family. Mr Morgan enjoys visiting landmarks and taking pictures and watching local bands play, but has also tried to learn about local food.","The train from Cannes is coming down this weekend if you're interested in seeing an alternative to train travel. It is being delayed because it isn't going to be on a permanent schedule. One of the passengers is a young woman who loves France, while the other has her family in England. She is excited to see what is on offer from the station at Parc du Fer. It is in the main train station, behind Notre Dame Cathedral. Despite its lackluster view of Paris, it still makes for great photographs - including an image from Notre Dame. The train will soon be boarding a train from Venice to Amsterdam which is just outside Lisbon. Guests will need to do an extensive search for the route - and some passengers will need a car. In a photo taken at the French-Canadian railway crossing last weekend, some travellers saw the cab driver taking a break from travelling. The cab driver, however, refused to return to the station. The other passengers were able to watch the train travel through Paris, but they didn't mind the delay, which they had previously missed by a few seconds. If I go for the train, I'll be back on that route. It will be a short distance, so expect a lengthy and sometimes stressful journey."
B2,"We are all in the middle of a race to find a suitable home for our children. One day we are trying to find a room in our room and we hear that someone is sleeping there.

The next section deals with the future.","This is the story of Alan Weisman. Weisman wrote this book to help explain how humankind's mark on Earth would disappear as the weather starts to get cooler. Weisman analyzes how long it would take for humans' mark on Earth to disappear. The book takes place in the fictional New York City area of New York City. The New York City area will be affected by many factors in its own right: The population, people in the city and the climate. Alan Weisman's book explores how humankind's mark on Earth might change if it suddenly disappears. A few of the factors that effect the New York City area include the land's melting of glaciers, flooding of Antarctica, and the climate. Weisman gives an interesting description of how humankind would affect our planet if it suddenly disappears. A recent study by Weisman shows that humankind has a relatively large role in our environment. Weisman's book describes the environment and the impact it would have on the population. He also describes the effect that the climate could have on the climate.",Alan Weisman has written a book about human nature. The books discuss how one year it would take humankind to disappear on Earth. How the world would grow without humans? It would become more polluted by a more acidic environment. The Earth would be much drier if humans disappeared than would be without humans.,"The world's quickest moving infected species inhabited Earth for millions of years. With the advent of the Internet, humans could travel from place to place without a trace. In a space station, they tracked the Earth's orbit and discovered that the nebulas could not migrate from the same place to another. As the universe rotated, the nebulas would migrate, moving toward Earth on their way through the atmosphere. The nebulas were the oldest living inhabitants of the earth in 3600 years. While they were on earth, they disappeared. What would happen to our planet and its inhabitants if they disappeared?","Weisman uses a method that takes years and millions of dollars to build. Weisman does not give any details, including time, but tells how to build the system. Weisman explains how it would happen. He presents four dimensions of the system. His explanation has one main theme: we would need a new civilization to take control of the earth. The question is about how the system will evolve. Weisman's book says that humanity would create more people if it could. This concept also discusses how we can protect the environment if we are to protect it. Weisman asks, in one chapter, how it would happen to New York if humankind were to disappear. So, the human population is not going to be able to survive. The problem is that we will need to make more people, not fewer people. Weisman says that human civilizations require new humans to develop. Weisman lays out a timeline of the human population, where and how humanity can survive. This timeline is based on an experiment conducted by Weisman in the field of energy conservation. The experiment has six weeks of work and there are 7 days of work. Weisman concludes that we will need to make more and more people, then only we would survive if we were to have fewer people. This will make us less of a threat to the environment, but it will still work.","Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us examines the role that humans played in the world. He writes the book by using a series of images, which illustrate how the planet's human past would change in the future. The images show how humans came to live mainly from their human pasts. The human past shows us how the human condition changes over the years. This is a scientific theory of the long-term effects of human life. Alan Weisman's new book The World Without Us takes a look at how humankind's mark on Earth would disappear over time. Throughout the book there are eight different stories that show how human beings live as organisms. The book includes three stories in the series. The most popular is The World Without Us, where we learn about how the human race has changed over time and why it is important to maintain life. The world without humans is a great book to read as a study.","Alan Weisman published The World Without Us in 2006. To prove his theory of the human nature, we published The World Without Us, published in 1999. It examined time lapses, such as the time in the sky when stars appeared above Manhattan. Weisman concludes that it would take a minimum of 66 years for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear after humans were first introduced in humans. He also outlines how New York is likely to survive if humankind continues to exist."

It was the year when the storms began a new season and we finally decided we needed to come out of our valley. I was glad when I found out the hills were getting less and less developed because it was really winter. It began like a dream. We realized how easy it was to be alive.,"It was winter, and we lived in the valley until they reached the middle of June. There were so many snowstorms that this year we had to evacuate. But the rain came early. The weather forecasts were awful so I decided to take my spring break so we could escape a bit and have some relaxation. I was able to resolutely ignore the winter storms, which seemed like a way to escape the snowy, summery days of spring. It was the best year of our life.",The mountain range in our valley had been robbed by the winter storms. The snow fell on us and spoiled our crops. We feared we would be caught up in the cold with those snow-laden blizzards.

We had been told there might be storms coming from a different side of town. So we went with a group to attend and decided to make the most of the occasion and get the most people. We were prepared to do something and have a great party but we really wanted the crowd to be not too afraid of us. The town prepared for us and we felt worried and worried. We had a lot of food but we didn't have much to make. So we decided to make the most of the weather. We started with an acoustic group of people singing loudly and holding their instruments. When the rain began, the crowd started screaming in the air. The thunder and lightning started to spread and the children had to be at their most enraged. Finally we took a lot of pictures of the weather and realized there was no rain in the valley. This was the day the storms came early before the calendar even hinted at winter even before November was out.","This is the story of a mother and her son living in the valley. They lived on an isolated farm near the mountains near their home. Their village has an underground water supply. They are aware of the dangers they face when their neighbors, their friends and even their animals leave. They're aware of the threats they can cause, but cannot predict the damage they'll suffer. The town's government has developed an emergency plan which the townspeople had to meet in order to prevent the dangers from spreading. In the past, people have lived on the verge of a catastrophic weather event. The only way they can protect themselves is to go outside. They have found shelter in the valley through natural storms. It is extremely dangerous to live in the valley and there are so many dangers for the people of the valley."
B2,"Miss Rita Cohen looked twice the age of Seymour's daughter Marie so she admired Marie and said she looked six years older than Marie. Since Marie was more of a pale-skinned girl, a woman named Rita Cohen approached Seymour a couple of days ago. She had a long, thin hair. She started a conversation with him and his secretary. She said that she loved him. So on Valentine's Day, Rita Cohen was dressed up as Marie. He put her underwear and told her that she was Marie. She was stunned and said, 'She looks really pretty.'","In her early 20s, a little girl got dragged into a group of girls. She had little hair but didn't have a lot of freckles. She was covered in makeup and wore shorts. She hung out by the sofa. She looked smaller and blonder then Seymour. She looked like she had a younger sister. The naysayers thought she was a little too young for her age but he didn't think so. Eventually, she looked less like he did.","Seymour's mother Marie was a great grandmother, so Rita came home to the girls that day. The family had the good fortune to have their own daughter to look after. Rita was so kind to the other girls and even helped out their little siblings. Her parents had a good family life, but her mom knew little of Rita's life. She never really cared. At school Rita was going to be a teacher in the school of mathematics. But she still cared. So Rita took her little sister to see what she wanted to learn. As Rita looked at Rita's face, her grandma said, ""I can't really describe how happy I was. Rita's life was not very meaningful.""","Miss Rita Cohen was half the age of Seymour's daughter Marie. He loved her and felt like he was getting a little closer. When she was little, she was pretty, but as she got older, she looked like she was in generals. Her mom was embarrassed, so he gave her up. She wasn't even allowed to have a picture. He decided not to tell her about Rita or her life. The girl said she was half the age of Marie. She looked like she was six years younger. Seymour is an older man so he has a lot of influence. When she's old enough to be famous, they give him a hug. He asks her to get out of the shoes. Her mom then goes to bed.","Seymour wanted to find a good girl to help him with his housework and his children's homework. He did well finding Rita, but she had been a good girl so she hid her age and started trying to look like Marie. Rita wore overalls and wore a jacket and a blouse. This was enough to give Rita, and she made her life pretty quick after her stumbling upon her age.","Miss Rita Cohen was a petite dandy who looked half the size of Marie, but seemed a little too tall to make a fuss. She was dressed in overalls and long hair but was barefoot in shorts. But her paleness made her look more pliable and beautiful, and she was wearing full outfits. The hair was short and she was going to get very bored. Then she was wearing very sexy asian hair dresses, and even a short skirt, and looking somewhat older then snooty. Seymour noticed that Rita was too pale and unattractive, and went home. Her hair was still long, but she was too blonde and blond to be noticeable. She wore an old pair of lilac sandals and blue and black sandals. She awoke one morning to find Marie wearing overalls. She told Seymour she knew exactly how to be her mother when Seymour came home to give her a birthday wish. She was very happy to find Marie and was happy to see him bsit a few more years later.","In 1880, Seymour made the acquaintance of a small girl in Paris named Rita.

They were lovely and classy, but with the right dress she was sure to be a winner. Ned Ingham, who has a Bachelor of Arts in fashion from Cambridge, has also studied painting. 'It doesn't really matter what type of dress I try on at my wedding, what I look for in my wedding dress. It goes in favour of a simpler and less 'fridly' look' and'more graceful dresses' are the most popular. A designer from London, he developed a unique dress in the UK, to share with everyone. 'I think a dress is timeless, timeless and so comfortable. '","Ned Ingham is the head of sales at a small clothing shop in London, and has been designing dresses since the age of four. He specialises in silk dresses and is now working for a label named The Designers. A few months ago, he helped an editor create a piece of paper to dispense his new dresses, and was delighted to discover that it worked. He has since started offering wedding dresses online and he is hoping to use the site to build his brand. He hopes this year's fashion sales will be as strong as it was the year before. With his clothes, accessories and jewelry being branded, he has produced elegant dresses and suits for a wedding and other functions. This year's Fashion Week showcased his latest creation, an upscale wedding dress and skirt. The look is similar to that worn in the 1960s, but with a slightly more modern twist.

The dress was made by Ned and in a simple style, 'for bridesmaids and godmothers'.","The styles we have become familiar with from the 80s are a mixture of modern and classic. It is time to change things a little for the better. 'Frilly' dresses are a common place-of-wear in a wedding. 'Boys and women alike, if you are looking for a romantic or casual look, go for a simple 'frilly' dress instead of the 'frilly' type. Dress designers also take inspiration from contemporary styles and modern trends. We are often seen in fashion magazines such as Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar.

B2,"A musical talent is a gifted child who needs a musical training. Especially gifted kids need to develop musical abilities before they can become independent. However, there is an underlying problem if there is only a a short amount of time. It is difficult to develop a music gifted child. It's hard to see if it will come from them but will eventually be from them when there is no time. Sometimes children need support or to get advice about how best to develop their musical talent. It's not easy to overcome this problem. It's also not always easy to understand their ability. It is easier to see if they can find their musical talent, and try to develop their ability. The best way to tackle this problem is to offer them encouragement. Sometimes they simply do not want to be around the music. However, they feel guilty or unhappy when they feel that the music is unattractive and do not help them develop their music skills. You should try to offer the child a positive outlet to encourage his or her musical ability and develop it and continue to perform.","A gifted child is often called a'muse'. However, often there is an absence of a gift. Sometimes it's simply a lack of enthusiasm or a lack of understanding. For example, when a young child is talented with a musical instrument, they are very reluctant to play it. This is called 'honourable' music. Parents often try to make the musical gift their children receive, but can often be difficult to maintain. However, the teacher is also concerned about the child's development. When a child is talented and gives the teacher permission to use it, they get annoyed and discouraged. Although you can always change an instruction for the child, it's usually best to listen with a sense of what the child is learning. Children who develop musical skills can be a great teacher or teacher. As a teacher, your child has the opportunity to try new things and you are working to help them achieve their goals. The teacher has to be careful and listen to what her child is learning to achieve. In general, a child who has developed musical skills is very interested in learning music. Parents should be prepared for this and offer feedback when they give it the attention it needs. If the child is interested in learning to play music, the teacher may be happy to help them.","The kids often forget about their musical talents so they start to develop musical talents by themselves. This has been the theme of a few events in my neighbourhood on which I'm involved. This is my children's musical recital. The recital is a celebration of new musical talent, like their ability to play drums, and in a special way to help them learn about and share their musical talents, or their artistic talent. The children enjoy playing with their songs, and there is a great deal of fun going out on their own. Their music skills come in handy every year, and you're not the only one who is concerned with them. Sometimes the children also come to my neighbourhood with their own musical talents to express their creativity and desire.","The music teacher has a son who is learning a new instrument. She's worried she'll lose her interest and encourage her children to learn to play their favorite instruments. She's concerned her child won't learn from them. At school, she's busy learning the new music and she has to sit in a class for the whole week at a time. She shows her son about the new music and says ""as soon as you start the piano, I'm going to get you!"". She takes her son through the piano part of the lesson and when she finishes, she's angry that she can't teach her son to play music.","Their musical talent is displayed through their musical talent. But most musicians have a musical talent in their imagination. These kinds of talent often don't come in their repertoires - they are too familiar to anyone's taste and they often have to find a way to bring them up. Children's gifts will often come in different varieties. In some areas, such as music school, their parents cannot develop their musical talent because of the lack of funds, so they go through extensive training. Sometimes even the teacher of an exceptional musician will take charge of their child's learning and it can be hard to see how much they have learned. Often their music talent is hidden from the rest of the family. Then there are musical talents in other areas. It can be difficult to get your child into school but they can't be overlooked. This is why we should listen to other parents and encourage the talent they are capable of producing.","When my daughter was younger, my sister had a piano and played it all the time. I stepped in and told her to have a friend play it for her. My sister loved it and asked me to play it with her. Our teacher said she enjoyed it. I said yes, she is a great help. Then I was told her the music is great.","By the time they had their own talent and started singing to their own level, many people didn't know how to care for them. While teaching English, a talented musician had taken over his family's business and he found his own business too. At one point, his mother was frustrated he had to go out on the street and sell the guitar. When a friend of his took over his music business, he offered him a few hours to be a part of the operation. Instead, he bought a guitar and went on to start a new career. So, he grew to appreciate his gift. Then, they had some difficulty finding anyone who could make music or would be able to lend them a hand. It took months until they found people who could afford a good guitar. Those who had already been at the service had no choice but to take over the operation. This is what got him frustrated. I had to find someone to help him learn how to practice and how to make money so that he could go out on the street and buy some guitars for his business."

I'm thrilled that you've picked me up and I can get back to you as soon as it arrives!","To me, the word 'letter' has nothing to do with words, and it just makes me smile. I have heard of mailman letters that were given to him. They were written in the style of a letter. When people wanted to hear it and open them up, it sounded like a good sign. Today, the old-fashioned letter writing has been replaced by technology and computers. Fortunately, there are things that make letter writing more interesting. Firstly, it saves the writing. Second, letters come from different places. The writer writes in letters and faxes, where they are intended to look up the same material across many different fields. Third, letters come from different kinds of people, all types of people. Various types of people include individuals who are friends, teachers, or acquaintances. The writer likes to give his/her opinion of a person as the way he expresses or describes the subject.","I went to college a few years ago and fell in love with a letter.

We then started our correspondence, which included an introduction of the teacher, a question from the student about the experience, a greeting for the teacher. I cried and cried throughout the process. The letter was delivered to a student and he was very excited about it. I wrote it on his Kindle and it was a great sign for him.

The teacher asked me to find the correct words to put in each letter! When I finally found the correct words, I knew that it was all perfect! I thought it would be so fun! When I got home I called the library to get a look at some of the papers I had been doing. This is a good sign! I got to work! I really enjoy writing. I hope it does not disappear forever!

Julie, however, still has the advantage of being able to write the letter she sent. Julie feels that she can be trusted to write properly and has an understanding of how letters work.

Eventually I found myself struggling. We resorted to what was best for me. Each person who tried a different thing made it easier and easier to make a difference to what people were interested in the things they did. Our three friends - one for each person - tried everything at their disposal. We made everyone happy. They didn't have a single thing they had in common.

The tests have been so successful that for the last four years, it has been on her CV. It has taken her a while to write the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. As I write the first biography, we go to meetings with the people who were so impressed with Dorothy's achievements. I try to be there. As my research is going on, I become very close to Dorothy.","The famous British Nobel Prize winner Dorothy Hodgkin (Joseph Kennedy) was born in 1934. Dorothy Hodgkin studied in England at Cornell. She won the Nobel Prize in 1954. While studying, she discovered an ancient Greek manuscript, and later began writing her famous biography. She won the Nobel Prize in 1967 and was awarded a gold medal for literature. The prize is given by the Australian Government to women scientists. During the writing process, she goes on to study about the life and work of the Nobel laureate. Her research has made it clear that women have the most important role in preserving our planet's natural ecosystems. She is well-known in her homeland for her scientific work and is an important advocate of natural and social diversity in Australia, namely conservation and sustainability.","The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize has been an English female. She has been a British-born female since 1936, and won it with a record-breaking 73 medals. To date she has won the Nobel Prize 493 times. I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test, which gives my friends and acquaintances a chance to learn about what I'm writing about. The test gives you a wide range of information including: the cause of ovarian tumors, how well she researched her mother's disease, the effects of cancer, the cause of ovulation, how many patients she treated and the cause of death. I have a personal belief that the result of the test will change the lives of those who are affected, which is a big part of the research process. We will discuss this during this passage.

We get to the test room to have a conversation, then we are asked if we would be surprised to hear her speaking to the media or if she is giving a speech on the subject of Dorothy Hodgkin. We are all amazed at the level of accuracy that our test subjects are given. The test consists of questions for each personality trait, and a personality test for each personality. We are asked to fill in the gaps between what Dorothy Hodgkin said and what I am going to write. Aside from that I am also asked for a personal note in a notebook, to see what the question the writer is answering is about. I am the smallest person in the room. Dorothy Hodgkin told us that if we had a broader view of what a bumbling scientist would be like, she wouldn't be a doctor. We don't know the subject, Dorothy Hodgkin, for example. The test tests children and adults to see what their basic understanding of the subject is. We are all surprised. I ask them what they are reading. They give a strong answer. When asked, why do they give such a broad answer? I think Dorothy is a great person and I am thrilled.","As a scientist, Dorothy Hodgkin is in a medical college.

I was happy to be back home now because my time in the car was going to be so good.,I planted my stake in New Zealand in May this summer. I went through such a difficult season that I had to put away much of my sage in the last few months. On my final day in the world I felt more like an old man and more like a person.

We use them for building structures and play ground games. I don’t plan to be a teacher but I hope to have a place to live with them as soon as I grow up. I love being outdoors. I live in New Zealand and grew up on a farm. It is a warm place and I think we enjoy the outdoors so much more.,"I planted my stake in New Zealand. I had already begun to enjoy it for two or three years. It seems that the trees didn’t just stay there. But the trees looked so beautiful at last year’s wedding. I planted my stake in New Zealand and the whole weather was great! Jonallum Porritt argues in an interview on “Seeing Green – The Politics ofEcology”. In it, Porritt discusses how trees can contribute to the change of a landscape, what a change in climate means and the influence that the changing climate has on native plants. Jonallum Porritt will talk to Donni about her book Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology.",When I was very young I was always in a hot sweat. I wouldn’t go in if I was too tired. Then it became so hot I could’t go outside. I decided to put on a big jacket that I could have warm jeans. Then when I got home I made a decision to go indoors but not outside. I took off the hat and made a big blanket. I then took off the sweater and made a large blanket for myself. With the trees I planted my stake in New Zealand. Jonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'. I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn’t have any summers. With the trees I planted my stake in New Zealand I now understand the fact that in recent years I haven’t had any summers.

James's innocence hides a complex and brilliant imagination. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase.","Barbara Michaels, a senior woman in the forensics department of the state of Maine, begins visiting a school newspaper. She scours through the newspapers, looking for an article about a recent investigation. One of the articles contains a description of what happened that night. By the time she arrived to the campus, she gathered several of her students and their assistants, including Detective Inspector James. In her interview, Miss Michaels says that despite her age, she had not had much time to think about things. She tells her students and assistants she would like more time to talk. She reveals that she did not have enough time to write a book. She takes more time to write, because she really enjoyed reading it. She focuses on the crimes she wants to expose and develop detective stories. As she works on the case, Phyllis Dorothy, one of her professors, encourages her students and their professors to come to her school and share their research findings. They are interested in the similarities between the two authors. Phyllis is a popular writer, despite being an independent individual. However, her story goes on for too long as she believes the reader can't see past the mystery and the information being presented. This allows the reader to understand her story at her most innocent.

James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase. Aside from the dramatic flutter, P.D.

He said he was interested in me and wanted to know the name. He said he was coming to New York. He talked to the guy about a couple of things. He didn't talk to the guy about anything.

He was very friendly and had some really good advice about money. He was very understanding of my fears and expressed some of his opinions. When we arrived at the room, he told us about a job for him in the store. His interest in giving me something to buy and asking me if I would be doing anything helped our situation. He seemed pleased and didn't want to change anything. He said that the store's manager would pay him in case he couldn't buy something he wanted or anything at all.

C1,"We opened the farm last year and we were trying to run our dairy farm down into the countryside. The dairy farm was on the brink of collapse and now we have to find somewhere else for our animals. We’ve reclaimed some land and re-planted it. In the meantime, we still find other animals that need to stay warm and dry and a new place to feed them. Now that we are living, the animals that live there are all being raised. Now we must look after those orphaned.","After my husband Derek’s new business grew out of an inherited dairy farm, we decided to sell it so we could resell the land. I thought I had to stop thinking, so we took a step back and looked around, thinking: What do we do now? I looked at a box full of boxes and poured the juice out of it. I said, what now? What now? Then there was a cardboard box poured out of the box that was filled to the top, which was filled to the bottom, and the bottom. So it was all packed and was ready to be shipped.","I first heard of the opening of an organic farm. We thought it would be a great idea and so we gave up the old mill to do something new. So, two years ago, we decided to open the new mill in Somerset. We began by turning a dairy farm into a ‘open farm’ so we could have an open farm. One night my helper grabbed a box that she had pulled from a sack and opened it. I ate them and it was packed, but I don’t remember having to look at it or take it down. My helper started telling me what would be in the new mill. Now I don’t have a job. Instead, I have the pleasure of looking after an orphaned animal. So, for my job, I asked my helper about the new mill. The helper said that if the barn isn’t used, then I can find a suitable new barn. So, it started with the old mill and ended up being an open farmhouse. My helper let me look at the new barn with the helper’s eyes. The helper gave us a plastic milk bottle and we filled the box about halfway. So, I opened it up for the day and opened the fridge. It had a fresh milk bottle and a plastic bucket. My helper took this container of milk and put it into the box. As soon as I opened it, the helper opened it, and sealed it with a lid.","The dairy farm in Somerset had a ‘open farm’ ethos to look after the orphaned animals. With a lot of work going on outside in the rain this year the animals have been kept in a dark room. Our animals have been born into the farm animals, so it seems that they are well received. My partner was hoping that the babies would take an advantage of their time to get away from the winter snow and have a rest and sleep. The babies got ready for their birth. At first they are in fear for the other animals’ safety. However, after the babies’ first day of life, their mum made them feel pretty much happy about it. At first they thought that we would see them grow quickly and they would learn the difference. Eventually we started to get on with them, making sure their welfare is followed, and raising them up. We’ve already started receiving applications for veterinary workers and veterinary students to look after these animals. We’ve decided to turn our farm into a 'open farm’ for the orphaned animals. Our animals have been living in a cold room for more than 18 months now. Until recently they’re at our stables so we can watch them from the window.","Derek came into our farm last year and brought us a zoo. She wanted to feed the animal she was caring for. He saw a cute cat with green eyes. The two decided to get involved and have fun. Suddenly the cat stopped talking and walked off into the countryside. Derek asked his helpers to stop it and said they could keep the animals on. The cat was in the sun. Derek’s helpers are the only ones here and are always looking after the animals. The animals are spoiled. They also have to be cared for. Our farms often don’t have animals at all. The cats are confined to the barns and have to be kept locked or not seen for long. After their keeper got rid of the animals, they took their cue from me.","On Friday morning, my husband's son, Derek, came home from work and said he would pick up the box of orphaned animals. We rushed across the street, but a raccoon was spotted outside. We knew it was a possum or a tin jackrabbit. He was terrified of mice and was intrigued by what was happening to him. He began walking away. I wondered where things were when one of my helpers stopped in for a chat. I knew what seemed to be a box of orphaned animals. My helper was shocked to see this. I was trying to decide if this was a good idea. I looked around and found that it was a pooper box. My helper didn't know what to do, but I went ahead and asked his helpers. I took the box home, grabbed the tin jackrabbit and headed home. I asked someone to go along and see if they could give it to me, but my helper couldn't say how to do it. I took the jackrabbit home again, but nothing happened. This morning I was ready to make it back home, but my helper was too busy to ask. Then a raccoon walked by the barn to ask for help. I watched him run, looking suspiciously around for answers and eventually into the barn. As they approached, someone approached and knocked on my door. My helper screamed, ‘What now?’ I did so and returned to our farm. In reality, it was a box that looked to have been thrown into a haystack. So it was my aider who pulled the box back out. My helper said it would be a good idea to bring some medicine with it, but I was too lazy to do so. This was the first of many times I tried to use the jar to eat things but could only do so much when no one else had seen it. I took a little of my time thinking about how to feed it, and how to eat it. I did so...in one night I started to think what had to do with the jar, if the box was inside....and what to do about it.",BRINGING UP BADGERS – Our farm now has an open space where people can pick up orphaned animals. The farm has been turned into an ‘open farm’ with an ‘open farm’ menu – each child tastes something unique – and a farmer who cares about animals in this way will be happy to help re-sell orphan animals.

C1,"Publisher A, called the Guardian, reports that an initial analysis of a book by a leading publisher was a failure on marketing. However, the review of a book's commercial success was not the only determining factor for a book's commercial success. Publisher B, about the influence of the reviews of a book's commercial success, compares the marketing effect to another one. The review of a book shows how the same thing may be influenced by the same product. The book's commercial success is measured through the amount of copies sold.","The review of a book is an invaluable tool in determining the success of a publisher. Some books are bestsellers, others are considered very exciting. As the quality of the books influenced it, publishers should focus more on the reviews. When publishers write a book, their readers are usually very interested in the characters and the story. But because their audience can easily be influenced, their sales usually drop.","The British publisher who sold The Harry Potter series wrote, in 1923, about the effects of the reviews they got. It was one of the things that caused them a surge in sales, so we asked five of them. When you put together a collection, it is usually easy to judge which will have the most money in the world. These days, almost all the writers and directors are writing to earn money.",A newspaper article said that there are four books a year that have won awards for the best writing. These books come out every year. A new review about a book on the New Year's day was posted on their website on Thursday and was followed by a question in response to a question on what a critic was doing in the article.,"When you hear about a new book coming out a few years out, think about the amount of feedback you receive. You may think that it's a one-off. What's the truth? Don't they think that reviewers do an important job of evaluating the product?","It is a busy time at the moment. In a world full of books and the news that is out, the reviewers are out. So we were excited to hear what they thought about the story. Well, now it seems everyone had a good time.","The UK's top libraries are turning to reviews to write new stories and sell their books. Quite a few publishers are already doing this: they're looking at more modern books. In the US, the New York Times recently published a story about how a book's reviews change the sales of a book. Is that true? Do reviews impact how readers see it? Are they important? Have people read the book before? Are readers more likely to buy it than they think? And, how can a writer think it's a success? What have the authors of some of the book's best-known bestsellers? Why are many publishers looking at this? The UK's top libraries are looking at reviews to help them decide which books to publish. A review of a book is part of the company's new look. The reviews give readers a strong picture of a book's success."

C1,"Mike had a long history of smoking. One day he decided to put a product campaign in his car. He was frustrated because he didn't think many kids had the ability. He looked at the ads and decided to see which one was the most popular. He researched 10 brands and decided to stop smoking. ""The top three advertised brands of cigarettes were all made for youth,"" Mike said. ""We spent millions studying kids. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands of cigarettes. It took them many years to determine what was the best marketing practice.""","Charlie bought cigarettes from some friends. They had never been to a fancy bar before so they were disappointed. Charlie realized that cigarettes should be put out to the public. He explained that if they sell on-the-shelf cigarettes, they could become a profitable commodity. But he also admitted that most of the marketing money was spent on the industry whose main target audience was teenagers. Charlie discovered that this was true even when he asked his friends about smoking. He then learned that 99% of young smokers smoked the top three advertised brands of cigarettes.","Tom found out in 1995 that his company sold cigarettes on E-Collect. His company was trying to market cigarettes as a safe, high-tech product to teens, and he wanted to be the CEO. Initially, the company failed to do the research to understand the advertising. But by the time he got a sense of the advertising, his company had become an industry. He said that people are looking at a wide variety of brands, and were interested in the brand. Getting a sense of the brand's true identity was the first step in their marketing. Tom said that he researched various brands and looked at the advertisements. It took months to find the three most popular brands that young people liked. Tom thought the top three brands were a scam. ""We spent millions studying kids,"" he said. ""We knew that they could name the three most advertised brands of cigarettes. We knew that almost 90 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked preferred the top three advertised brands of cigarettes."" Tom was shocked at how much of the market for young people didn't even exist.","By then, he was a well-known publicist in the cigarette industry. He studied children under eighteen and discovered the three most popular brands of cigarettes. The most popular brands of cigarettes were: Jack's, Roper's, and Heinz. But he was not one of the first to find out that teenagers loved cigarettes as much as teens. Despite this, he took an interest in advertising. He decided to look for the Top Three Brands of Cigarettes. After going to several pharmacies, he searched several stores. He discovered the top three brands of cigarettes included: V8, ACP, Coke, and O'Rourke. He later learned that he studied the teenagers' favorite products. He studied the teenagers' favorite brands of cigarettes to determine which brands he liked. He searched the store for the best brands for teenagers to choose between. He finally found the best brands of cigarettes for teenagers to choose from. He said he bought all three brands because he thought he was going to love them.","Tom's brother rolled his eyes, indicating cigarettes were for teenagers rather than for adults. His brother hoped that he knew of teenagers smoking cigarettes. However, he made no assumptions about the advertising of the companies he considered to be an expert in the industry. He told the advertising giant he thought he should not make a mistake by not saying his company had a problem with teenagers. Tom's brother, a psychiatrist, didn't want to speak to the media because he knew that teenagers liked smoking too much and was worried that others might also. Instead, he asked a newspaper to interview the employees of the firms he considered a promising candidate for an associate position in a drug marketing company. Instead of telling his friends, Tom smacked his nerves and he got fired. He also told the paper that he didn't believe there were some teens who wanted to make their lives miserable. Tom's reaction was to write that it was untrustworthy of the industry to advertise for a specific brand of cigarettes. The publishers also believed that advertisements were written on a corporate level.",Robert grew up smoking cigarettes because his mother had told him about them when they were kids. He found out when he had a new job at the newspaper. He had to be the leader of the tobacco industry because he hated smoking. Robert wanted to keep his family from smoking cigarettes.

He studied kids and found that the marketing is of the highest quality and the company's advertising is usually free. As an advertising consultant, he is a bit skeptical but he was impressed that the public didn't mind them trying to make a sale. He was particularly interested in identifying the highest brand brands, as their popularity has gone down. He said that the campaigner was right, but he also recognized that the advertising was not popular and didn't want people to consider the advertisements to be harmful to children. He was particularly interested in finding out what the children's favorite brand of cigarettes were and how they could identify these different brands of cigarettes."

My friends and I were starving and couldn't take any food. My uncle ran out of the kitchen to eat. My parents brought the bus and my sister and me home. We had dinner with our friends and I went to a nearby grocer. We ordered the typical restaurant meal and we had a great meal. However, we went to a bartender to ask him about the drinks. We were very excited because I couldn't imagine him doing anything else. He was very sweet and gave me a kiss. He told me to wait in his room. When we finished our meal and did, the man said he'd ask the restaurant to help us take food. I asked him to keep them both occupied so they could have some more time in the evening. I then said I could help him in his room when he was in the bar. They had to be alone. My brother and I slept in our cabin for the night. We were very excited about this experience. My parents ordered a bottle of wine. Our meal was great! We spent the next twelve hours in the grocers and got to meet the bar tender. My friends praised our waiter, who was very nice and friendly.

My parents had to wait for the liquor to arrive at my apartment. He walked us out the door, we didn't have to ask his friends why we were leaving, and he wouldn't return the bill because he was leaving anyway. The waiter refused to wait and when we finally asked to leave we were told the food would be prepared.

C1,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is currently the worlds longest running distance runner. He is on his second year of full-time training and has only managed to complete 3000 feet of training so far. Nerurkar is the British runner who is capped at 6'10"" and has now done 8 marathons. He will start his 1,000-metre journey to Nairobi in January. He said: 'The steep climbs have been done at heights which have seen incredible heights, so the pace has improved. I'm a very slow runner so I've only spent 3 hours a day so I need to run at higher heights. I don't mean sprint or mountain climb, but I'm not just hoping for a long run on the mountain.' The UK is one of the worlds fastest nations and is one of the few places in the world that allows a 10km distance.","Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner living in Nairobi, Kenya. He is a long distance runner who rides the 2,000-metre mountain trail, as he is a high-altitude runner. After climbing Mount Kenya, Nerurkar is met by the local residents who are also Kenyans. At the summit of Mount Kenya, Nerurkar will run through the snow and through the hills where he will be greeted by people walking nearby. Richard runs past a pair of old trees and bushes to reach Mount Kenya, Kenya's highest mountain. As he passes the peak, Nerurkar is joined by a Kenyan friend. The trail follows the same route that a boy climbed at sunrise in Kenyan winters. The road to the summit takes some getting used to. The long-distance runner is a long way from Kenya's high-altitude training camp to his campsite. Ten miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi to a camp called Ciko Camp. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. As it ascends into the wilderness, Richard struggles to maintain a balance with the local population and his comrades. Nerurkar is surprised when he is picked up by a Kenyan truck driver. At the end of the journey, Richard stops in Kenya to greet the driver in Kenya and the two of them go to the top of Mount Kenya where the train is waiting for them.","Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10000-metre runners, runs to high altitude training camp at a Kenyan resort on a track that ends with a beautiful view. At the camp, he is visited by Kenya's lion tiger, the famous leopard. It is a mountain with a steep path which leads off the road from Kenya's Nairobi National Park. The path takes him up Mount Kenya to the top of the mountain, which is over 10000 metres above sea level. The path climbs up the mountain and takes him past various scarecrows, as well as giant tiger tiger tiger eagles, the Kenyan lions and a chimpanzee. The trek lasts an average of six to eight days.","Richard Nerurkar started out a half-day journey by bike to Nairobi. At first, he was an old fashioned endurance runner but after a few hours he became one of the most experienced runners in Africa. However, he failed on the road, which was a ruthless route from Nairobi to Kenya. Then he returned to Nairobi. The long-distance runner visited a high-altitude training camp to learn more about how to be a successful long-distance runner. His sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. As he climbs the mountain, he feels like his race is progressing. Nerurkar is one of Britain's top 10000-metre runners. He's a keen climber. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. Then the track is crowded with runners and visitors. But a smile and a sound of music fills the air as the runner takes to the steep slopes towards Nairobi.","By day it's an average summer in Kenya, full of tourists and a lot of running. In the evening, at the start of a mile on the frozen meadow, the track breaks into a series of sled races. As the runners climb up to their feet the pace is slowly climbing. It's a different feeling. At the top, an old stone structure forms the base of the track. A runner, who is also a runner, drops his pack onto the track to show it's full body. As the runners make their way up the mountain, a young man is approached. It takes him about six minutes. The young man runs up it, but then he sees the young man slumping on the track. The young man is then approached by an older man whose hand passes underneath him. The young man follows him back into the track and talks with the old man. It's the same young man with the same sign as the old man with the same marker with the same number. This young man goes on and on. The young man begins his trek up the mountain and passes an old man and woman waiting outside a bushesland. The young man climbs a tree, which leads to their home. His body is almost to the right of the young man. Richard Nerurkar takes one step towards the summit. He walks with a very slow pace on the track. The last time the man reached the mountain he saw the children being pushed into the edge of the lake and they were drowned. He climbs on to the lake at the wrong time. The young man is now wearing a big blue shirt and walking along a wooded trail. The young man continues on his trail, and gets off the road to get to the end. One of the hikers walks into a wooded area of the mountain and begins talking with other runners. After about twenty minutes the man steps in, looking for the young man who had not been on the trail. He points out that it's not a cliff but a mountain. The young man then takes another look at the mountain and the young man walks by. The hikers then turn a corner and rip a hole into the ground, and the hole is now empty. The last couple of minutes go by, and after climbing a steep hill, a woman is seen by a boy. The young man is seen with the woman again. Richard then takes another turn, this time over the mountain in the forest. The young man then runs into the forest, to return the camera to the rest of the group of runners.","In a Kenyan city at high altitude in August, two young men climbed the summit of Mount Kenya. On Friday, a sony mountain track leads off a quiet metalled road from Nairobi and leads away from the equator. Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner, is the first of Kenya's top 10000-metre runners who has been climbed to the summit. One long-distance runner runs from Nairobi to another on a country's highest peak: Mount Kenya. The steep mountain track runs from Nairobi to the high-altitude training camp and is only a few miles south of the equator. One of Kenya's top 1,0000-metre runners is from a UK country. It's the most powerful mountain that Kenya has ever seen. At the summit, one of Kenya's highest buildings is a giant sphinx, surrounded by trees and mountains, with several small waterfalls. The climbers descend into an icy valley, revealing an underground valley of tunnels and some thick slush. One of Kenya's highest mountain climbers comes down the steep mountain track, descending down into some of the slush. This is a steep climb, with steep slopes and small waterfalls to the right. One of Kenya's top 800-metre runners climbs a snow-capped mountain to reach this point. The climbed mountain was famous for its mountain's tall summit, as is the glacier-capped Mount Kenya.","Richard Nerurkar is one of the UK's top 10000-metre runners. He is often visited by Kenyans who have to be a long way from their home village in the south. In Kenya, it usually takes over five hours per person, and during this distance, it often takes six hours. The mountain track on the north side of Mount Kenya gives the impression of a secluded training camp. Nerurkar has used the track to walk his own distance and is the first of many people to attempt the journey. He also knows some of Kenya's first famous landmarks, such as Mount Jebel and Mount Alva respectively, which are close to his home village. One of his first ever mountain runs through the forest in the Kenyan Himalayas. The long-distance runner believes that climbs with the aid of these mountain tracks is the most difficult task he has ever undertaken. This is part of the Kenyan National Park and it's a very popular park. As the mountain track approaches Kenya's highest peak and the first highest point of Kenya's highest mountain, Nerurkar becomes aware of the climb and is en route to the campsite. This is a mountain track on a ridge a couple of miles south of Kenya's Nairobi, a famous trekking spot. After climbing up the summit, a large stout oar of Kenyan mountaineering equipment is placed at the campsite. It is a small piece of equipment with which the runner follows the road. However, it does not have all of the equipment needed to complete the walk through Kenya's highest mountain. He then attempts to climb up Nerurkar's highest peak for miles on end, but still manages to reach a top of ten."
C1,"Tom Cunliffe is a design enthusiast and can remember watching the motoring world take a turn a few years ago. His family owned a stag ship and he decided to take advantage of the seas and build a large, luxurious yacht to satisfy a new wave of boat fans. He was excited about sailing and wanted to spend time in London. When it was time to find a yacht to show off in, he had to take pictures. A real estate agent at the time had a stag-ship to show off and had many people come along to see it. On the day that the 'The Westerman' came out, Cunliffe called up the guys at Tolstoy for a stag night to take a trip out in a boat on the canals in the Thames. The boat was to be anchored at The Westerman for a number of hours before the boat was finally ready. Cunliffe explained he had to re-engineer the boat in order for it to become more comfortable and the owner can't complain. He also showed the boat to other stag parties, which included some very young stag couples. So he jumped into the water, the boat was ready. He even lent it to a family friend, the Royal Yacht Club. Tom had been thinking about his work, but decided to take the boat off the lake. Fortunately for him, it was a large enough boat with four people. So it went on in a big stag party. Cunliffe was the best judge of yachts, and his design was a real treat. His craft 'The Westerman' was a real sailboat that deserved the title of a classic. The design was well chosen by Tom, who also happens to own The Westerman, a luxury motor yacht made with steel bars, a stag keel and a steel bar. To see the final picture, click here. Tom's new brand 'The Westerman' is a £100million keel, made with timber from the United States and built as a boatyard and designed by Cunliffe's family, who has been sailing since he was a child.","This week, Tom Cunliffe, the inventor of the 'The Westerman', will be showing how a modern boat can look like a traditional sail boat. The Westerman will feature a sexy-looking design. One characteristic of a traditional sail boat is its simplicity, or the ability to be 'a little dragged away' as it is called. He said that its design was an important innovation. The Westerman was made in 1924 and sold as a new boat by the shipyard in 1936. Tom's design team at the summer Boat Show, a local charity, took the design to the new level to produce a 'The Westerman' as it was renowned for its versatility. It has more than 7,000 customers. The 'The Westerman' features a beautiful look, elegant appearance and modern design, and has been designed to appeal to people of all ages. Tom's design team hopes to turn these ideas into reality.","Tom Cunliffe is an engineer from London. He is known for designing a wide range of boats, and he has exhibited his work in London and abroad, including 'The Westerman', a modern 'boasting a modern look and feel.' These yachts are in many different varieties and styles, each carrying a distinct slant - a combination of shapes and sizes. Amongst these are some of his favorites, including a 'S-class' which is often found in boat shows. Another of his designs, 'The Westerman', has been inspired by his work as a shipbuilder: he puts the boat's shape with a hand - a feature he describes as ""a simple, but powerful design."" One of his favourites is a wooden boat, called 'S-class' which he calls the 'Mother Nature'. It's a boat with a three-piece hull - a ribbed design, built of concrete, with no ridges and a femoral berth - and a stern that has a top deck. A new feature of 'The Westerman' is a stern that supports more than half of a boat and has a narrow and low deck. The Westerman is a yacht, named after a man named ""The Westerman"", who designed it, although his own craft does not show this feature.","Tom Cunliffe has an obsession with hull shapes. He owns the boat 'The Westerman' and is in love with them. The Westerman is built around a single sloop with a four-shaft, four-wheel drive drive. Tom, after being called on to design 'The Westerman', has started designing other boats. So far, however, he has decided that the best boat design should combine old and new. Tom believes that the best boat design should combine old and new. What can he do to achieve this? In his own craft 'The Westerman', Tom can combine old and new. Aside from the traditional hull-shaping, Tom has many other ideas. However, the best boat design should combine old and new. Tom's boat designs combine old and new. Today, Tom Cunliffe's craft is a new boat design that has no limits. Aside from the classic styling of the Westerman, the design has remained unchanged. 'The Westerman' also contains a built in deck. The design is still in use today, making the current version of The Westerman a classic yacht. Tom's project is to design another Westerman. 'The Westerman' has a new name and, on the other hand, a new design is still in use.","Tom Cunliffe, owner of The Westerman, is pleased that his new boat has made the rounds on the market and is now amongst the few vessels to have made the world tour around the hull-shape front of the hull. A few years ago he tried a simple design but it was too complicated. He was asked to choose between a slick-looking, small-engined or unorthodox hull designed by Tom Cunliffe. Although most people believed he would design a small-engined vessel he decided to design in an all-new style. He decided to make a slick, small-engined vessel which he loved, even though he still had trouble putting the boat together. Tom Cunliffe made the first hull-shaped model of the brand by putting its new hull-shaped concept on the backs of stowage, giving the hull a modern feel. He showed his new 'The Westerman' at the same time. Almost all of the boats come with a new, all-new design. The top of the first 'The Westerman' is now a'stowage'. It was a simple design combining the elements of old and new. The 'The Westerman' was designed at the end of the 1890s by Tom Cunliffe. Unlike other modern boats, Tom Cunliffe used only the old style. But a new 'The Westerman' became the standard for a new design with a contemporary edge. The 'The Westerman' had a new design with a contemporary edge.","Tom Cunliffe of The Westerman went on a sailing holiday with his family in the summer after his retirement. The boat had already been stowed away at sea but it was still a little bit cluttered. But, in his opinion, it had a good story. Tom had a new model of The Westerman he decided to take home. The hull-shape was a very similar design that was the original hull-shape he had brought to the UK and they were happy to use it to make their yachts. But the best part is how the new model was created. Tom has taken the design of the Yacht, The Westerman, into the modern day. However, it doesn't look like a boat has ever been made out of wood. The Westerman comes to life with an impressive design. The design of the Westerman is unusual in a boat design competition. Cunliffe had his own craft, 'The Westerman'. The design was inspired by a yacht by Christopher Columbus, and it became popular throughout the world after a world war. 'My dream of being a boat was to get a bigger life.' The world was an island when the new boat reached sea level.","Tom Cunliffe was looking to build a new sailboat, a new super yacht for his family in the UK. After a while he finally built it. His design changed hands. After years of research, he decided to get a new one. This week the summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. On the way to the show we saw the X-shaped hull of the boat. 'The westerman'"
C1,I've been looking for a hedgehog for years but no one seems to know about this animal. I've seen one in New Zealand and it's a hedgehog. I had never heard about it until I got it from the pet store. I looked everywhere and all I found was a picture on the internet that appeared to be of a hedgehog. It looked beautiful. But the hedgehog looked so sharp. It looked as though it had been pulled out of a ball. I thought maybe I had a hard time finding it. I looked everywhere and didn't find any specimens. Fortunately I found mine.,"When one of our dogs ate meat, he noticed an egg roll on his leg, which made him fearful. He then told the dog that he was on the verge of dying. When he told the dog that he was on the verge of dying, he was disgusted. Finally, he told the dog that there was something wrong. His parents were surprised that it was not something they really wanted. When their dog bit through their teddy bear, he felt he might die.","When hedgehogs eat mice, they can be tamed in a bowl. They love to be tamed, and can even make small ball-sized cages. The hedgehogs only like to feed on mice. The hedgehogs eat mice when attacked and the mice are a little bit gruesome and tastier. The hedgehogs also like cats, and they don't like mice. They are mainly carnivores.","At one point, a hedgehog was flying around like a squirrel. When it came into contact with the ground, it suddenly pulled away and disappeared. However, the hedgehog's spine had fallen off. The next morning, the hedgehog was spotted and the squirrel was hunched up in the yard. The squirrel was not afraid of the hedgehog and ran to the squirrel, where he ran away and ran away. The squirrel ran back and retrieved the hedgehog, but was still trapped. However, the squirrel resisted and flew away, falling back on itself.","The size and shape of a hedgehog's spine is a measure of strength. If the spines are sharp, it won't have any resistance to being thrown to the ground. When attacking the hedgehog, it rolls over and rolls in a tight ball. This type of animal can be found in Europe or Canada. The size and shape of the hedgehog may make a strong impression on the bird. A hedgehog in the small size can have up to five spines.",We were talking about hedgehogs. They were having dinner. The hedgehogs were all in their nests. They were eating berries. The hedgehogs were eating apples. They were being talked about and they were having their birthdays. The hedgehogs were in their nests. They were looking forward to that day.,"One of the hedgehogs was spotted walking through the country in March. A group of animals came across it and took it. They were looking at different areas in the country so they could see the hedgehog's spines. The hedgehogs wanted to see more of this animals. They decided to put a few rocks on it. The water broke the rock underneath their skin. The hedgehog tried to help them, but was killed by them. The hedgehog did not know if they were being attacked or not, so it didn't affect the keeper. The animal was redirected to a tall tree and the tree fell on itself. Finally the hedgehog fell but could still feel some of it. The animal rolled into a tight ball and was later attacked by the creature, this caused the vertebral base to crease. The hedgehog tried to help it as well but it rolled too close and it ended up being eaten. The animals both rolled in the ice. The hedgehogs were able to get close to the ground and were not attacked. The hedgehog stayed alive for several weeks before being reanimated."
C1,"When they bought the tools in England after the Civil War, their jobs were mostly made of iron, which was difficult to find. But once they sold them to the British for much cheaper, they now have all kinds of jobs, but few jobs resembling that of a smith or a factory worker. Among the best ones are these: - They are more likely to go into a factory and get away with a little extra money. - They are more likely to get a lot of good work. - They are likely to get a better job by the end of the century. - They make products and sell them more cheaply and cheaply.","After the Civil War, blacksmiths began to grow up in Ireland. They became highly skilled at making metal objects. These made people who worked at the wheel of machinery. A few years after the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers. The industrial revolution began in 1871, when the government and the Royal Society established the College of Blacksmiths. They offered their services to everyone in need.","During the Industrial Revolution the profession of blacksmiths was mostly focused on weapons and farming tools. They are sometimes referred to as a ‘shaman’ because they work with a saw but are not allowed to act on a project. Because of their low level of skill they were regarded as a very skilled craftsmen. Blacksmiths began developing the iron they saw at the turn of the 20th century. The invention of harrow and bolts brought the world’s blacksmiths together under the iron hand. Blacksmiths had to produce heavy objects that were only used for weapons if they did not want to protect themselves. Eventually the industry was submerged in the rain and water and was used to provide tools and equipment. Usually in the 19th century blacksmiths began producing silver alloys. At the end of the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths are allowed to sell their products on their own. Blacksmiths had an extremely high degree of skill and skill in metalworking. The industry was booming but the main industries of production were steel and wood. Astrologers were employed to build and produce weapons and tools. The astrologers were not only famous but also talented. The industries they were involved in mainly gave out weapons and tools to smugglers, and were often involved in helping people in need.","During the first era of civilization, blacksmiths were the sole providers of weapons, armour and farming tools. The emergence of industrialisation made blacksmithing necessary. What is the difference between blacksmiths today and the years passed since?","We've seen the blacksmiths that made the hammers of the English Revolution. After the industrial revolution, blacksmithing became part of the culture in England. People liked the iron they used in the hammers as they were a source of power during the 18th century. Today, blacksmiths still use the iron hammers that are now used in the construction of war and peace articles. These tools were designed for the British to use in their home and to give a personal touch to their homes.","After the Industrial Revolution, a blacksmith turned a simple wooden tin can into a sword. He built it on the outside of a metal table and it was in use for many years. A blacksmith was born, so he made it on the edge of the ground. Now a blacksmith's profession, he gives a few items to friends for every day.","They were a local blacksmith who lived in a mining town in the area that had a town called Glynn. They were very proud of their skills and their way of life. They were regarded in the history books as blacksmiths. The blacksmiths were a major part of the history of farming. Before the Industrial Revolution, the blacksmiths were the sole suppliers of weapons, armour and farming tools. As they became much more skilled with their craft, they were also quite familiar with the history of farming."
C1,"Sally Varlow was pleased to discover a new national museum opened in Edinburgh. Its name means ""golden heart"", and there were three buildings on the site. Sally loved the modernity and architecture of the building. She also loved its new, modern architecture. But she couldn't decide where to go or what to see. The Tartan Museum is just a few minutes away from her school.","Sally Varlow has lived in her hometown since she was three, when she was born. When she was 11, she lived in the city, where her mother died. When her family moved to the city, her parents moved from Maine to Perthshire. Sally was excited when she took her family to the museum. On her way to the museum, Sally found an old English manuscript, which was an interesting idea. Sally was a little scared, so she went back to the library to pick it up. The library had a variety of things on display and they were all impressive. Sally, who was very young, had a difficult time finding anything interesting in it. It was difficult to get into it, but her family enjoyed the things in the collection. Sally stayed at home for dinner. The museum is about the size of a college apartment with lots of interesting things. They have an amazing collection of spooky objects from the 16th century.","Sally Varlow, a senior, opted to visit the Tartan Museum. To her surprise, the new museum opened on Saturday. The Tartan museum had a few surprises: first, visitors can see the remains of a Viking settlement on the wall; second, the museum's ice sculptures; and finally, the museum's collections of medieval books, manuscripts, and artwork. Sally is not so sure the buildings were designed by a scientist. But the museum seems to have built the entire building with the assistance of a small group of architects. Sally went to the museum, and a small number of its exhibitions. The main attraction in Scotland was the Tartan Museum. Sally and her brother had an outdoor picnic, so her dad set up a tent to hold the picnic. Sally then visited the museum, which was a good idea since Sally hated going outside.",Sally Varlow visited the Tartan Museum last Saturday. The new museum was open until 13:00. There was no line so everyone had to wait about a half hour. The museum opened at 5am. The library flooded before the art was to open. Sally visited a number of other museums in Edinburgh before entering. She found her favorite and then left the museum. It has been a while since Sally walked through the museum.,"Sally Varlow had a visit to the national museum just before its opening. The museum's interior looked modern, with a few art pieces. But it also featured a beautiful cheese-wedge garden. It is the only place that is still showing the cityscape. Sally has never been able to find anything really unique to see.","Sally Varlow took a journey on an old fashioned train. We started near the river and walked to the museum. The museum is open until 2PM. We were excited to go on foot, but the car sped past our seat. The museum is just down the road from the hospital. Sally loved it.","Sally Varlow loves architecture and design. She goes to Edinburgh frequently to visit museums, often experimenting with new things, but never settling for boring. When she visits a museum, Sally must stop for one thing to see it. She gets her chance, to see the new exhibition. The new exhibition features a variety of things, and Sally has discovered the exhibit in recent weeks. In the past, she has been disappointed with the new museum's interior. But her view is becoming much clearer. Sally's visit to the new museum was more exciting. So is the museum. The modern museum is in Edinburgh and its building is quite different to the medieval museum and the Tartan Museum. The new museum has been more contemporary but it does not look modern. So, Sally decided to go with her. The modern museum has a lot of things that stand out in its past. Sally was impressed with the new museum's design. The museum includes things like the modern artifacts of the modern museum and the old castle. But there is something odd about the buildings that stands out. Sally is going to be saddened when her grand daughter comes to visit."
C1,"Doctor Toby Clark, from Cambridge, England, is searching for the man behind Sir Edmund Halley's comet. The British Geological Survey is looking at Halley's comet and searching the earth for his true origin - as well as the comet's manifold features. The two men are a team whose purpose was to discover and study the characteristics of each compass. Dr Toby Clark – the man behind the comet, known as Halley's compass - is now at work on a compass to test his understanding of celestial compass differences. Toby Clark has spent most of his career as an astronomer in the London Observatory, and was the winner of the BBC's Planetary Challenge in 2015. A spokesman for the British Geological Survey in Cambridge said: ""His research on the comet has been a great success. ""His quest to chart compass variations will help us to determine the future... and help the world to make better predictions."" He is the inventor of the compass, and has designed and manufactured a computer for the time being. Dr Clark is a spokesman for the National Astronomical Society and former assistant to Sir Edmund Halley. His latest aim is to study the comet, to be thrown off display at the International Astronomical Exhibition (IAEE).","Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) was one of the greatest astronomers of his time. He was widely recognised by his followers as one of the world's most ardent physicists, so when he was 1677 he joined the British Geological Survey. One year later his colleagues were called to do research. One day Halley's friend, Toby Clark, is named a specialist of compass. The comet, which has been on the verge of being discovered by Sir Edmund Halley, has been studied by astronomers and paleontologists. Toby Clark's work has been published in the scientific journal Science. The comet reflects Halley's explorerships as far back as the age of explorers. Halley also flubbed his astronomical influences. A professor of geology at Edinburgh University, Toby Clark had been researching with Halley for several years. A pioneer of compass research, he surveyed the compass of the first three planets, called Halley--an axis of a spiral with a compass pointing southward. It is believed that Halley was the man behind the comet. The comet, which is a spiral of about 3 million kilometers, contains the planets ""Haley-Small"" and ""Haley."" In a letter to Alan Cochrane, Halley wrote that his mission was to chart the compass variations of the comets. Toby Clark, who was a professor of geology, asked to retrace the mission to Halley's comet. His quest to chart the compass variations was made during the earliest stage in the astronomy program. The astronomers researched the comet as Halley passed by the space telescope. In addition, Halley and Clark were involved in a study of the moon's arc. Toby Clark has been assisting Halley in his search to find the moon's arc. When Dr Toby Clark arrives in Glasgow and begins the research, the man behind the comet's arc will likely give the man a name.","Dr Toby Clark, a scientist at the British Geological Survey is attempting to record a comet that is named after Sir Edmund Halley. The comet which bears his name is located in the centre of the Earth, and was discovered at the end of the 16th century. The comet has three dimensions and is eclipsing the Earth in the North Pole. The Comet was named by Dr Toby Clark based on his belief that the North Pole is a distant star, which is located on a planet called Mount Adams. Toby Clark made a map of the North Pole and later made an important study of its size. When Halley's Comet was discovered it was torn apart and the Comet fell apart into several pieces. The comet has been studied by scientist Dr Toby Clark based at the British Geological Survey. The Comet is located about a half-mile from the Earth. Dr Clark also made a note of the comet's physical characteristics with a note.","Sir Edmund Halley and his wife were together at a scientific gathering in the Great Circle near Glastonbury and had comets to discover, that year. That evening they decided to fly to Glastonbury to check out the new comets orbiting the New Moon. Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, led a team from Edinburgh to explore the comets orbiting the New Moon. Clark, an assistant professor of physical science and a sailor, said: 'Edgar Halley's comet landed just down the road before a storm in November.' After a series of unsuccessful searches, Halley set out to make a chart of compass variations. Dr Halley said: 'From its first discovery in the late 13th century the compass began to evolve and it was very difficult to find any known or incorrect variations until the following winter when we had the brightest, most visible comet of the 21st century.' Dr Halley was very disappointed by Halley's efforts. Halley drew inspiration from the late Victorian geological engineer and the poet John Howard Halley. He told his story to the writer Dr Andrew E. Woodhouse in Cambridge where he also lived as a scientist. Dr EW Woodhouse was also a student of Howard Halley. Halley discovered the comet in September 1664, and went on to study some of the celestial objects with the help of Dr Toby Clark. Dr Clark said: 'The comet I named for Sir Edmund Halley, which he had a great interest in, is the most interesting celestial object.' Dr Halley took Halley's name from a famous astronomer and brought it into public view and used the comet to chart compass variations. His mission included pointing toward the comets and to determining whether they would be the best locations to orientate themselves to. During his research and as a result of Halley's knowledge, Clark told his colleague Dr Alan Graye, a member of the Royal Astronomical Society, to discover if the comet was far off to north or south. He told his colleague Mr Graye that Halley had been out a few times during the year and to ask the British geologists questions about the comet.","Dr Toby Clark of the British Geological Survey has been a research associate of Sir Edmund Halley - a member of the Astronomical Society, Cambridgeshire. He was a highly gifted amateur astronomer who took part in science and scientific research in the 14th century. He has written and published scientific articles on his work. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the Royal Society and has given his book, ‘Real north’ - to many scientific societies. When he was a child, he could have had his compass changed to work in science. His son was a geologist and he set out to study the Earth. He returned to Cambridge to publish a biography. Now an adult, Clark continues to make valuable contributions to the scientific community. His latest publication is ‘Real North’, which is due to be published in April 2014, and he will discuss it in the autumn of 2014.","Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is investigating the mystery of a comet called Halley's. Its name, Sir Edmund Halley, was discovered in June 1656 and is considered to be the last name of a comet to be discovered. He is most famous for his quest to chart compass variations. His quest was carried out in 1672 and was completed on June 1 165. He is one of the four men to discover Sir Edmund Halley's comet, and a pioneer on the field of planetary research. His discovery of the comet was carried out in July 1672 at the British Geological Survey's Station in Easton, Hampshire. He is the man behind Halley's comet and is an outgoing and charismatic figure. He is the son of Sir Arthur Halley, author of the book Mysterious Health. His research is about the history of planetary science. He is a well known inventor and well respected astronomer.","On an expedition to find the man behind Sir Edmund Halley's comet, Dr Toby Clark and his son Dr Toby Clark want to retrace his quest to chart compass variations. He’s done so for almost two centuries and, unlike other historians, he’s always a keen astronomer and a respected author in Britain. What he’s searching for is the man behind the man that Sir Edmund Halley was leading the scientific expedition to. This is a retread of Halley’s quest for true north - and the man behind Halley's comet. When they visited the planet in the 19th century, the search was a bit strange but at least the man wasn’t interested. Dr Clark remained true until he retired in 1890 but it was still a huge job. He was regarded as a brilliant scientist but was only a year away from being recognised for his telescopes. Dr Clark walked around for 10 hours before being interviewed and he found the man with the comet. He got a job observing the comet, but never knew how to chart compass variations. He went on to find other people that he recognized and travelled to explorers around the world and to find people. He discovered his work because he wanted to share the history of the comet with others. In 1891, the camet was discovered in the western Pacific and was discovered close to the North Pole near Antarctica. Dr Clark was able to find an expert at the British Geological Survey (BGES) who had also studied Halley. It was discovered during his voyage in 1892, and since then he’s been a leading scientist in the field of astronomy and is still a renowned astronomer and the man with the comet."

While she is doing this, she comes across people with a natural expression. She tries to avoid using her camera. She's taken a photo of a woman looking pretty like Mary and that has the same effect. The first thing she notices is her gaze. This causes her to be interested in the subject, as well as making her look uncomfortable and out of focus. Her eyes often focus on the subjects head. This gives the camera perspective and allows the viewer to look at a variety of faces as well. She notices the actions of people as well as the expressions of people. As someone takes a photograph, she knows she must be conscious of her actions, gestures, and expressions. She also realizes that some people don't want to be photographed with people and may not like people they want to focus on.","A photographer is at a wedding.

The Globe Hotel, at least, was owned by the inspector, Sue Brown. A simple request for lodging is accepted, so he asks for a room at the Globe Hotel. The hotel insists on that. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest.

C1,"There was one person who wrote the best job interviewer. This person is a therapist, but his pen is stronger. After having a job interview in a country you’d get a better chance. At that time they needed to use handwriting to predict someone’s performance. They need to write their strengths and problems. In some countries you’d likely be asked for handwriting samples but they couldn’t sell you. So why do handwriting samples matter? They can judge the personality of other people. They can also help you remember why you’re good enough for the job. What they do is determine the quality of their performances. The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support. The study is gaining support. It’s going to bring us even closer to having a conversation with the person who wants to hire.","Some countries ask for a sample of a person’s handwriting. If you apply for a job in one country, your handwriting will most likely be asked. This would be the most relevant handwriting information. You could have a sample of your handwriting for an essay. But if you applied for an essay in another country, you wouldn’t have an answer about your job. If the test turned out to be incorrect, handwriting should be the primary tool in selecting someone.","At school, I learned that handwriting was the major factor in people's interest. But I didn’t understand it yet. In a test that I was in I argued against having handwriting as part of the job application process. I screamed out in frustration. But then I realized that writing was essential part of the job application process. But handwriting was merely the beginning. The result was a person who was very self conscious. When I applied to a job, handwriting would be considered a strong factor that would determine how a person would likely perceive the person. Because the handwriting was based on their ability to communicate meaning, there was no doubt that the person was self conscious when deciding on a job. The handwriting was the most important factor in finding the job, and it should be. What did you do first with handwriting? What would you do differently with a piece of writing?","A psychoanalyst is trying to find work at an engineering school. While handwriting is important, writing can be considered to be indistinguishable from the rest of the word. So, when she applied, she would almost certainly be asked for a sample of her handwriting. When she received her resume, she explained that it would be the handwriting in her application. Then she asked if there was a chance of finding one. It took a great deal of effort. Then she tried to find another job. She had a hard time finding one after finding one.","Eating is one of the ways in which you look at yourself and your surroundings. If you are thinking of becoming a psychologist you have two choices: learning to write or practicing the activity at home. Learning to write means learning what you are capable of doing. The process of practicing the activity is one of the best ways to learn to write. Either you choose to study it yourself or you learn by taking turns, and recording the activity you are doing, or you try to help others. Learning to write is not the same as doing some homework or studying. The process of writing is the same thing, but different, if you are not skilled at the activity you are doing. Learning to write is different, but in learning to write you need to be more open to the material you are working on. Learning to write is a way to learn skills you will use if you are employed. Either way, it isn’t necessarily something you should do to learn to write. You should learn to write, don’t rely on something simple, and don’t be afraid to try. Learning to write allows you to practice your words and to be better able to make sense of a new way of thinking. Either way, you don’t need to worry about a pen.","The first step when you apply for a job was to know how to express your handwriting. One step is to ask a sample of your handwriting. This way, the employer will know whether you've got it. However, if you don't have the right skills or aptitude, there is a chance you won't be hired. The next step is to write the handwriting. You might be asked to write down your writing or a blank piece of paper. It doesn't matter what you write!.","You can write a rough copy of a letter. You might need to write a letter explaining how you would stand up to being a hard-working doctor. It might also be a rough copy of a letter you have sent to the editor’s office. In an attempt to impress clients, you might write a rough copy of a letter and send it to an editor’s office. What does this mean? You may need to have it to prove to clients what is required for the job, such as why you have a soft-spoken character. Your handwriting would play a key role in determining your suitability for the job. The more you write, the more recognizable it looks."
C1,It has been years since I last published my travel journal. I have only recently done one essay. I don't get much interest in the topic until the first semester. Now I am looking for an article on voluntary tourism. I emailed you. I'll see if there's a particular topic I'd like to cover. I'm looking for the first articles in the spring.,"The US wants to use this opportunity to help the poorest people. At the time of these initiatives, the disadvantaged are at risk. This work is becoming increasingly important for the poorest and the poorest. The government, meanwhile, wants to increase the number of people working for foreign aid. The author of this passage states that the international community plays a vital role in boosting the development of the poor.",Two academic writers come and discuss the subject of international voluntary work. They have a topic that they both agree is important. This is a great opportunity for the two authors to discuss the subject of the study of voluntary work. A good example of the topic of voluntary work is volunteering in Africa. They explain that work is done on a voluntary basis so that people can have an idea about the effects and the possible benefits. They also discuss that volunteer work is an opportunity for development and are not done at all by volunteers. These three academic authors also have a discussion about the subject of voluntary work.,"The writer discusses international voluntary work in his latest book in the fields of travel, tourism and education. His book discusses how volunteers contribute to the world and develop new ideas and discoveries. His book is a short introduction to tourism. He says that volunteering changes lives by making people aware of the difference a voluntary work makes in the world. However, he stresses the importance of human involvement. As a result, the author is convinced that voluntary work has a much direct impact on world economic situation, as well as international development. He stresses that voluntary work is an important way to achieve the world’s goal of developing the world for the benefit of the world.",It has been a long time since we had ever held the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000. Our research team has spent hundreds of hours researching about the benefits of volunteering to develop and protect the continent. We have gathered an international network of experts to share the stories of their work. What we learn consists of different types of cultural contributions.,"Those who want to know about volunteering in particular are interested in what is going on. I've decided to share an essay for you to discuss. A new writer in my class, David, is writing about how the volunteers who volunteer are getting involved. He's not a sociologist, a professor, but an assistant professor, a sociologist, or anything like that. As we discussed, he's trying to make an important point. We're all supposed to be sociologist, but there's some chemistry, and we're all expected to find out. He's trying to explain the effect of a voluntary work, the use of a volunteer, on human development. We are all supposed to know about a volunteer working on human development. I've been a volunteer for the last few years. I don't understand it. I'm not sure how much of it matters. It depends on what you're going to be doing, but I wouldn't be crazy about it. When do you say ""the world needs international voluntary work?"" or, ""The world needs international voluntary work?""","The writer's goal is to present a novel on a topic based on a topic that he or she agrees on. We want to be able to discuss the role of foreign volunteers in developing our nation. So this story is about two groups of academic writers with a strong international perspective. They agree that voluntary activities can contribute to the development of a country and contribute very directly to the state of the planet. They discuss the main topic: International voluntary work. They agree that the real contribution to development comes directly from voluntary work. They argue that although it can be good practice, international voluntary work has no tangible economic benefit in the world, such as the global economic benefit. So they argue that the resulting resulting benefits are purely for the development of the nations and not the individual citizens. They also stress the importance of cultural and intellectual exchanges and how these cultural exchanges can have an impact on the world. They argue that these exchanges help the developing world to improve their lives. They argue that international voluntary work can also improve education, help to change the way people think, help them make more informed choices and help make a difference."
C1,A. They go to the Museum every year for a visit. They get lots of compliments on the art. They find it fascinating. The last thing they remember is what is really amazing. They re-tell people things they read about the Museum in class. The first thing they learn about the Museum is that they re-tell them history stories. We find these stories often buried in our archives.,"At the University Museum of Classical Archaeology, you can see three of the most famous sculptures in existence. There are the statues of Roman sculpture, the giant skull of Cristobal, the statue of Aphrodite, the great turtle and the crucifix of the Roman Throne. You can also see them in the center of a picture revealing the statues in the picture, from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the Museum of Classical Archaeology, you can hear the crimson flutes of the octopus singing.",A collection of sculptural pieces of ancient art has taken up a significant portion of its time. What is one thing that I have learned about the museum: Every piece of sculpture is unique. Some are real whereas others have not. The museum curators have created a system to track the history of each piece. They then decide to display the works in the museum's art collection. It is a good idea to go here because it's just like the real thing.,"At the Museum of Classical Archaeology there are 6 hundred sculptures of ancient Greek and Roman art. They are all authentic, though the Museum tries to show it as a replica. The only real evidence of a museum is the glass and bronze sculptures. There is little evidence of anything else in these two art movements. The Museum is filled with art that shows the oldest pieces from the 15th century or so, while the Museum is filled with works from the 17th and 18th century. The first thing to remember is that everything is authentic.","My stepfather went to the museum in 1915 to buy a statue. The sculptures are cast from a sculpture of an ancient Greek king who was executed by the Emperor. He had the statue made before him by his father and was a celebrated warrior. It is his personal favorite because the sculptures make him look like his father. However, he has some problems with the statues and the museum is closed and there are other museum visitors who don't want to come.",I came here in the 1940's. My sister was having a concert with us. She wanted to go to the Museum to see what it's like to live in the past. They wanted a musketeer who was talented. My sister was going to the Museum to see what it was like to live in the past.,The museum was built in 1908 as a museum. The museum was on the site when some people went to visit it. They wanted to view the sculptures but found none. It is a public library and the museum is a museum. So I asked my friend to visit the museum. It is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world. They wanted to see how each sculpture is made.
C1,I came to a restaurant with a dirty plate. My first job as a waitress wasn't so bad. I smiled at the worst possible opportunity.,"My mother wanted me to be a waitress. She saw me kissing people around her. When she started working a day shift in a fast food restaurant, she thought she was too pretty. We waited until I got the job. Her hair was so dirty that she lost her eyeight. She was sad, too. In fact, she told me that she had a few glasses of water. She even grabbed a knife from my table and kissed her in front of my eyes. Her smile was so sweet! The next day, she came in, greeted me and asked if I was happy. I was a lot more nice than I had expected. So, when I asked her whether she was pleased, she said yes. I walked out. She was so happy! I was not happy! My friend said that she might get fired if she didn't get the job! Then, at last, she got on with a fresh job as a waitress.",I tried to get out of a situation but I had no luck. I had an appointment at 7:45 and I was seated. I was worried that I would get into trouble. I started to smile before everyone ever arrived. I took my plate away and had my ice cream. The next morning I felt a little sluggish and could not find anything to put it in. I also discovered that my ice cream had been burnt to the bottom. I was also surprised at the time the plate was destroyed. I rushed off and tried to apologize but they did not believe me!,"I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant and I was worried about a bad reaction to a poor meal. Now that I've experienced the first few months as a waitress in a restaurant I wonder if I'm too good for my own good. When I returned home I was told that I would be too nice for myself. After a few months of having to deal with being abused and depressed I decided to take the job. At first I thought I would be lucky if I stayed. At first I was surprised to discover that I didn't get to know anyone who could be as nice as my boss. When I went to a restaurant to take my first job as a waitress I was impressed by its friendly employees and attitude. At first I thought that I wasn't that good at being nice. I was then convinced by the manager of the restaurant, John, that I should be embarrassed that I came to the job and made friends. Luckily he liked my kindly attitude as well. He was very supportive and gave me plenty of advice as to how to get a job. Finally I started being nice to the waitress and helped to help the chef restock a dish for me. I was told that the chef would come out to take it. Later I learned that all the kitchen staff were pretty friendly and that the dishes had to be cooked first.",When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity. I beamed when I dropped the plate on the floor and it smashed into smithereens.,"I came to the restaurant once and tried to help the customers but had trouble getting them served. I smiled very sweetly, but when it did she ran after them instead. She wanted to give them a great meal and gave them to their table. I felt terribly sorry and began getting hysterical.","A plate was dropped down from my table in the restaurant. I shook my head resolutely and said it looked good! The waitress asked if it was any better than just a plate in my restaurant. She shook her head, said yes and shook her head. I said nothing but congratulations."

They are observing gravity, and measuring the impact that gravity brings onto the surface of the air. One scientist is amazed by the accuracy of his findings. At this time, its scientific research is being funded by an American Science Foundation. They are focusing on ""awesome"" observations of space flight.","When Tom Mumford first discovered this plane on his childhood trip, he was excited to see it. When Tom saw it on the ground, he realized he had been examining it. He found that it is actually a small plane made in 1964. It is the first passenger craft built based on a passenger plane in the world.","To test their theory, student Tom Mumford used weightlessness to test their theories. He walked away from his aircraft to the back of a plane and watched the engine roar. They then observed a jet being pulled by the engine. Suddenly, his aircraft was crashing and scraping against the ground. Then he flew back and forth from the plane.The pilot pushed the jet off the ground, turning it around and yanking it down into the air. The aircraft's engines had come alive. The jet returned to its normal speed. They took control to begin removing the pilots. The sky was hot with the clouds.","The pilot was making his way out of a plane. As he began to circle a runway, he saw an aircraft in the distance. It was a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. At this time, the pilot's theory was that the aircraft was a larger plane. The pilot was surprised when he heard the noise. He quickly told the young passengers that they'd just picked a good plane and left with the cargo plane in their hands. The passengers took a turn to use their phones, then a car parked outside their window. The plane flipped over and it felt like it was coming to rest. The small aircraft looked nothing like the one the pilot showed them. He said the airplane was a Boeing 707. The flight attendant told them that it was on the airplane at the time.","By a pond, the plane started to move downwards, and it retracted. The aircraft was stopped for some time. They realized the plane had been built at an unsafe speed, then started to stall. They tried to stall until the aircraft stopped robbing water and a man was found dead. They had to flee in peace.",Tom Mumford was flying a plane to school. His daughter wanted to study physics. Her friends took her to see their model of a spacecraft. They decided to use a Boeing 707 instead. The pilot thought it was just another ordinary plane. But they decided to try again. It looked like just another airplane from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707. The plane came with two tires on its tail. The jet landed in a single bound for the wing.,"This is a story about a pilot in a helicopter who finds out that his plane crashed near the bottom of the snow. He does so to try and see which way the plane crashed. It looked like just another airplane from the outside, and he shows how he created the plane. He tells his young passengers he built the plane in 1964, so they had to see it from the inside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built on the KC-135. The plane made a quick getaway and crashed in the snow. It was only now that the pilot finally decided to return to the ground."
C1,"I was going to collage classes to attend university and after a few days I started to get used to it. Richard Cork stepped out of his car and scanned the images. He asked to a student assistant or go out for a walk. I asked him to look at a large sized canvas of Picasso. It was not very large but had been in an open area so he could see what looked like a small art. Richard Cork's student assistant asked to see the canvas that you have on that wall and then got stuck in some rain or rain. He found it not so important as I wanted to drew. It had been in a bad state so I decided to just paint the image instead. My roommate then went to school and the teacher who I spent part of the day visiting, did an admiration. The teacher said Picasso was not only a famous artist but also a painter. I was so impressed that after studying the images he decided to let them come back. The school year was a busy time for me. But I was doing it well as it was my first time in France in six years. I then had a big enthralling exhibition in the city of Marseille. When I arrived the artist told me he had no idea. My colleague had told me I had never seen Picasso before. I got him for the first time at the Picasso museum and gave him a big discount which I didn't know. It was also the final moment in my study when I realised that Picasso had only just begun to be made a paint. I am just one of the 78 Picasso masters and I am very happy to be learning a new subject. Richard Cork is a visiting professor at the University of Cambridge, and is now teaching a lecture at the college this year.","Richard Cork is a 78-year-old student who has taken three summer trips to Europe, one to Argentina, Mexico and Morocco. He's studying a great deal to become a painter. He was an I8-year-old student filling in time before university by traveling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. At one point during his trip in the van, I ate one of the most famous pieces in the museum: The Picasso Painting. Richard Cork's photo is of a 78-year-old man, Richard Cork, who is in a state of shock. His head shot shows Picasso, wearing a red cap, a hat and boots. The young Picasso is said to be a close associate of Richard Cork. Richard Cork wrote his portrait in watercolor, and told Cork that the images and the painting made him become his ""world-famous work"". At the same time, Picasso's artworks were not only popular among the tourists but have become a landmark in the world. His works have been well known in his native land of Africa, where he won an Oscar and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973. The artworks were also used as a wedding gift for a friend of the couple, who is celebrating their anniversary.","A 78-year-old boy had come to Paris with his family. His parents didn't have a car. The first Picasso painting I made was in 1966. I started drawing a few years later. I had a lot of experimenting. I started painting with a brush and a light brush. I started using water. I became interested in doodles and learning about Picasso. So I started sketching Picasso. Soon after my first visit to the city, I went around a lot of different places. I liked Picasso. His name is Picasso. In 1969, at the age of 78, I started to study the work of Picasso, to which I won an I.F. The year I went on to graduate, I started getting tired. I started at school. I had to go to the chemist school and to study with the masters of painting. Besides the world I learned a lot about art and my friends. At the school, I got paid a little more than I was expecting. By now I was full of school to go. I studied the chemistry while I studied the painting while I worked with Picasso. I am now an I8-year-old student filleding in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van.","Richard Cork was studying for a PhD in Sculpture in 1982. He was a young I8 student and at 18 years old was part of a group which included Picasso, which was an impressionist painting. Richard was unable to get onto the plane as he was flying to the airport and to the train at the top of the airport. This meant he had to use a wheelchair or a wheelchair to travel. He lost his way around the city looking for an apartment so they started walking. He discovered he was going to get a job at a painter’s shop and got the opportunity to go and see Picasso when he appeared with us for the first time. Richard and I both enjoyed the experience of visiting Picasso. Richard Cork: The day I drew Picasso Richard Cork recalls how as an 78-year-old student he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century. Even seen at a distance eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour Picasso was instantly recognisable.

Richard Cork: I was an I8-year-old student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van.","Richard Cork was a 78-year-old student who studied painting and drawing. He had spent a few years studying in a museum in Italy, which had a large collection of Picasso paintings, and in Paris. During the course of his time in Paris, he drew various paintings for the film industry. On the day of his departure from the capital, he was so engrossed in paintings that he often hung the artworks around his house. By the end of the week, there were only about 70 people and most stayed in hotels. It was very hard to find a place to stay for his summer holidays. I came home after a trip to Morocco and was not even able to leave when the weather was stormy and rainy. I was hung up on in the sun just a little longer. I was one of those students who didn’t care that people would stoop to their death in the face of the weather. I wished he could have said so more slowly, despite the weather.","I was a young I8 student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. Richard Cork and I were going to work at the Picasso Museum in the city of Paris. We didn't have any space to go or the water to get around as we were travelling through Europe and Morocco. When Richard began to sketch his paintings, it was a surprise to see the artist alive. I wasn't disappointed at all because I hoped it would be a realistic portrait. Richard's assistant insisted Picasso was ""dorky"" and that we would not go there if it were not bad. When Richard got to know Picasso, he was shocked but couldn't make it to his first studio. He had to give his name to someone else, but I thought it was a pretty good idea. He left my room at 11am and went to the museum. Richard's supervisor asked how the paintings looked in Paris and I wished I had known beforehand. I finally decided to have a try and find an assistant that was a student. It was a good experience and I was very happy to find a very good person and a good teacher. Richard's manager informed me that Picasso was a lot of fun and a very successful artist. He then asked him to get a job in another company and I was happy for him. After I was done sketching I retablished my impressions of his works and explained to the manager that he should get a job with them later. Richard's boss had already told me that it was too early to come and the manager wanted a job with Picasso. He was also asked to send me some images of Picasso's works to get an idea for a project. I had hoped I would get the job of the photographer but I have to admit I was very excited to finally go and have a fun trip. Richard's boss said it was too late and I should have sent more pictures.","Richard Cork saw Picasso as an 18-year-old art student. His teacher said the picture reminded him that he is an artist. I've never seen an artist like this, and the art he brought to the table was so utterly oblivious to the public's knowledge that he believed everything was authentic. Despite my disappointment that he never did something authentic, Picasso was an inspiration to me, and for him so many things have moved me. As an I8-year-old student filling in time for university, I went on many more trips around Europe and Morocco."
C1,"By Jerry Hillahr - April 2, 2009 ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. It started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.","We asked advertisers to consider what happens when their ads go on the market. Often, those advertisers get their name and their products to go on. They often take stock and are disappointed that their advertisements aren't getting noticed. The problem is that they try too hard. For example, one year a week, the number of customers visiting a shop was 30 in the afternoon. Then they realized that customers have been out of their stores for the past 2 days. Then they decided that they couldn't continue doing that, since it seems like too much time passes. Often, however, people will miss the opportunity to use their products. It can be great if people can stop and think of their ads and buy them, and that's how that will change the way they shop. Often, the advertisement itself starts to fall into the same category as the commercial. They could use the word ""advertiser"" because they don't have to use the word ""advertiser"" in an adjective, but that's not how advertising will stay in business. This is especially true if you need a quick fix to some problems in your advertising.","Advertising became very dominant in the advertising industry. This trend has been compounded by global changes in marketing. The marketing world has changed, and so has the global advertising market. In the past, people would have loved to know more of what went on. This news was for the past couple years and it hasn't changed the way we view advertising. But the economy is becoming more competitive. The internet has been changing the way the public sees advertising. The Internet is being transformed into the world's largest publicly traded corporation. Advertising is changing the way consumers see advertising. Today's consumers don't necessarily appreciate what's on t.v. for the first time in a generation. It's easier to understand and find information and information about new products in the online world. This information is vital to advertising.","We have had many issues in advertising, such as the financial crisis, the growth of technology and the rise in the number of advertisers. Our view of the world today is that advertising should never have been a product of a recession! As a result, advertising has become nothing more than a commodity and nothing more than a cliche. A few weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal published its opinion that advertising should be an ad for a magazine. But there was no clear-cut conclusion and the Journal had to find a way to capitalize on this weakness. It concluded that, if advertising was the source of a lot of money it could not have been. It took a long time to decide what the future of the advertising industry would be, as advertising remained at least a decade old. Yet the Journal was well-prepared to be in the midst of a big economic crisis. For the next year or so, the Journal was in the middle of a long list of issues that were largely solved, but there had been no immediate resumption of advertising. Advertising must remain focused on the short-term - only the short-term needs for the long-term - and keep up with the pace of economic change. It is the only way that advertising is working or can be.","As the number of advertising jobs in America slowed down recently, new research has shown that the rate of jobs gain through mass marketing is up. The findings from new research could dramatically disrupt the job market and change the way we think about advertising.",AS ALMOST everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.,"A young American newspaper reporter was writing a piece about advertising and marketing. The columnist, Steve Levene, wrote that the advertising industry grew at an average rate that was 4%. There was a high rate in a small area so it would need to be lowered. He pointed out that Advertising started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The economic crash caused a decline in advertising. To make matters worse, an advertisement was relegated from the market and has been held back for several years. In an attempt to stop the slump, some advertising outlets changed their advertisements so that it was no longer effective and was simply not a viable marketing option. The columnist mentioned an advertisement a week earlier published on the newspaper. As he wrote, he noted that ""if it was really important for advertisers to be effective and in the service of the public, then it is a big step to be successful."" The columnist said the situation for advertising had not been a great one, so he asked how it sank. He concluded, ""The crisis isn't in the right hands."" One example of this was a news article in the newspaper."

A great deal of information had been put to use by Georgina, not to mention that she was able to convert it into an efficient work place. Georgina tripped over her laptop to get in contact with a person who could help and she hoped to get a handle on the experience she got. As Georgina began to get the job done, it became more difficult. She had to adjust to the changing world and the change in technology and decided to give a job at the same time. Georgina had taken a long career break from journalism and felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. She recounted here how she was able to transform the family home into an efficient workplace.","Georgina McGuiness worked as a journalist for several years. She joined the staff of the Daily Telegraph in January 2005 and helped edit newspaper stories. Her interest in technology, however, had disappeared. So Georgina enlisted her father in an assignment to build a small home. From then on she worked as an editor at the Daily Telegraph. She was offered the role of head of a news division. However she failed to achieve this dream. Georgina went on to be promoted to head office in the local council. Her father had a phobia of technology and decided to leave the post. Her father was very angry that Georgina chose a position with the Daily Telegraph. Georgina made a quick start and took her time to discover that the business wasn't as effective as they thought. She then learned that the business wasn't as effective as it may seem. On the day her father was interviewed, she realized that she couldn't find time for her father's family. Georgina started a regular journal, but was then diagnosed with ADHD and needed a second opinion. However, despite her concern, Georgina became adept at her job and quickly started gaining respect. Georgina helped her father to adjust the system by adjusting a switch in the kitchen and washing dishes. She felt that she would never see her dad again. This caused a rift within her marriage and she longed for her baby to grow. As it turns out, Georgina's job was to be a model for technology, allowing her to focus on her job. Georgina's success led her to establish a job with the Daily Telegraph.","Georgina McGuiness was making her family home into a place where she could work and have a family dinner in a few days. After the graduation ceremony, she decided to use her laptop to do some research. From the start, she was a full-time journalist and her focus was to help the public. When the news broke of her departure, she decided to plug the laptop into her house. She was not prepared for such a long break from her journalism. She found she had to switch out her notebooks to help her with the task. Georgina was happy with the outcome and was very happy about it.","Georgina McGuiness's career would never have ended unless she had switched to new technology. But with no technology, she was suddenly able to do what she loved - plugging in the home. She could use an apartment manager to help her find more funding for a company she was involved in. From her job, she now runs the same family home and writes about it, describing how she has benefited from it as an employer. The news broadcast shows how she has a great job and has an impressive reputation, along with her long career in journalism. She's also very proud to have been accepted into the journalism profession and can now begin her own teaching career. In fact, she wants to improve the lives of other people with her job and community. It's just that her life was transformed and she now enjoys creating. Georgina was a journalist for a newspaper and had taken a long career break from journalism to become a teacher at the University of Cambridge. Her work was on the news and she was able to use a new technology to help her. The stories in her stories have been well received by both employers and local newspapers, and she's thrilled to have been chosen to be part of her future work."
C1,"This is a story about the adventures of some young peacocks in their wild park. As they wander out to the edge of the park, a hen runs in front of them, flinging a red ribbon in their direction. The peacocks see this hen and fall in love. Now the hens think they have discovered something more than a strange new world for them. What we find is the true story of Charles Darwin's 'irony'. They say that their ""irony"" can be explained by the fact that hens aren't natural enemies, but because peacocks have an irony to hold their saboteurs from seeing their hens at sea. These peacocks also make their way to the water where they're forced to splash their tails and eat their hens before they have to swim back to shore. When a hen runs into them, he decides to take them to shore and slap them in a sabotage. The peacocks swim back and forth as the hens rip their tails off and smash the hens. Is that the explanation Charles Darwin seems to give to? Is it as if the hens are running around the water to find out what is wrong? Is it that there is an invisible threat, a curse or a curse? If there is, how do we know that nature is red in tooth and claw? Or are there just birds with special instincts?","All year round the peacocks roam freely within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. But when it gets dark inside, they are stopped and taken away by a rabbit in the wild. The rabbits are out of range, wandering about in search of some food or some hens. They begin to make noises but do not talk to each other. The rabbits are disowned by the hens. They then stop and talk to the hens again. The rabbits then run away and go home. They return to the car to find their companion.","In the 1980s, Charles Darwin's great science doctor said that the hens had to be hunted down and had to use a machine to beat a hare that had travelled all the way from a single spot. Then they could go out and kill a hamster. This posed a question: who would have invented such a clever mystery? That is where he was about to write a story about bird pheromones. The hens went on a hunt for the hens, but were captured by birds, and the birds were later thrown into the air. Sadly, the hens were killed after the hamsters were attacked and captured by hamsters. So why did they make the train? That they were hunting the hens? Because it was at the time when the hens were at the most active. The birds were so close that they wouldn't let their hens go.","A peacock tries to sneak up on a hen on her porch, and it looks like it might take at least 30 minutes to feed. She is angry at the sight of a hen and tells the park's keeper, Tom, that some peacocks are afraid to touch them. Tom argues against this and comes up with his own explanation of why the hens like to let them get away with it. Tom then tries to explain that some birds behave like hens to make them afraid of predators. He does not understand what the hens are saying because he says hens are a bad breed, because they live in habitats with very little sun. Tom describes the birds as a big ""tough"", lazy pig who eat hay when they lose their food. Tom argues that the hens are afraid to make a meal for the peacocks, because they think they can have a meal together with the birds. He asks what was wrong and explains the hens don't think their own weather permits them to have an irritant reaction to the bird's droppings. Tom believes that they might have an allergic reaction to hen droppings. He asks to see Tom and Tom if they think a bite is an allergic reaction. Tom shows up in their enclosure to find that the peacocks had gone on the loose, and tells him that the hens were very afraid to hurt them or hurt them. Tom explains that he can do anything. Tom and Tom go on to explain that the hens have a special appetite for hens in a closed enclosure, so they have to give the peacocks some food to eat. Tom explains to Tom that this was a stingy treat, but the hens do not know what to do about it. Tom convinces Tom that this sting is harmless. Tom then asks Tom to give him a bowl of corn chips and dumps it in the enclosure. Tom says they want to eat this because they want them. Tom shows them how to feed the hens, and tells them that the birds can't eat corn chips. Tom says that he doesn't know what he's doing or where they're going when he's on the other end of their fence. Tom, Tom and Tom look into Tom's bag and are very intrigued by him. Tom continues to explain that he knows what he's doing but tells them he's sorry. Tom and Tom are now angry that the hens do not want to hear anything. Tom goes back and explains that the animals have no food. Tom turns his attention back to the peacocks as Tom goes to check where the hens are and that he's going...","All is well with birds. Until a certain time when their trainers were playing with the female peacock in the park, they were not allowed to play in the enclosure. Afterwards they stopped at the park to explore the park. In the afternoon they watched the hens as they ventured along to keep the peacocks alive for a couple of weeks, watching them run around examining their feathers. They stopped when they realised that one of the peacocks had a very sharp tail and the other had no tail. The peacocks then disappeared to find their train running through the park. They were then greeted by the hens. They went to the park and were surprised to see that there were only a few hens around. The hens eventually returned with a message to the visitors in the park: if the peacocks' training was a success, they would have developed a similar trait. They tried to explain that it was an instinct and that the hens wanted to see the peacocks as a symbol of independence. The hens then tried to defend themselves as they tried to get away from the peacocks - for they were too big to run into their commode and for they couldn't seem to get away from their hens. They tried to capture the birds - they had to leave their tracks outside to get them to come back to live. But when they finally found a way to escape, they refused to go back as hens had been having difficulty getting away and started running into the hens.","As the bird watchers in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire are passing on their wisdom - a story of survival instincts, explains the secret to the nativity and their origin in the park. By showing them the animals that live there - how they came to find the park and to work for it - they'll be able to see the wild animals from the peacocks' perspective. They will hear the birds' stories admonishing their curiosity. Despite their curiosity, Darwin was nefarious, but the birds haven't taken it too far.","Every summer the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They reveal their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature, as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw, could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance?"
C1,"Humans are the most diverse group in all of our species. We’ve not only inherited chimpanzees from the past but also learned to love and respect them. They have evolved an amazing diversity of life styles and habits. But the evolution is causing extinctions. The fossil record of human chimpanzees is only 82% of the total natural specimens and 98.6% of the human population. That’s a lot of genetic information. The loss of these natural species is even more significant for human species than in chimpanzees. There have been many changes to human societies over the last few millennia. Some of us are even more zealous about being able to live with other species like our chimpanzee cousins. But we’re only able to survive when our natural habitat changes, and genetic material has made it easier to find new species to live with.","There is much to admire about the changes in the human body. Among the first to show the evolution is the ability to detect changes in the physical changes in the body. When humans learn to detect changes in the physical changes, it becomes apparent that they are moving the same direction as chimps. Humans can sense and interpret changes in the body to detect changes in the physiological conditions of other things. This is the result of different biological processes that lead to the different physical changes that are taking place, or in a different individual. Because of this, many natural traits are able to be discovered that change in the brain’s functions can not be separated from changes in the brain’s function. These changes are referred to as changes in the body’s physical functions. It also identifies these changes by their physical variations or the presence of changes in the organs or in their organ systems.","As chimpanzees have been in decline for a long time now, some of the fossil evidence suggests that they have evolved to resemble humans. The only evidence to suggest they had changed from humans to chimps was the fossils that belonged to their relatives. What do you think is most surprising about these fossils?",Our human friends were separated from chimpanzees at a young age. In a few seconds we were talking about how much longer it has passed since we separated from these animals. So what happens next?,"While chimps evolved to be a separate species, humans had not seen the emergence of a new species. These new chimps, chimpanzees, and some animals have all come to the same conclusion: a human is a separate species, while chimpanzees are more diverse. They’ve evolved as a result of some unexpected genetic differences in their genes. Which is why it’s an interesting story about how humans evolved to the point of being the same species. For example, humans are more than 98 per cent identical to chimps in traits like a “mutation” in their genes. However, in the absence of all the genetic differences, each species has just started to adapt. However, the diversity of humans to chimpanzees will be different. We humans don’t need to use chimpanzees for food or shelter, or shelter.","A woman was in a lab when a chimp was a baby. She and her parents were the scientists working in the lab. But suddenly we started to grow up to be the largest chimp ever. My father grew into a big chimp so she studied so hard. The chimps were able to keep their head still and swoon. I sprained her neck for about five months. Now I can see a little bit more about that. So what do you learn about this scientist? It turns out his favorite subject was animals. He told us they are only like chimps. That is, when a monkey dies, all the different types of insects move over its body and move around their body. Their body was not really made from a living organism. The baby monkey wasn't very successful in this regard. This has been my favorite job for 30 years, because it’s a beautiful animal. She hasn't cried at all. But I must say she has done well in her job. Her story sounded really interesting. She gave me some of the best chimp stories I've read. He told me they were all about animals not just humans. I've read the other chimps, too. I was a chimp and we have all said chimps are the lions. I also read about chimps, and they had one of their own. My dad told me we shouldn't do that. My dad told me to go buy another chimp, but it's a great chimp. Then, we were going to be chimps forever. I am a chimp and I have been doing everything I can. It's a shame that chimps don't show up.","We’re on a grand evolutionary scale because of the incredible similarities in our appearance from our closest relatives. We were separated from chimpanzees about 30,000 years ago because of a new evolutionary feature we’re going to learn, the biology of which we still have no idea how to understand. We don’t know how to connect our uniqueness to the uniqueness of our species because we still don’t have a lot of information that we can learn from evolution. We are surrounded by our DNA and some of our own genes and the ability to be incredibly different from each other. However, as we approach the genetic level of chimpanzees, we realize that our genetic differences are a few million years old. When you’re in a new generation, you’ve got a little more than just an amazing new genetic feature that is defining our human world. The biological aspects of this new development are amazing."

The four of them squatted around the globe on the Mount Everest. To keep an eye on the summit, they started off with a short trip down the Everest Trail. The expedition stopped in New Zealand and climbed the famous Mount Everest volcano. The volcano itself may not be what the hikers are describing. The hikers were given a lift as they climbed towards the summit. The mountains are not far away on the mountain trail, but they were very difficult. They climbed the Mount, which is the longest mountain on Earth. The mountains are very steep so they would take almost 180 meters per hour. Before the climb they were praised by a group of hikers who were wearing gloves. But Robin Knox-Johnston (53), who began his sea career in the Merchant Navy, is well aware that a long mountain trip can be dangerous. He was training to be a rock climber. The mountaineer had made the climb to the peak of Everest in 1985 when he was a paraglider. After an immense challenge of climbing the peak to reach the summit, he successfully completed the climb to the peak. The climber and his colleagues are amazed by the climb. A big reward is being handed to Bonnington and his wife Karen.",Chris Bonnington from the East coast was once a mountaineer. He climbs Everest for a living and has been known to ski for years. But his best friend Robin Knox-Johnston is now a mountaineer. The two enjoy ski climbing and are both avid climbers. They both have taken their mountaineering adventures to a wider audience. We can see how these two individuals can help us learn about climbing.,"Chris Bonnington had begun to use his acrophobia to climb Everest on his bicycle. He set about on foot all the way up the mountain, climbing up some of Britain's best routes. His best feat was scaling the summit of Everest in 1984 with his skateboard. He climbed the glacial rock as a kid and did not know where to start. He also did a lot of road climbing before he could even climb the mountains. As part of his road climbing career, he also started his own writing company, 'My Story of Mountaineering'. Robin Knox-Johnston (53), then landed on his boat, and went on to become a mountaineer. When the ship hit the glacial rock, he was swept to sea and eventually lost the skis. He ended up with his bike, which he used to sell to the merchant navy for $1200. Robin is now involved with his book publisher's publishing company, Sea Ice & Rock Mountaineering, as well as his acrophobia.","This time Chris Bonnington (58) had never camped on a mountain. Now he is a mountaineer that is often seen scaling Everest and has written several books including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. In a school run by the Merchant Navy, Bonnington was given a job that took him to an ice cave for his first snow boarding expedition. Robin Knox-Johnston (55) first climbed Everest on a mountain when he was about 20 years old, so they decided to get a job climbing Everest first. When the mountaineer reached the summit, Bonnington spotted it when he set off and was told to follow the ice. Then he saw the ice slowly melting and melting as he slid to the surface.",The man pictured at the peak of Everest named Chris Bonnington was known for scaling the peak of Everest as a climber. Chris Bonnington was an experienced and privileged mountaineer. He was the first to cross the summit at height and set it alight as soon as his first climber reached. He was also one of the first to cross the summit with any skill required as a climber. His journey had a profound effect on Bonnington's life. The climb was a challenge and he was rewarded with a reward. He was rewarded for his successes. The climb was a success.,"Chris Bonnington was a pioneering mountaineer and was an extremely successful mountain climber, specializing in mountaineers and skiers. He became the first person to climb the Mount Everest, which came in January 1981.

C1,"Jill grew up eating gum at the store in Philadelphia when he was a child. She began with 3 sticks of gum a day for the first time since she had been diagnosed with a concussion. One year later, he began eating 12 million sticks of it. But because of the history of the practice, the shop owners decided to try something new and started giving out samples to kids on purpose. But the competition got started when they tried out a new product for a gift. Jill is now working with their first company, the American Food and Drug Administration. Jill's research shows that children can chew 12 million sticks of gum a day. Her latest project was to develop her own gum, and to create a popular product. It took Jill four years to create the concept. The company’s founder, Michael Jenkins, has recently learned of the success of his experiment. Jill and Michael hope to use it to promote her company’s new product, “Digging Gum Culture.” Jill wants to show her some of the new products she has developed. They've launched a YouTube channel called “Dogs Are Good” where her kids can watch videos of how to do it. Jill's goal is to encourage kids to try things outside of the office and become part of the culture. Chewing gum contains less than ten calories per stick but it must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.","Americans do not like chewing gum as much as many women do. They are too fat and skinny to eat them without pain. It’s fashionable classless and the American Government’s rules in the US dictate that women chew 12 million sticks of it a day.

The Chewing Gum Culture explores how an ancient custom became big business as it is classless.",We've had a tradition ever since the ancient Empire of the World. We’ve had this tradition since the 16th century and we still chew it - as we’ve done since. Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. The United States government recognizes it as a food and requires each individual stick of gum to satisfy three criteria. We know we're a food manufacturer and we can all agree on that. The last thing we need is a cookie cutter.,"Chewing gum is the most popular way to munch foods and it is one of the most popular foods of all time in the US.

It may contain some extra calories, but these calories are what a health professional would require, and how this dietary change can be used to be successful. Chewing gum is also considered an invasive activity, requiring experts to constantly monitor health officials. It's important that people who eat food like chew gum are familiar with the rules and regulations so that we can understand them and keep the gum for future generations to eat. How is Chewing Gum's Tradition?","Chewing gum contains less than ten calories per stick and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. Chewing gum is made in the United States. Americans use it a lot. Chewing gum was invented by American Chewing Company founder Louis W. Wentworth in 1759. The American Chewing Company began making it in 1898. The American Chewing Company became a huge manufacturer of chewing gum. It became the first candy made in the USA. When the first stick was produced, it weighed less than ten calories per stick. In the 1840s Chewing gum was made as a novelty gift for a holiday. Chewing gum was introduced to America in 1748. Americans used it for their childhood. Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. The American Chewing Company is the oldest company making chewing gum.","American President Jefferson Davis, now president of the FDA, was shocked to learn that the chewing gum culture is becoming a worldwide phenomenon. It has gone from a tad unusual to unusual in a world that has become a staple in Americans’ homes. Its origins have been resembling a culture of ancient Chinese snack food. The slang and jokes that many Americans use to describe the culture of chewing gum and the habit have been widely spread, but in the past few decades, Americans have started to eat the gum more. Its popularity has only grown in popularity because Americans consume it more and chew on it more. Chewing gum is a fashion statement, and Americans are trying to make it fashionable and classless. One of these practices is called the chewing gum culture. During World War I, the US army commanded a marcher on the riverbanks of a small river to catch the soldiers. The chief in charge was General William Woodrow Wilson. He was the chief of the armed forces and took command in the battle and then sent to battle. In the war, the US was criticized for not having enough calories to feed one of their soldiers. This practice led to its disintegration and eventually severance.","The American Chewing gum culture is a traditional dish made to chew gum in the afternoon. Americans who are used to drinking water use that as a dish way before dinner. In the 1950’s, they used to do this to keep food fresh for their daily diet.

But for some reason he didn't get his first draft published. He feared his books would be a failure, and had to rewrite his story to give the book a better life. His editor-in-chief suggested he rewrite it to give the book a more favourable profile. But for the book, as his success in writing it leaves more room for heaving in the best elements of the novel.

Their parents were on the drive and tried to give them the gift of music. When the kids got there and got there the music started playing. There was a lot of noise and the girls went crazy and then the music started playing all around them. They went to the auditorium where they made fun of the other children who were sitting on the swing and doing tukehs and some of their own. We had to move around and retrace the steps and they started doing really well. After the three minutes of walking, the noises dropped from the side of the stage towards the auditorium and the guys came out of the stage door in a giant hurry. They tried to take more time out to get around the audience so they didn’t end up in the theater looking claustrophobic. They tried to make it safe to do so but the guys didn’t want to do any of it. This is the only way the audience will get to experience this experience. They did a great job!","The story was played at a theater where the famous acrobat plays with his wife and three sisters. After the death of one of his sisters, Prince Louis, Prince Charles and the King David departed, he embraced the people who had created him. King Charles admired his bravery and encouraged his audience to follow his example. King Charles decided to keep the tradition alive by bringing Marlowe to the stage. He has made the original Shakespeare play into an elaborately entertaining spectacle that was thoroughly entertaining to his audience. In The Great Marlowe’s portrayal of King Charles’s army commanded by Emperor Franz Joseph, it is hard to understand why Marlowe could not be prouder of his heroic efforts. Even his own wife, who was a knight, was deeply impressed with his bravery and courage. The theatre has been playing its magic for over fifteen years.","By day, the story will be played by Terry Hands, with three of the performances being staged between two nights. Terry Hands was also at the production showing a ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior that has been a very long-running tradition for over forty years. He had only a year and one day spent bringing the story to life. He was a talented actress who had been at work in a Shakespeare production from age four, and in the first of his many tours, he turned in a ten-act epic, not a ten-act epic. Terry Hands performed the play for the first time in four years. He had the opportunity to showcase his talent through a staged performance during the first three months of the play. His drama was described as being very intensely dramatic and powerfully emotional. The performance was filmed in the early spring of 1944 in the town of Westmont, Illinois, during the early part of the play. It took Terry Hands just four days to prepare the play, and after a series of rehearsals, Terry Hands brought it down as a work on the stage. Terry Hands, who also performed a number of other Shakespeare productions in the last ten years, did his best to bring the play to life. He also gave a number of scenes a performance to which Terry Hands himself gave the impression he had created a film about the human side of war.","Terry Hands’ play, The Great Marlowe, is having a surprise evening. He is going to play the ten-act masterpiece, about the all-conquering warrior. This night, Terry Hands will perform the play and perform his production of the play on a night that’s going to be one of the most exciting nights of the year. On June 23rd, the actor took his turn as the title character. Then the actor returned as the title character. They started dancing together. During their dance, the two were playing in the main role as well as dancing to Marlowe’s song, ‘I’m going to Be a Lady.’ In Terry Hands’ performance, the actor incorporated many of Marlowe’s musical notes. He also featured music reminiscent of Marlowe’s song, ‘I’m going to Become a Lady’ and was playing the man who is the villain. At the same time, Terry Hands played the title character on stage. The stage production also had a musical soundtrack reminiscent of the theme songs from Marlowe’s book. Terry Hands’ performance was particularly notable for her reworking of a song aired in a poem titled ‘The One who was my friend’.","Harry and Anne are both going to have a heart attack that night. But they make a good pair when Charles Spencer A. Tamburlaine plays in the play. A brilliant and talented new playwright, Terry Hands has created one of the most exciting and exhilarating musical plays of the 21st century.",A. Tamburlaine the Great Marlowe’s ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem ever-ending but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands’ staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe’s play with an exhilarating speed and physicality.
C1,"By the time films were filmed, scoutmasters were at the movies' offices looking for something to do. They looked online for good films. James Cameron's directorial team made this sweaty claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water. A Abyss: Long before Titanic is a film that director James Cameron made for his directorial debut this week. Cameron's longtime friend, former Navy Secretary, Charles Dickens, gave an early preview of the film before he made it public and announced his plan to relaunch the project. This film also features a short commentary by Nick James from the director that outlines the ramifications of the Cold War '70s. It describes the war's conflict '77 with the US and the Soviet Union and stresses the difficulty of the modern-day counterinsurrection by nuclear power. Long before Titanic has more of the tension and claustrophobic pacing that Cameron's earlier films, such as The Untouchables, have. Cameron's long and languid story of war is numbingly eerie and deeply enigmatic. It also includes a fumbling, self-deprecating scene where the wartime nuclear submarine crew is nearly destroyed by the submarine's reentry rigers. James Cameron's long time friend, former Navy Secretary Charles Dickens, gave a few critical remarks on the film that evoked the '80s' American patriotism of Cold War heroes like Jim McAvoy. They also discussed what his ideas were for the postwar '70s. It is a sentimental experience. Cameron and Hawks have incorporated humor into the film as well. Their ideas and characterizations are a mixture of warmly philosophical and lyrical. In an attempt to counteract the violence, Hawks has combined a lot of images and themes, including the Vietnam War battles as well as scouting for foreigners in WWII. The film's final scene is in front of a Navy armada in the battleship's cargo hold with a'satellite' on a dock in a barge. Neither the submarine nor Hawks seem to have any thoughts on how their story will progress.","The movie A Abyss is a horror movie. The movie was directed by James Cameron and features an interesting story of courage in a war. The movie stars Dan Stevens, who also does his own films. Foreman Bud and his men try to rescue the submarine and find that their rescue is unlikely. The movie begins with some shocking footage showing a battle between the U.S. and China. This movie focuses on a man who was captured in World War II trying to take revenge for the loss of his submarine. Dan Stevens and his men are a team led by one of the crew of the U.S. Navy. They survive by jumping, diving and sabering to save the stranded submarine. The movie finishes with the last scene of the battle, where they are surrounded by the water and a teetering star.","John Landis (Geoff Farrington) is a film critic who is writing a review for a collection of articles about film making that have gone wrong at different times in his career. The story opens with a stormy sky, with wind-blown trees in the distance, and the ocean sleet. John and his crew are on their way to the next film that will be out of production in a few weeks. John and his crew have been forced to return to work without the help of their friends, rescuing two survivors who have a briefcase from the depths of the ocean. The film begins with John attempting to rescue the survivors, but it slowly becomes apparent the storms are destroying everything John touches. In the end, John and his crew use what appears to be a light touch to save these brave men from being trapped in the water. Long before Titanic, James Cameron made this sweaty claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath the water. The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In films directed by Howard Hawks.","While watching A Abyss Long before Titanic, film critic Nick James reviewed some recent releases. In the movie he spoke of the two-minute long-time admirers who had worked together as riggers. In the movie he described the one-time admiral Bud Woods as the devout, ""devil-seeker"" whose thoughts he didn't share. What inspired him to ask what he liked most about Bud and the Navy was his sense of duty. A Abyss is a short film that examines Bud's journey as a war hero to capture the life of the U.S. Navy and the nation's fallen war heroes.","With an estimated capacity of 80,000 tons, James Cameron’s reimagined Cold War thriller 'A Abyss' evokes the strength and grit of its characters while capturing the emotions and imagination of a war veteran who survived a shipwreck without a manned rescue vessel. Director James Cameron made a film about an oil riger who rescues a nuclear submarine from the water at his home port of St. John’s, Utah. The climax of 'A Abyss' is a lark, anchored by a storm, then a savage, and numbingly violent battle as the crew tries to rescue the nuclear submarine. With the film’s emphasis on the submarine’s vitality and morals, the Cold War thriller’s plot is often an arrow to the heart. But a wartime effort to salvage the submarine with no resources and with no training and no supplies, the crew carries on a fight for survival. While the first film takes the viewer in a new direction, the film, directed by James Cameron, is less about drama and more about heart and soul. The movie embodies the power and the emotion in each vignette, and the characters take on a unique, unexpected emotional path.","On Saturday, the director of A Abyss was honored with a prize at a film festival. This was the first time a movie had won the top prize at a festival. Director James Cameron took the chance to talk to a fan about the prize but didn't feel much for it. A Abyss follows the lead for five years, during which time he tries his best to avoid being a villain. His team eventually gets a job as a nuclear submarine saboteur on the submarine deck. But as the submarine is attacked by nuclear bombs, they are unable to survive, making it impossible to rescue them. He finds that the submarine is in good shape and that there is still time to save them. As Cameron has done the same with the other actors, an old friend gets on deck with his crew and begins battling for his life. At the end of the day, he sees how many people his crew have killed in their respective battles.","Film critic Nick James sat down with movie reviewer Howard Hawks, who gave his thoughts on films in this genre. He offered a comparison of the first and second sequels of the series in the context of these three films: The Abyss, A Abyss, and The Long Before the Titanic. A Abyss is a claustrophobic Cold War thriller that explores the relationship between nuclear power and oil rigers and their efforts to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water. It also concerns the relationship between crew members and scientists, as well as the director and crew of the two ships. Both of these films deal with the history of the USSR, as well as the role of the USSR's commander, the President. As a film critic, Nick James does not discuss how well the third sequel, A Abyss, made any sense. But it's far from the first. It's a thrilling experience. It's a thrill to watch a movie like this. The actors are good. As the movie unfolds, you can feel the tension among the characters as they struggle to hold each other's nerves. The first movie also has the character of the old-fashioned Admiral Bud, who teaches her to think of others. Later, the movie focuses on a Japanese submarine with nuclear power inside. The film also has some genuinely humorous moments. The last movie, A Abyss, deals with the history of Japan. This movie was made at a conference. The only thing that was humorous was the ending. Regardless of the storyline, the film makes a great recommendation."
C1,"Peter Preston reveals that the internet is the latest in a long line of digital media. He says news sites – like newspapers – are able to navigate more complex digital technologies through the various eras of technology. Peter Preston, a new technology manager at MailOnline, says he has seen how the shift from paper to online — not to the print — can be a very difficult process. It's a big step to see how technology can help the media. He says one of the major benefits of the internet is that it can bring people together. He says the change will help them feel closer together – as it does the world of newspaper. ""I know that online technology allows more interaction – so we're going to have some friction. But the eras of print now aren't as strong as the new medium in print. ""But the Internet will give us new ways to communicate and engage."" Peter Preston, editor-in-chief at MailOnline says his firm is very optimistic about the end of print. He told him: ""I thought the process was going to be an unresolved process.""","Peter Preston had the idea of running a newspaper from his office away from home. In his final column he showed how newspapers are transforming paper to the online world as they moved forward, but eventually they made the decision to switch from print to the online world.

But with the news that changes everywhere – all the world is changing, and all we can do to keep our eyes on the future is think, think – he says that transition is not really the end of the world but the beginning. Peter says that he is trying to move from paper to the Internet.",In the past newspaper issues may be subject to editorial decisions. But the online world – despite the long time it takes – has been more open-ended. Peter Preston was asked why this is the case. He explained that the change in the industry would have to be a decision by the paper. He said that a website was a great place to start. In recent years the media has begun to think online. Some experts suggest that the future will be a place where the news can be reported without a lot of fuss.,"Peter Preston, a new publisher in the paper industry, said he knew it would take time to make the transition to the online world. He believes it will take up to some time and that the changing world can be an unexpected and a hard time when newspapers are moving. Readers are going to the internet and a lot of news is being distributed and scanned. As a result it takes time for people to realize that the media are actually moving. He believes if newspapers were to move to the digital world that they would be able to keep up on quality and be on top of current events. Readers are going to the internet and a lot of news is being distributed and scanned. The web can be very confusing to some. He believes some newspapers aren't changing anything for reasons that cause them to change their format or form. As a result the new technologies that they were offering haven't been completely free to all readers. He believes the changes in the internet can be done by merely looking at how readers interact and the changes they make in the pages.",Peter Preston wanted to – to describe how the future of print was. He got a sense of the media’s potential as a source for the news and the atmosphere of print newspapers. He researched the industry in Britain and found a few trends that he liked. These include the shift in the size of online newspapers. The change and change means people will now see how digital media works. There will likely be a decline in the quality of newspapers and they will have to take up digital newspapers for publication. What was the change in the quality of the news and the atmosphere of newspapers?,"Peter Preston, a journalist at the Washington Post, said he’s very excited to see the end of print. However, the post has a lot to do with how the digital age has changed the newspapers and changed the paper. Peter said he’ll look into the digital age while he’s at university.","Peter Preston said that it was time to switch from print to online. He found it funny. When he finished reading a newspaper's headline he realized it was a story about the Internet. After reading, the writer wrote that transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. The reader felt the change in tone."

C1,"I arrived at Charles Hurst's workshop with a blank canvas in hand. Before I started drawing, I looked over and saw the work of a great man. My face resembles a sculptural relic. I took off in a hurry and did not mind a break from my work. I then started sketching my work, and realised it wasn't a mistake. I then spent the next few hours making my furniture. Despite the pressure it was all a pleasure - nothing that I did was as smooth as a pencil in a pencil. And I really like working with hand drawn pieces. I think I can get carried away with that.","Charles Hurst is an American Cabinet-Maker. Before he began constructing furniture, he was a cabinet-maker but not a carpenter. When he was a boy he was very good at drawing carved wooden pieces but was given a long life and his love for art. The Cabinet-Maker is very skilled and can work in a crowded workshop. He is admired by many people around him. What he does not like about his work and his work is that it's a real man in a hurry. His work is beautiful and he likes to work on the side. His work is to do so in a hurry, he works extremely slow to do the finishing touches, he usually changes jobs due to work. My favourite piece of work is his woodwork collection. I think he works well on wood and will make lots of beautiful pieces. My favourite piece is the one he makes for his son, Charlie, who can only speak. My favourite piece of work is his blackwood wall that he builds for the family to see. It looks very nice on the outside. My favourite piece of work is the sofa he constructs for his son, whom he uses as his charlie heirloom. My favourite piece of work is the sofa he builds for his son, who has a big red tack and the fabric he uses for his furniture. My favourite piece of work is the little dresser he builds for his daughter. My favourite piece of work is the big desk he makes for his son. What I liked the most about Charles Hurst was that he is slow in working. His company has been great for 20 years and he is a very skilled builder.",Charles Hurst wants to make more of a living by making furniture. As he walks through his workshop the impression of being rushed changes a bit and he can't decide what to do. The cabinetmaker believes that he can't get a job because he's a very slow worker. He takes his work to the next level by making pieces of furniture that are a perfect size. But with Joanna Watt's advice he decides to make furniture because he is too busy to concentrate on his job. But that's the only reason he does not spend too much time on it.,"I find it very hard to imagine what the Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst looks like when he is at work. I'm very excited to see the finished work of this master craftsman. I believe that he is a very young, talented woman who is working to turn this very fine work into something really special. The man and his family are at a very prestigious school. Charles Hurst, who has worked a lot of hard work and is very friendly, takes time away from the work and spends his free time with the young wife. During this time, all of the pieces he makes for his clients and his team of colleagues are making their homes. I have learned that one of the most interesting things that I do is how fast he works so it gets to him and what you need to buy and how fast you'll have time. Whether it is a clever man or a shy man, they have a very natural willingness to work on something and then they do something important. I believe that the Cabinet-Maker of Charles Hurst is actually a young woman who does it well. I believe it is because he's not a short-term employee.

C1,"Charles Clover discovered a secret inside one of Britain’s most environmentally-friendly homes. To keep a safe guard in place, he ventured inside a 14th-century medieval cathedral. Charles has lived there for nearly 100 years, since his death. He believes that the architecture has always been distinctly environmentally conscious. He thinks the house was well known for the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. Charles is delighted to be able to explore the structure under his supervision. He hopes to one day live somewhere environmentally conscious.","In an oddly unconventional way, Charles Clover ventured inside the ancient city of Southwell. He visited the oldest stone church in Britain and discovered a large, green spire that is a large part of the nave and some treasury tower. The house featured a 'green' figure in its thirteenth-century chapter house with the same name, similar to that found in a medieval castle of London. The first images and findings were of Charles Clover's childhood as a child. His father, Charles, described his father as a 'green' man, having lived in a ""green house"". Charles said it reflected in his childhood, a belief he shared with his sister, Charles. Charles asked the bishop to design a new chapel for Charles' children. At the top of the hill above the church, Clover asked the bishop to use a piece of sandstone to make the spire. The sandstone appeared to be unnaturally bright, but reflected the sunlight. The cathedral was famous for its green and red decoration. Sadly, many of the buildings are now empty. The cruciform remains from a 13th century Christian church were left in the hands of villagers. Charles' cousins had been trying to save his father's tomb for years, but they had strayed away from a church when they first arrived. He went to the other side to look for a similar spire with a similar motif. He researched the other three churches in England, which appear to be the oldest. Charles' brother, Charles, told the Guardian that they were unable to find a similar spire that was visible on the spire. He then went to the other two spires to explore the old spires. There he saw Charles' family's religious activities in the church, which included worship with an emphasis on religion and science. He concluded that in England the spire is an important contribution to England's natural wealth. There was a significant rise in the number of people who converted to Christianity and have since been converted to Christianity. His parents, Charles and Edward, continued their support by transforming the spire into a church with green spires. It is in the spires that Charles and Edward went on a pilgrimage.","Charles Clover visited Southwell Minster and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it is the most environmentally friendly house in the UK. The church was built in a Tudor style and was a favourite residence for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Despite the lack of a single tepee, the main floor has been transformed into an exhibition of artwork which celebrates the environment. He made an impression at the museum’s gardens and was taken to see the artwork on display. The grounds around Southwell Minster were beautifully landscaped and colourful. Clover also visited the church’s main window, which was carved from a piece of cloth. The artwork was a gift from a lady who lived nearby and who took a photo of the artwork. The church was given a unique status as a memorial to the Earth Day holiday. It had to be the most energy efficient church in the world.","Charles Clover is a writer on sustainable building, a local community leader and the author of a books about solar power. His stories range from calculating the amount of energy from the sun to calculating the impact on the climate. He lives in England with his family.

There is a plan by the state to cut carbon emissions in its waterways and to increase the use of solar energy to reduce heat loss through the use of heat pumps. The City of North East Midlands will use the information provided to set up a solar power station to increase its solar power capacity to help meet the energy needs of people in the urban areas. Currently, around 2,300 households and businesses use solar power. Charles hopes to build a solar power station to be able to share the cost of the electric line. He hopes to find a way of improving the public access to energy.","Charles Clover, the Solar Survivor, talks about Britain’s most environmentally friendly home. In Nottinghamshire he shares his story with a group of villagers: A girl from Newark, New Jersey, got a job working for an energy company before becoming a full time Solar Survivor.

As his work began, Clover learned that he had to use a solar cooker and a cooking torch. Clover began a journey to discover Britain’s most environmentally friendly homes. His journey took him to see two churches of the great church of St Paul and St George, whose churches celebrated ‘green’ christian figures. The second church was a Roman cathedral built in the 13th-century. Clover was surprised to discover that there was a cathedral that boasted the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decorations.

The car had a high top, an expensive interior and an expensive body. However, because of the car's unusual side appearance, it was difficult to put it together. The interior looked like a classic car, and the car was full of expensive accessories. Clay had an old silver suit and a car, but he was not interested in buying one. When Carter opened the door to enter, he walked toward the mirror to grab it with his hand. He started pointing and checking his watch to see if it was still open. Carter was sure, but he hadn't looked before. The other cars were also sitting on the side of the mirror; they were already open. In addition to a car with two wheels, they had a minivan that was already in the car. The car was taken to the dealer, and he was not happy about it. The car was repaired on a motoring trip by the dealership manager. It would have been great if it had been parked more near the dealership in the country.

C1,"As someone who lives an extended time lapse like every day, I know how important sleep is to my health. When I awake one morning and get out of bed, the sun rises overhead. I'm sitting on a couch and try to adjust my body temperature. Sleep is a huge contributor to our health and well being. However, how sleep affects our health is being debatable. Scientists have far from agreeing exactly why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep.","After a long day of work, Alex is still bored by being bored and is tired. Her friend, a woman named Liz, thinks that she's tired all the time because her daughter is a junior high student and she's sleepy all the time. When he gets home from work, he asks what is the solution to her problem and her reaction. He says it's simple: he starts a sleep cycle. She says that she is happy and wants to wake up in time, so that she can go to bed. She then says that it makes her very tired, which she is. She then thinks of all the problems in life and wants to know where they all come from. The other student asked why their nightly routine made them sleepy. Alex thinks she might have slept more and she was so giddy. She wonders whether there is a special thing about sleeping that keeps us awake. We all have the same problem in life. She tries to help Alex by suggesting different ways that we can be awakened. The only solution is to find a new alternative. She suggests using a brain calming app. Alex's suggestion: if our bodies are occupied, we can wake them in time and sleep. We can see that there are ways that we can be awake. She suggests that we can be awakened by sleeping. Alex's suggestion is that we need to use a mind calming app. She suggests that we get a mind calming app if we are tired. Then she suggests another app, one that can awaken our minds in time. Alex responds by saying ""We can use brain control app, but that would be difficult to find. So, if we find that we are awake, we can use brain control app, which would still be beneficial. We should be able to get the brain calming app as soon as possible. She suggests that she should try a sedative instead of the chemical so that she can go to sleep. Alex goes to sleep first and takes the sedative. She starts waking up by waking up in time and then has to sleep for an hour and a half. She is unable to awaken until 7:30. Alex takes the pills for a break and sleeps for another hour. She wants to wake up in time and regains her memory. She has more energy and it seems to work. Alex starts doing a few research to know if this is good for the brain. Alex thinks it's good for the brain but she really wants to know that not every single minute is spent in sleep. She sees that it doesn't have the same function as sleeping snoozers.",Scientists have been trying for some time to come up with a scientific theory based on sleep. This theory is that people sleep. But scientists have not come to a consensus. We have already seen what sleep is like.,Scientists have been debated over why sleeping causes an increase in heart rate. How many hours per night does the rate of heart rate increase in the brain or heart rate decrease depending on an individual's activity levels? What's the function of sleep in humans? What's the result of this research? Which scientists agree?,"Several hundred and thirty million people around the world spend their days on average sleeping very late. They sleep for hours a night. However, scientists are far from agreeing about what this sleep makes them feel, especially in the early hours of the morning. They agree that there is no one-way view on how sleep works. The rest of us would rather get a night's sleep in the morning. In the early part of the day, some people just sit down and reminisce. Others go for a bath and get dressed. At night, our bodies are occupied with sleeping babies and we sleep. But most adults are still asleep at least one hour per day. What kind of sleep is this? It has nothing to do with how fast we sleep. So what does this say about the sleep cycle? It says that humans spend about one third of their lives asleep. But we can all agree. Generally a person would rather sleep in the morning. Or at least in the morning.","Scientists are rebutting many theories of why we sleep a lot. Some of them say that we can do things like dance in the evenings, watch television at the beach, have sex, eat cake in the park, etc. Some theories claim that we don't need to get up to sleep at night. One theory is that our bodies stay awake longer during the night. Another theory is that we can do activities like swimming or playing video games. A third theory is that people actually become inactive during the day.",A student of mine has a problem sleeping very early in the morning and is still unresolved about why this is a problem. She goes to a bed and falls asleep quickly. She then goes back to sleep and goes to bed. She decides she wants to sleep to get rid of a stress.

C1,It's a cold day and the office is very shady. All your chairs and equipment need to be well insulated and to be comfortable. We had to go to four offices to find out how their workplace was doing. We came across a group of experts on our panel who went and got to work. We were amazed how good and well-rested the employees were.,"We researched four office environments in Northern Ireland. Quite a few offices worked out well with their workers, though others were only slightly better. Among the most important factors included in their evaluation were:...the workplace’s ability to work well, quality of work, availability of new workspaces, and its ability to be adapted to an environment, including healthy conditions. Each office was rated according to its staff and job profile. Among the most popular areas of work were:....the workplace's ability to work well, quality of work, and accessibility of new workspaces....the workplace's ability to work well, quality of work, and accessibility of new workspaces. We surveyed offices in four different areas to find out the quality of the workplace, work conditions, and working environments....the workplace's ability to work well, and the quality of work environments. We found offices that were quite different from each other. We talked to four experts and experts and found there was a difference....the workplace’s ability to work good and comfortable. We called for a visit by a health researcher. What was unique about the workplace?","In an office, people are more likely to be inactive and fatigued if they are sitting in a chair. In another office, those workers are less likely to be inactive and energetic. One of our experts tested offices for ergonomic conditions to find the best work environment. The workplaces were mainly office space, with offices being primarily desk based. What you see is the health of the office employees and the overall health of the workforce.","In our world, healthy work environments can only help. They can also have negative effects on your physical and mental health. Today in Sydney, we are having an expert panel review how healthy offices function, including which offices have the healthiest workplaces. In the report we asked four offices to find out how healthy, productive, and happy they were as a result of their workplace conditions. This expert panel studied different office environments in different parts of Australia and found that the offices in the four locations seemed to be working better than the people in the office. Each office had four different workplace conditions. The offices were all able to provide the best work conditions and working conditions in different environments. We found that the offices in the four offices were much happier and healthier than their environments. Our panel was surprised by how good the office environment looked in all the offices and how well they were in doing. The report’s goal is to ensure that a workplace with a low number of unhealthy workplaces will be healthy.","A research team asked four companies, all with similar workplaces, to look at how their offices are doing. Six of them were happy with the workplace’s conditions and how they managed the offices. The fourth workplace was the worst. We were all happy and in agreement with a colleague. The workers were also working hard. The staff was unsatisfied with the offices’ working conditions. The only positive feedback was that they enjoyed working well at their offices. The workers wanted to learn to improve their working condition, but their offices were far from perfect. The staff were not satisfied, or slept in their homes, and no ones were around them at work. The workplace was very comfortable. The office floor surface area was a little hard to clean and slippery. The employees were not happy with the surfaces, but benefited.","In a office on the corner of a house, workers should be comfortable. The result is that workers get more work done. The workplaces are full of good and good ergonomics, although the workplaces are a little too busy to walk on. The office’s atmosphere is very inviting and has a lot of natural light, so the employees are getting a relaxing relaxing and comfortable break. For the past 4 years, the environment has been shabby but the office's staff are able to change. In our report, we asked four experts to look at how the workspace is for the purpose of working on a project. We found that the staff, including employees, who work in the offices, were not getting the energy they deserve. In one of the offices, employees needed to get access to more natural light, especially at weekends. The next day, an office worker asked if he admired his boss’s work because his boss had asked for more natural light. He was angry at the boss’s dismissal and decided to try it in the office. In the next three weeks, his office employees will need a lot of extra work, as well as extra supplies and furniture.","A survey by Dr. Elizabeth Sherriman showed that offices with a low level of oxygen supply will be more likely to work at a lower stress level than offices with a very low level of oxygen supply. The results of the survey were published in the Journal of Business, Human Health and Business Sciences. The study showed that offices with high levels of oxygen and a very low level of oxygen were generally healthier than offices with a lower level of oxygen. We also found that offices with a low level of oxygen and a high level of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration would be less likely to work at a higher stress level. The final objective of the survey was to assess whether offices with a very low rate of energy supply were more likely to work at a lower stress level."

My relationship has been strained over time, and for that reason I'm not proud of anything.","I recently took my son and I on an adventure. My baby is due this year. I have had some serious accidents during the last few months that have left it in doubt. The doctor suggested the best path to take for the child was to make an emergency call for help. My son had a bad night. I found a hospital in the state that did not provide emergency medical care. I saw the emergency room but my son was not yet ready for surgery so I went back in. My wife and I are not prepared for surgery but we plan to take the baby home in June. I woke up a couple of hours early and was told that doctors were on the way. I told my boss about their emergency room run and I gave up. My son is still recovering and I still see the doctor at the hospital. She told me that she would be there in the day. The doctor told me that the heart starts beating faster so I'll take her seriously. In the morning I went to bed and I was ready to be put to bed. My baby is now in her own bed. It is a beautiful day and everyone's happy that my daughter is here. So how does it feel? I tried all of the different ways to feed the baby but none worked. I gave my son a bath and she says that I'll feed her. I really hope I can do that. I still keep in touch with my daughter but they are not there to feed my daughter. Despite the fact that I have a different view of the world then the kids are now a couple of hours before I'd like to see a maternity leave.

I sat down and talked to my co-workers about it. I was then offered a chance to quit smoking when I saw they were approving and I stopped. I was very angry I couldn’t even stop smoking. Then I decided to do it again.","By far the most unpleasant day had come for me, because I had smoked almost all the time and had been in a long-term habit for decades. But, like many people, I started to smell like cigarettes. I stopped to smoke and the smoke quickly stopped causing me to feel worse. What do you mean, that after you smoke I will stop? There is nothing wrong with smoking when you have taken an interest in smoking. I had to go to work today and try not to smoke that much, I still have a half-year-old daughter.",I was at a party and had been smoking for an hour. By then I had smoked for hours. I had to stop! I finally spooked and let my colleagues know about my smoking.,I had been on the wrong drugs for hours one afternoon and was already in pain and exhausted. But I suddenly stopped taking them because of the habit. The narrator was the unlucky one. It was an easy way to make an annoying and unpleasant co-worker uncomfortable. He would congratulate himself and be surprised when his colleagues realised he still had his habit.
C2,"My handwriting was at a standstill and I was still in the process of editing. My writing skills dwindled, but the handwriting gave me a great deal of clarity and energy. Today, I would have rewritten them 5 times over.","I wrote an essay while sitting down and went to class. I was writing, sitting down and studying. I looked at the writing paper with my thumb and a middle finger and found a long line of papers on the screen. I wrote it with the hand and the thumb, forming a cross. After about 15 seconds of reading, I was satisfied with the number of notes I had already written and had a good grasp on what I had written. After a few minutes I found a paper that I could add and changed to make it more concise. I had been able to read the essay for at least twenty-five minutes. I wrote it again but not a half way through. Today I would have rewritten the essay five times over.","After my college essays arrived in school I wrote a lot of them. I kept them for the exam which was nice to hear. Then, I started to read them. I couldn't wait to see them over and over. I rewritten them at least once, and thought for a few minutes when I finished. Today I wrote about 80% of them.","Laura Johnson was trying to explain to me why writing by hand was hard. He had learned it well at school and had a master’s degree in philosophy. The more I wrote, the more I liked it. Every handwritten essay from my class had a different set of guidelines. There is a particular word or sentence that you must use in your essay. If your writing is written on a screen, it does not have to be as difficult as you think it should be. If the passage is easy and straightforward, you will find it more easily and easier to read, while your essay itself is the easiest to read. What did Johnson teach us when he was not teaching? How to read? What do you think about the difference between this and your own writing style? When I re-write it, the lines and punctuation are more concise and will give you much more clarity and precision. By handwriting it means you have to try to be smarter to impress and the text or grammar or style will not be your best friend. To help you learn how to write a good essay, you can choose between this and this sentence.","I was studying the history of letters for a class. I was a nerd and a shy student. All the time I got so lost in class a new student was reading it. Now I know why not. But writing has been a very important part of my life, resulting in many rewritings. One day my students began to read my letters, and I realized how improbable they were. I got a book deal, and I resigned myself to writing them. The second time, I decided to write my letters on hand, and I rewrote them. For this assignment, I would have written my school essays with a handwriting test. Today I wrote them five times over.",A young girl asked me if I had ever rewrote her school essays. She sounded a bit naughty and said: ‘That’s what you eat and read. ‘None of this is a surprise.,A teacher gave me a handwritten handwritten essay. I couldn’t have written it any better. I now spend a lot more time writing. I have a hard time writing. So I take it upon myself to read it every day! What do you think?
C2,"I decided to walk into town, after seeing the map and reading the brochure. On the way back down the sidewalk I noticed an orange cross shining on my shirt. I walked quickly past the cross but instead glanced over to the red cross. I walked away with my luggage.",By noon my temperature was already in the 80s. I wanted to walk up to the landmark. I went by myself and my dog to the sidewalk and sat outside tethered away. My dog was getting wet and I was a little scared. The dusk had deepened the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth.,"I saw a rainbow in the sky. Earlier in the evening, we stopped at a local bookstore and looked at the illuminated map of Philadelphia. I arrived early at the bookstore and decided to try it. I wandered along the sidewalk towards the narrow part of the street I was walking on. It was dark. I walked slowly for a bit and ended up at a side street whose sidewalk I was standing on.","Philadelphia Avenue was closed until midnight. We decided to continue walking to get to the ER. I found that on the other side of the street, there was a heavy fog. My parents had stopped at the road at the end of our hike. Then I approached a building and parked with a sign stating it would be open until 2am. Our car passed by and we began to walk to a ER.",The rain was on my sidewalk for the last day of the week.

The sidewalks were lined with old houses. The road was the only thing in sight that looked like it could get wet. I made my way to the bus stand and stood there waiting for the bus. As I approached, the car sped off and turned around. The bus didn't seem able to start until the other side of the street opened. I had to give it a try.",I walked on an old side street and walked to a street near my house with my phone in hand. It was beautiful at night and I ate the smell of smoke.

C2,"Albert Einstein is a brilliant man who has patented the concept of fMRI. Einstein has spent many years in academia and he has made an influence on people around him. He has been rehabilitated through the efforts of his research doctoral assistants. He has become an advocate for scientific research and his book, the scientific journal, is an example of what Einstein is putting out there.","On this day, a stranger asks a scientist to name something they think will help explain the Universe. Einstein is not interested in his name, he simply wants to say something about what he has done. As an experiment, Einstein is forced to sell his own products. However, people are more inclined to think of Einstein, as he has invented things. He has been the subject of lots of studies and books by scientists. His face is often displayed in advertisements for a wide variety of things from computers to encyclopedias. He also shares an appreciation for his own discoveries and wants everyone to identify it as an intellectual. His research is the focus of many popular science stories and the result of his work is often used as a marketing tool.","Albert Einstein founded the Einstein Laboratory which has over 700 patents and inventors. Albert is the inventor of many of the most famous scientific inventions. In 2012, Einstein and his friends built their first computer using a computer with Einstein’s face on it. In February 2016, the group discovered a new chemical element, a radioactive molecule, which gave scientists access to the universe. The discovery led to the birth of a new drug for humans. The discovery was soon followed by an astronomical revolution.","Einstein, our first and favourite scientist, came up with a nickname despite being an innumerable number. His face is an advertising tool for electronics, computers and encyclopaedias. He made him famous when he published articles about the creation of a computer, an encyclopaedia, and a science fiction novel. In the 1980s, he did a very small series of ads in the newspaper that have a positive influence on the company. He got more attention in the media by offering to take pictures of Einstein in various places. Einstein is a very famous physicist and inventor. It has gained a lot of attention in a wide variety of mediums. His name is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias.","Albert Einstein is a famous writer and engineer. He is not easily identifiable by anyone with good eye sight, but when a stranger asks him what he looks like to him, he comes to the fore, tells him he’s a scientist, and then tells him he’s a mathematician. Einstein is also known as an inventor, who developed a technology and was a pioneer of physics. One day Einstein comes to America to test his science. He gets a big offer to patent his work. Einstein knows that the first scientist isn’t that famous. He starts a commercial campaign for his work and sells it to people. This attracts more people to his work, so he’s an advertisement for his works. Einstein’s story is simple enough but it makes a difference if you ask the same person whose work you’re reading. In the past Einstein wrote a book describing the science of our universe, which includes his name and explanation. But when he became famous, the scientists and engineers from around the world began using his name. By advertising products with his name, people would recognize his work, and Einstein would become famous.","Albert Einstein is a famous scientist in Switzerland. He tells the crowd about how he thinks people will associate Einstein with him. When someone in the street asks him to name an inventor, he comes up with his name. His smile is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias. In physics class, he plays with a model of a scientist. The movie of Einstein makes fun of Einstein’s name too. His name is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias.","Albert Einstein had a famous face and was known as Einstein. He asked people to name a scientist who did something revolutionary. He made products that he loved. He also endorsed and sold some products he invented. As people asked him to name a scientist, he told them his face was used to promote intellectual connotations from computers to encyclopaedias. They thought his face was a compliment and that it was a sign of admiration."
C2,"Amateur Astronomy is about to introduce you to a new field in science. The scope, scopes, and scopes are on the market! Amateur Astronomy has been in existence for more than 50 years. In a few hundred years there have been a lot of advances. Some of the most recent advancements are telescopes, telescopes, and new astronomical devices. Most astronomers, however, seem to be concentrating on practical uses of telescopes. And this makes amateurs very enthusiastic about their work. This is why these experts come out with their own publications. These publications focus on the scientific applications of astronomy. Many of them offer insight and insight on practical applications of astronomy. They are not the only one who likes the new products. Several are open to everyone, including people of every age. During the past 50 years amateur astronomers have been raising their science collection to include every astronomical element possible. Some are now offering free software and ebooks, some for free or on-demand. The majority of amateurs and astronomers consider practical astronomy to be the most exciting field in science.","It was a great adventure to find the moons of the sky. This time of year, you would probably find out the first signs of a faint moon. To find the most out of these, look online at the BBC website. There are almost 30 years until we'll see the moon and its rings. We'll give you a great overview.",The hobby of Amateur Astronomy is largely developed by amateur amateurs to try and find a good way to learn about the world around the sun. In the 1950s and 1960s amateur astronomy was considered a highly advanced field of science. Today amateur astronomy is almost totally out of touch with its original origins.,"When I had a friend teach me this at school, I thought, oh yes, it would be interesting. My classmate, Mike, was a very literate and good-natured amateur astronomer who looked at the sky in the early 20th century with a big smile. Besides, Mike was very knowledgeable about telescopes and modern astronomy. Mike was a friend of mine and had an interest in how modern astronomy has influenced modern science. Mike became involved in amateur astronomy over the last 30 years. He kept observing with other people, who didn't know it was that important. He was amazed and moved to astronomy. Mike and Mike had an astronomy lab, and Mike found a telescope that was easy to install and had a good view. Mike was very surprised when he learned of the new equipment. Mike explained that he only had three telescopes and could not afford the necessary budget and was willing to pay for a new one. Mike's dad had a hard time understanding how his kids saw the stars. He agreed that it was time to change. This was the point of his trip. Mike's friend, Dr. Keith A. Reifen, taught Mike astronomy at the local optician convention in St. Paul. Keith's father used his telescope as a test project. After the competition, Mike's friend, Dr. Charles Wender, got in touch with Mike about the telescope and its potential use. Mike became interested in astronomy and he made a new friend of mine. Mike began showing people around the globe the space telescopes. Mike's dad was a very successful and friendly scientist, and he also spent a lot of time learning about the telescopes. So his hobby became more and more interesting.","In astronomy, there are a few things you would find if you knew someone who had practiced astronomy for years. There are a few books on practical astronomy in the library that might give you a nice glimpse of their work. The library has many telescopic resources but the library itself is a mess. The information on astronomy today doesn't offer a lot of information and is difficult to research. The library provides information such as how to read and write a chart. Is there something you can do? There are a few resources online that can help you. We have a great amount of books in astronomy in the library that can help you re-teach astronomy.","I was at college for a school tour. My parents sent a few students on a trip to China where the most famous celestial landmarks in their world were located. When they walked in, the people inside were excited and moved quickly along. However, they were still in a hurry because of the huge inventory of books. A large collection of astronomical books included all of these books. After the trip I had been in a big circle about 6,000 feet in length that I never knew existed. I was amazed to find out that astronomy was alive even before the time of the American Civil War. As I looked at the books, I realized that I really was in an army and were very wary of foreign objects. Before deciding where to go, I asked my friends to read some of the books so that I would know where and when they were traveling. Since there were a big supply of books that weren't for a large amount of people it seemed like a great deal of people lived on the prairies because there were few books on practical astronomy. While my friends were talking about the books I hoped to give some examples of how they could learn. My friends looked through the books, and they were amazed that they all were real scientists. I asked a few people if I could help them find out more about what was in the books. I finally found out they didn't have any maps to choose from. I asked a few of them how they would find out if they should buy some books. I asked them how they could make some observations if I wanted to study astronomy. Then we gathered the materials we needed. We went to the local college to check out a bunch of books on astronomy. It was really fun to see how they all went about their experiments.","Amateur Astronomy was started in 1899 in a small school. They sold a telescope to a neighbor and started doing it later. Theirs was broken down into sections. After a number of astronomical experiments, the next thing they looked out for were other people's observations. The best pictures had been obtained from a variety of sources and from a horde of amateurs. Since the boom of the telescopes and equipment from 1899 through to 1910, most amateur astronomy went into use by 1931. After 30 years, amateur astronomy was developed. This includes an interest in reading scientific literature, computer science, and mathematical theories. It was in the early 60's that astronomy became a widespread practice. Today amateur Astronomy is an essential part of astronomy today."
C2,"Art is an art movement. Art is an art movement in the USA where art is popular. It takes a lot to show people how much art can be appreciated. But when it comes to art, the only thing is art. So, the art movement has become a movement that seems to be the only way to show an art. In today's world, that word is nothing more than art. Art is a medium that can be used for cultural purposes. It is not in the arts. It is not in the sciences. You can see this with the world's first edition of ""Art: The Artist's Work and Cultures in 50 Years."" I want to encourage everyone that I know and like to show their support. So, when I got my first edition, art was being lauded as a revolutionary movement. But, it is not just art. Art is being seen as revolutionary revolutionary and shocking - and not just as a revolutionary movement. Now, we feel good about admiring art that was once known to those who considered art their own. So, the artist's work is always praised as being unique and revolutionary and shocking even.","When we first met David, one of the members of the class had a special art class for the class. David showed us how a variety of different objects he made were carved using tools and techniques. The art class helped me understand that they were created in the spirit of nature. In the beginning, it was an experiment. At first, David wanted to paint a painting but his mind was too full to paint. He then noticed that his hand was touching the stone, and it made his hands appear much thinner. He tried to fix the stone. David felt this was too strong. Eventually, after looking at it for twenty minutes, he had to make some adjustments. However, his hands were still perfectly carved. But he found that he was not satisfied with the result. So, David went to art school, and a few years later he was a master of his art. His paintings were very distinctive. We admired him very much, and we felt good about admiring his work. He was known as one of the greatest art teachers in the world.","We think art is still one of the most important things if we look at it. In the United States in fact we all have the most important things to consider about art, and all it takes to have it is time. But art in its own right is also very important for all of us. In contemporary art, the world of art is just not as important as before, and we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. We want everyone to know that art isn't something like art when it was invented about 500 years ago.","Art is an art form that has moved rapidly down from ancient times. This art is the most creative art form in modern times – so let's have art in that sense. The art of the artist is just like art in some ways. The best piece of art is a piece of art that has been painted in bronze for three hundred years. This artist's work, especially this artist's work, no one was impressed a hundred years ago – a masterpiece. As his work became rare, he had to stop using copper nails to produce his art. In fact, since his first piece of art was about 12 inches long, his body had to be painted over the entire length of his life – making his creation one of the most memorable of the life. In the past, he had had his own style, but eventually he had it thrown out. He used this style to create unique images based on life's experiences and reactions. We feel good about admiring the artist's work that no one else has ever seen before.","It’s about time we took an artistic leap into the future. Then it happened. A woman was admonished for painting and then she asked her fellow artists for help. Rather than complain about the paintings she sat down with her friends and listened. They got creative with the ideas they had in mind. Then a few days later, we finally decided to let go. My friends noticed that I had something to do with my art. My art was unique! So I was quite surprised. Then the artist rediscovered it and brought us home. She gave us a little present. I hope that they have been influenced by her.","By contrast to the art of his contemporaries, art now is regarded as more unique and revolutionary than in the past. While the art of his contemporaries was considered most creative, artists are now considered renowned at a much higher level. Art is praised by experts at art schools and other schools and institutions of higher learning and art education alike. Students of all styles and skill levels enjoy learning the artists' art. With this in mind, it is good to see art being regarded as more original and unique than in the past. This is the message behind our new art movement.","A family is having a picnic in the garden. It's the sun in the morning and it will be cold. We are doing our homework and think of an artist who has come up with a unique work. In this story, there are a few examples. One is a girl, whom we know she loves. Another is a dog, the squatter who lives in the trees. These young women try to keep up the conversation about art. This art is often very strange to us, sometimes it appears unusual. The writer thinks that it's a coincidence, but there is little scientific evidence that it is. Art is praised in terms of being unique, revolutionary, shocking even, art. One example is the man in the tree, whose hand makes a hole in his shoulder. We are happy about our admiration of the artist."

Nowadays fashion is widely seen as a modern phenomenon. But in modern times, it has been largely dependent on capitalism. Many historians have criticized fashion for its lack of a long history. Many historians of fashion have criticized fashion for the development of styles. Many historians of fashion regard fashion as a ""new art"". Most historians of fashion look at the rise of the markets and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as evidence of fashion's long history. Because of this, most historians of fashion are looking to give fashion much more than only about a few decades. Some historians of fashion think fashion is as a more important topic today than modern capitalism.","Designers are seen as a modern phenomenon largely because of the rise of the market and mercantile trade. Most historical scholars who view fashion as having an entirely modern sense of style say that fashion is a modern phenomenon. Some historians also feel that fashion is a very old concept.

Many historians of fashion believe that the market had developed around fashion that would have been a major factor in its development. But it wasn’t until the Renaissance that fashion emerged.,"Fashion was a big part of European architecture throughout Europe and Europe. The market economy of the 1800s dominated the market place with its creations as large as 16,000 square feet or 30,000 people. Modern designer labels were first used in Europe and America. The rise of the market economy in the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe and the United States put fashion at a strategic starting point. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out though that fashion at least in the sense of style and design has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point.","Fashion was an early business and design movement that flourished from its early establishment in the mid 17th century through its early days. The business itself was built around men, women and children. They were all connected through trade and marketing. Fashion evolved from its original business roots, which started in the 1920s through the early 18th century. The world expanded, becoming a globalized market, but it was only until the 1960s that the economy and fashion was developed into a powerful market. The modern fashion industry dominated the industry in the 1960s and the early 1970s. The decline of the manufacturing industry led to the creation of a new market where men made more money and made sales. During the 1870s, women began working at large factory factories for goods and became independent fashion. This pushed them to the forefront in a market they pushed their way into the 21st century. Many modern fashion organizations are dedicated to the fashion industry despite its history. Fashion's history dates back over a century and a half century, and most historians are at pains to point out the time period, especially the rise of the market and mercantile trade during the 1880s. Fashions have a long history. The 20th century, the 1920s, and the 1980s are the earliest in fashion history."
C2,"The Pebble in the Stone Age would have been a bright pink lily. It was a small gold ring which was only slightly different from the one seen by our modern visitors. After some research, it was found that there were no stones on the edge of the river. Our early ancestors were very different. Apparently the pebble came from Europe.","A stone age lady and her hermit ate her goldfish. After she snatched it, she took it to her room. She began rubbing a mixture of goldfish and copper in the bedroom and kept waiting in the basement for a meal. After they were fed up, she let them all in. She wondered what could have caused this. The man gave her a small, single pebble. She asked him what it was made of and he responded that it was made of minerals. As she looked at the pebble, the man looked at her and said, ""What do you say?"" She snatched it off the bed. The woman didn't even say anything, she just stepped in the sink. The stone age woman asked, ""Why did you put it in here?"" and the man tripped over her head. The woman tripped over her head and fell into the water. She started to ached. The man looked at her and decided to throw the pebble off the bed. She tried so hard to slap it back into the water but the pebble didn't stick to the bed. A dog jumped through the pebble and swam into it. She tripped over a huge hole in the rock and lost it, leaving a pebble behind. The man then tried to grab the pebble, but the piercing wound her ribs and her arm and it still attached. As she stepped in the water, the man flipped the pebble and stepped back into the river. The man was shocked to find it was only a pebble and the man just did not want to swallow it. This made the person so scared that he walked right up to her and screamed. She said, ""Here!""","They viewed metals with fascination. They looked for something that a modern modern human wanted to look at with a slightly different perspective. Now they seem more interested in gold, diamonds, and sand. But we now know that people have a fascination with metals in common with us. So it is no surprise that this year was marked by a huge celebration for them.","The stone age people at that time were very fond of the use of metals. They were able to manipulate them to their own physical desires as a way of expressing themselves. One of the characteristics of Stone Age people was that the pebble shook the water in such a way that the water was no longer moving. Their goal was to make something of themselves in the same way that the tides swept the Earth. They wanted to make something of themselves, which they did.","Stone Age people enjoyed wearing silver, gold and bronze sculptures during the Stone Age. They were also interested in emeralds, shale and brass in the later Bronze Age. A large number of people found their way through to the modern Stone Age and are learning how to emerald or find their way through the shale and brass in the early Bronze Age.","Stone Age people didn't have a lot of time to think about the day they'd gotten these slivers of metal. Then they realized that it would be tough to find them in old times. So they made a wish for themselves to find those slivers.

C2,A professor asked me to take some pictures of the city. While there he took some pictures of some of the nightclubs in town. Then the professor said he must do an assignment for a famous photographer. I decided not to do the assignment and went home. This was the time I was in Vienna to take photographs.,I took a photo of my family visiting Vienna. It was a great way to see Vienna. My boyfriend took pictures of her family and her pets. He showed her a framed photograph of her family and their pets. I couldn't believe how wonderful it was!,I went to Vienna when I was a student. It was sunny on a Friday afternoon. I took a lot of photos. I didn't know how to take a picture until about 7:20 in the morning. Then it was dark in the evening. I didn't know how to take a picture for a lecture or a movie. I couldn't get enough of Vienna. The Vienna assignment was a great opportunity for me.,I was at the airport in Vienna to take pictures. I wanted to take photos. So I set off to Vienna. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. I made a surprise appointment.,"I was a teenager. I attended a senior photography convention in Vienna, Austria. I began to look at my photography on a microscope. I took photos of people in front of a screen and from inside a window. When my parents sat down and began to make eye contact, my imagination had a heightened quality. I was excited to be in Vienna as a photographer and I spent a lot of time enjoying the sights.",I was in Vienna to take photographs. I went to Vienna to study. I had been to Vienna and liked Vienna. I was happy because I like Vienna and it was part of my life. It was a nice thing that Vienna is the capital of Germany.,"A friend suggested that I take a photo of Vienna when I was in Vienna. I had a free time to shoot something interesting. I stayed in Vienna a few times and viewed many beautiful shots. It's a good place to see a city, though.

C2,"I had always been an insomniac. I woke up every morning so it would be a good time to rest my mind. After reading all the latest research in the US about how much people sleep with slumber, I thought I'd give it a try. I did. Now I'm a good insomniac. I know that sleep can be stressful and even scary, but I know it's never going to stop me from doing something so sloppy. Especially when the day after school is over and you're too busy and stressed to make time for anything. So I woke to learn that I should be sleeping but I'm so tired that I can't stay up. I don't even need that to get me to have a good night's rest. Then you get to know that insomnia is a disease that has been plagued by insomnia in the past. It has started to change with the average person focusing on one night every day, just like some sleep-research laboratories. I now realize it's a daily experience. That's the kind of thing that makes us do things differently in our lives. As I got more comfortable in the world of novels, I realized how important they are for us to be awake. I sat up and thought: It's going to be good. So now I know that I can sleep better. I also know that I'm in love with women in life, but I don't know who will change my life. Then I slept better. I felt like I could take a break from the world but then I realized I really needed to. Getting up early to sleep helps to control fatigue and boost my mood and that's exactly what I did. When I went back to bed to get a rest, I felt refreshed and refreshed. I also found that I was healthy and content. I started to practice mindfulness and meditation. This is part of my training. I hope that I make changes in the time lapse I have in the future.","When I read my second novel about the modern sleeping disorder I was worried about what I might be seeing. The next day I had a very unusual experience. The first thing to do is to start to relax. I spent the day listening to strange stories of people getting sick or not getting enough sleep. When I woke up the next morning I was so worried and anxious about the future that I slept more like a fool. What are dreams? The first reason is that dreams help us get a good night's rest. When you have an amazing dream, it's a fantastic idea to dream about something you dream about. Dreams may come true after sleep but most dreams lead to dreams. When a dream comes true, dreams come true. To achieve these dreams, all you have to do is scream. Dreams do not come true to anyone. When a dream comes true, you have to believe it. If your dream is real, you have to believe that it will come true. As time passes, dreams begin to become reality. When dreams begin to start appearing real people start to dream about something different or become real. A dream can occur but only when it is real, it happens to a really real person. You know, your dream is actually not real. You can't believe anything if you know what you are doing, it's not possible to change anything, and there's no such thing as truth. To make matters worse, dreams start turning into reality. It is hard to believe that your dream will actually be true when you have a true story to tell. I just want to remind you that even dreams are true. When you see these dreams, you may wish that you did not believe them! I want to remind you that even dreams are fact and it has nothing to do with their physical appearance and their motivation. It has nothing to do with the fact that you are alive.",The young man's problems in the school were all solved when he spent a night alone in the library reading his favourite novel on the computer. His professor recommended his novel and he was pleased. He told their students that many books on the subject - such as Sleeping Beauty - had a long wait before he published it. Many textbooks in the main subject subjects were reprinted to give them an edge. But their book was a bit chubbier and lacked the wit and aplomb that his novel required. So his professor ordered him to write his novel to save money. They also asked him to help him decide what the best book to read. They found that their work was worth more than what they spent. But they are still concerned about the health and wellbeing of their patients and their families because patients have been having unusual problems - such as depression and anxiety - and that he had to go to the hospital. So he waited patiently at night in his bed to wake up and be given enough sleep to last a few hours. The doctor gave him a small pill that he could give to the patients he was writing his novel. His son listened and told him the best book to read. Then he listened to his mother talk and he told his parents that his son was suffering from sleeplessness. While his parents were busy their kids were having schoolwork on their own. They were taking the baby to a hospital for testing their fears about a dangerous place. Then the doctors told him that the best-selling novel in Britain was Sleeping Beauty by Julia Roberts. It ended up being a hit with the readers when they came home to relax. The son was very happy that he had finally started reading the book.,"The writer's first novel, 'The Twilight Saga', was published by HarperCollins in 2000. During the novel series, his main characters often got in trouble and often were called in for a routine. They were often treated as insanity by an inmate who made them feel guilty. This novel would be one of his favorite series. The plotline featured a woman who was being tortured for three hours at a time with a knife but could only sleep five minutes at a time. After the first night, she found that she was struggling with sleeping, her friends told her to go to a physiotherapy center. While in the hospital, she was forced to take the hospital's ER because she felt as if she was unresponsive. She screamed in pain and was hospitalized for four days. However the next day, she was again disturbed and suffered from the anxiety. She was then admitted to the hospital. Her mother was diagnosed as being unwell from the night and was given the last shot at having to go to a ER - her mother was hospitalized and the nurse a year later was unwell. The doctors wanted her to get a resuscitation, but she went on to have a successful life as a psychologist. She suffered from a sleep disorder, also known as chronic fatigue, as well as hyperventilation or extreme fatigue. She had to endure the nightmares and hallucinations of her life and she also had to endure the difficulties of taking her life into account. She also had to cope with the stress of work and family life. Her illness was the result of many conditions.","This book is about incontinence. As a child I suffered from excessive use of sleep. I'd dream of being a teenager. I couldn't sleep, I'd be in the middle of doing homework. And I'd not wake up in the morning. I just woke up in the afternoon. I was trying to catch up on a couple of stories about insomnia. But I couldn't get enough. Then I'd had too much of it! My imagination kicked in. This is the second-worst period of my life. I could imagine why: I didn't get enough sleep to go to bed to do homework. I started to get the worst grade: a A. Whichever grade your grades are in I think it is worth taking it seriously. I know that the first grade is hard for me, but my parents wanted me to take a look at something and take a break, but we had too much energy left, so I stayed up the whole day. I had a bad grade as a teenager. I hate to be the one to tell you, but I wanted to get better. My parents were also concerned about my health. They wanted to see me if I could get enough sleep, but they could've given me a lot more. My family was worried about me because of my anxiety and depression. Then I looked at a newspaper and found one article about an insomniac who worked at a lab. And now it was in a book that is featured in many books in the UK. And a British novel called The Psyche had a book about incontinence. All this was a book about insomnia, so in the UK I thought it would be good to try something new. It also featured in an American novel about insomniacs, which is very well-known in Britain. This was a fantastic book. I can't wait to read it!","As an adult, I enjoy sleeping very little. I enjoy seeing books about stories, movies, music, animals, and books that make me sleep well. I am a little sleepy too. So I thought it would help to have a good book about sleep. To make matters worse, I did not know how I was feeling until the last book. I was looking forward to reading the next book. So I decided to ask my therapist. This book is called ""The Sleeper"". The therapist reveals the story of a girl who works at a hospital in a night shift. The nurse tells the story in a flashback, so the therapist asks her how they are feeling. The therapist describes her life and her struggles with sleep. The therapist says she has to sleep and that the therapist must help her. The therapist concludes that people who sleep often are not normal people. The therapist asks her how she is feeling and asks her whether or not she should have a good sleep. Then, the therapist takes up the matter with her and lets her sleep in the stall. The therapist says the story is great. She goes off to bed and is able to sleep at night. She is happy and relaxed. The therapist says that she should get up early and go to sleep. She goes to sleep and is not happy. During sleep, she is awakened by the nurse's answers and starts crying. Then her throat is so sore that a new sound starts to occur at the start of the story. The therapist is then able to see what has happened. This book is great, and a lot of good ideas have been made about insomniacs.","When you see the American people in many of the best novels, you want to find out what happens. The American Psyche has become a very fast paced society in which many people are having a hard time getting enough sleep. This article will show you a number of symptoms you are in the early stages of sleep. There are a variety of causes for insomnia, but most sleep disorders occur first. There are two categories of insomnia, though one is chronic and another is persistent. The first group of insomniacs in the novel are insomniacs. The second category is insomniacs which are people who have problems sleeping. The three types of sleep disorder mainly rely on this type of stress, which usually causes them to sleep harder than usual or in the evening."
C2,"Cannons Gym is a popular lunch-time hangout for City of London workers. So much so that, at a quiet time, the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. The centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning because it is an outdoor gym that gets the most heat out of the prevailing 0 degrees Fahrenheit. There are nine different classes in the fitness centre - from cardio & strength to stretching. The gym consists of five studios, three music rooms, two cafes and a library. So much so that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic.","Cannons Gym is a favourite lunch-time place for City of London workers. They're located in a city centre, just east of West Bromwich Albion. But they're not the only ones in the city that enjoy the exercise. They are also popular with locals who like to keep in touch with their neighbours. This summer's temperature has been unusually high at Cannons Gym. With the current high temps and chill in the air, it's going overboard to keep the area cool.","It is in the city centre. But there is no air conditioning, there are no windows and no air-conditioning. The staff is at Cannons Gym to deal with this summer's unusually high temperatures. They are happy to be with me!",Cannons Gym was just being constructed over the summer holidays in the borough of London. It has to be the hottest in the city. Now staff are trying to deal with the chilly air through the windows and the high speed treadmills. The gym is the only reason to go.,"It was a hot summer day and everyone in the fitness centre wanted to do something about it. The club refused the gym’s offer and now they are spending lots of money to get it wrong. The fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning in the gym. At low speeds, the gym’s equipment is used to turn on the air-conditioning in front of the building’s customers. The gym has the option to set it to “off” at various times of day with each other, and the building itself was initially fitted to a high-height temperature setting. However, now that the gym is up and running with their cooling system, it is a good sign that their fitness centre has gone overboard on their heating. The gym is also offering free indoor pool access. Fortunately, this summer’s weather is starting to show up when temperatures are above freezing, which means that the gym’s equipment is cold again.","Cannons Gym is a gym, and its employees love it. But it’s not really a fitness center or an ice cream shop. Instead, it’s an exercise room or club. A chill in the air, with people playing in a hot pool or a gym full of other people. Unlike gyms, this location only uses indoor air-conditioning. This is because people often spend an hour or two in the gym, meaning when they get home, they are all too relaxed. At other time of day, people will probably use the gyms heating system because it is a noisy place. At this time of day it’s cool, so people feel less anxious and healthier. Cannons Gym is a fitness club, but it has an indoor indoor store. Workers are not joking about where the gym is. Cannons Gym was once popular in the city as a gym. The air-conditioning and the cooling make it feel like somewhere in the Arctic. At quiet times it feels like somewhere in the Arctic.","The indoor heat is high, and the temperature is average at Cannons Gym. But to get warm up in the mornings and evenings you have to make sure you have the proper air-conditioning. So this winter a number of gyms have been set up to tackle that problem. The first one, in the park, is a heated outdoor gym. It has got a fan on the front. By the evening, the temperature has reached the freezing point, and it doesn't matter. The temperature now drops to the coolest point in the world. So it's cold outside, too."
C2,I was trying to find the best way to see stars in the night sky. I was looking out the window but was trapped by a light beam. I had read somewhere that if the day was clear it would cause dark clouds to fall. I gave up and went back outside.,"The weather was fine at the time of the story so I got out of there early and took the long walk to the cave. I saw several stars but I couldn't see many of them, so I decided to climb out from above. We climbed out and saw a good deal of the cave. But we were really hoping for the best because the clouds had cleared. But the sky was clear and as I climbed in, a strange light began to fall. After a moment the dark glare began to disappear. I climbed up the ladder and climbed out of there.","During a blizzard a gull approached from deep below. I approached carefully to check the surface. The gull shook me loose, so i swung it back over the edge, and fell. A little further, the gull was still there and it was quite strong, which kept me going. I went down a stepsister and picked up the gull's horn. I swung it to the top a few feet below and took a deep breath.",I wanted to see the stars out of the earth. I asked you to help me with my scheme and you were all right.I would be very happy to help.,"My teacher offered me a place to stay at a rock house with my friends. I parked it near a wall and climbed in. My teacher was excited when I opened the window and lowered it on the wall. My classmates asked me if I could use the rockhouse. I guessed, you can see stars if the light from the well was visible from above. This is an A2-aay lesson in natural environment science.",I had seen a star in the sky before on a rainy day. The clouds were falling behind me. I heard the sound of the well float over my head. It sounded like a strangely shaped glass. I got up and looked at the stars.,"When my friend was visiting for her birthday, we were not allowed to see. Now it was sunny, and I needed to have a nice umbrella. We climbed into the well bucket and then climbed in. I tried to make my idea look like something you could see with a bottle of wine. My friend pointed the bucket at me, pointed out its spot, and pressed it into the wall."
C2,Ralph was young and eager to be an owner. When he got older he had to move to a bigger apartment. Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark motionless hall he was besieged and sometimes barely besieged. He was never able to be away so often due to his innate ability to read sight.,"Ralph was a house maid, but his friend, Mary, had a large estate. Mary needed to stay after her wedding, but Ralph couldn't afford the rent so she paid Ralph a little money. Mary took care of Ralph, and he returned alone at the end of the day. The three years have been a rough one for Ralph. The day before Ralph left, Mary looked for him and saw him looking very different. Ralph saw her hiding behind the gate and looked at her when he got out of the room. She looked very sad and thought that Ralph only came to him on his own after her wedding. Mary told Ralph that the time of day she would leave was to make him available to buy her a new house. Mary knew the man who had been waiting for a long time. But when Ralph finally arrived home one day, Mary showed her the new home. Mary wanted Ralph to go, but Ralph refused. Mary sent Ralph to the house to return the house. When she showed her the house, Ralph saw that Mary had thrown up. Mary wanted to go to the house and give Ralph an inheritance for him. She tried to find someone willing to keep her and offered to bring a home. The house was never found. The new house has a bright red tv, and Mary thinks of Ralph as a servant. Mary tries to be a neighbour to Ralph, but Ralph goes to Mary's house a little closer to where she lives.","Ralph owned a home on Main Street for three years. He went on a long quest to acquire a large enough lot and in search of some land. One day he was told he would not be able to get it for an extended period of time. Among the properties he could look at was a house with three different kinds of wood. Then he discovered that the house was a home that could still be used to make some basic money. He went on to buy many things. When he was asked about the land, Ralph asked about it. He discovered that it had been recently renovated. It looked great and seemed a wonderful home. But Ralph had no other property that he could live in. He couldn't see the house, but thought of it as the place to stay. Thankfully he found the place when he could.","Ralph had been staying at the townhouse for three years and the house was full of hay. One night Ralph went back to school and after the first day he realized he still had a lot of possession. He put the house in a small shed and had a great time. However, after a traumatic day he decided to put up with the loneliness. While he was at the hostel he found out that other people were trapped inside. He sat on his bed, kept his locked doors from the outside world and was greeted by friends who wanted to see him. As he entered the dark motionless hall and went to bed he felt a momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day.","Ralph began a relationship with Alice. He was a poor housekeeper in the neighborhood. She took him to a veterinarian when he contracted tuberculosis and had no food to eat. As time went on, Ralph came under the scrutiny of a police police inspector. He escaped without a single trace of disease. His neighbors were concerned that he had no reason for being in the area. He escaped without charges because he had been detained. In his absence, he had been re-united with his friends who was having a party with them.","Ralph went to school on Thursday, leaving his parents. He came up to school after his dad left. On the day of the new semester, his parents went out on a date, asking Ralph for a meal. Ralph left before the dinner date so they could go for a night trip. During the day, Ralph sat down by himself in his apartment and ate breakfast. At night, he got dressed and went to sleep. He came downstairs in his bedroom and sat there, staring out the window. When he came back to his room, he saw a dark, motionless hall reflected in the dark. At the end of the day, he walked out of his bedroom, making his way back into his apartment.","It was very warm in the hall at the end of the day and it was a nice weather but there were still clouds covering the hall. We saw it was not a very well liked place in the house as well. I believe we had a bad light coming in from the outbuilding. Ralph had two resentful children and they had to leave home unoccupied when they left the house. Ralph took three months of vacation for his health and thought it was a good reason to move into the small place in his garden. He walked away from the ground despite it being in the dark and dark. He looked at the house as if it were his own. However he found out the old house was in a very good shape. He had one bedroom and it looked good and very well stayed. He looked to his other roommate, who had been there for three years, as if he had gone into the hall. He started to hear his neighbor yelling for them to come in but they were too far away to hear. He was very anxious as he left but did not leave for a long while. He was very upset he had to walk to find the place to stay. He had gone to a bookshop at the town library to ask for a book. His neighbours were not so sure who owned the house. Ralph didn't have much time to talk to him and just stared at what was around him. This made Ralph feel like he had to ask for money from his neighbours. He felt like he had no other choice but to stay in the area. The neighbours did not give a damn about the place."
C2,"My family is a big family, so their children grow up a lot. They live in big houses, but still, you are able to be close to them everyday. In the past the children had grown up in those big houses. Sometimes parents were very nice, but sometimes you had to stay with them. You were the most important person in their lives. As a small child, you could be close to their grandchildren, but you were a grandparent. Now my mum thinks they have a real sense of responsibility for their lives, and you can find them very easily on the internet. There are so many ways to connect with them, and you can connect them to people who are interested in their heritage, not necessarily their spouse.","At this particular moment in history, there are many things that can have a significant impact on our lives. There is also cultural and history. Whether we are in the past or in the present, we still have our history. Heritage is a good source of information. Heritage is something that gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection to the past. There are no myths about the past, but our sense of connection is very strong. Cultural heritage means that people and communities can connect with the past.",Some people rely on their own words and stories to describe who they were. These words show people the past. One example is when a neoclassical man named Robert H. Heeney took one man to a cemetery where there were some settlers from. It made him feel very nostalgic. Other people thought his words were a waste of time and were not true. Then the man remarked that he thought he was the owner of his own heritage.,"I have my grandparents coming into town for a wedding. They used to go to the wedding to look for a wedding gown. I have no knowledge about how that wedding lasted and I don't have much knowledge about weddings. However, my grandparents have always been there and they are still part of the wedding party. Therefore, they have no idea where they have been as people feel connected with their heritage. In fact, their families do not have a good connection or the people around them never know. That is the reason that people feel connected to their heritage. For example, in the past, family has always referred to their family as their own. The people who are still alive today don't usually ask others for some kind of explanation of the story.",An old man in a hat and a hat went to a market to buy a new hat for his wife. He decided to bring his hat and make the hat out of old black cotton. It was a success and he was happy to bring his new hat back to his wife after many years of looking after him.,"Several years ago, I was playing with a friend and I realized that I wanted to make a story for him. I'm proud of my father and I'd like to be a part of this. Our aunt came to see and saw me. Then I talked about heritage and I'd said, ""When I'm doing something my personal heritage is our special gift."" I wanted to tell the story because I had never seen anyone else doing that in their lives before. My aunt told me that people have a real connection with their personal heritage. They have the same experience as my grandmother. I gave a talk and got some answers from people about my grandmother's heritage and the things they were like. My friend told me that this family lived a very special and rich family that lived in the past. I knew her to be a very special person.",One day I had a birthday party and we were asked to come have a drink. Our parents had told us there would be no glass at our table since it was cold outside. We were surprised but the weather was very cool and people were able to enjoy their family time. We also found out that there were a few people of color at our party and many of them were from other places too. The reason we could go was because we knew where we were going and were allowed to have a drink. In our party we had the usual party members and guests. People enjoyed drinks so we had to go to the restaurant for dinner. Some people commented that they were having the best time.
C2,"Whenever I wanted a review from a professional acting artist, I went to Stratford Playhouse. I resigned from the stage and was saddened to see Ray Fearon’s character take away from me from their performance. However, my colleague asked me how to do something about it. As he was very young and talented, Ray felt his performance was as good as my own. He was on a roll as well, so I would like to thank him for his dedication to his career. Othello, however, was the worst theater performance of Shakespeare’s classic play, and I got my money’s worth. I had complained that Stratford played a bad role in it, but it has changed now. My colleague was so relieved when he had given Stratford a better review. His feedback is great. This time I am pleased with the results and will return to Stratford.","A group of friends saw a performance of the play that I was telling my story about last week. We were not expecting the performance that I wrote. We were excited as I thought that it would be a stellar performance. I’d never seen Ray Fearon before. I asked why that was. He had to go back and get the performance. His acting talent was amazing as he had so much potential. Our group was surprised at the performance. I could tell that he was more of an actor, and I knew that he had a good cast. It’s a lot easier than it would have been for me to write the review. I couldn’t figure out what caused the criticism. I was a bit disappointed. My friends thought I’d run out of words. They didn’t know how to say ’I”m sorry. But luckily, the play was a success. We made our own mistakes, focusing on characters that are a little older than we expected and making mistakes. My fellow classmates were very happy with the production, which is a great success.","In the early days of English drama, there were a lot of stereotypes of different Shakespeare plays. On the big screen, there was a lot of nudity and violence that was typical of Shakespeare plays. So after the stage erroneously started taking its turn, the writers realized that the audience was not as educated as they ought to be. However, the play became more and more inaccessible and I felt it was a good opportunity to develop new ideas for characters that may not have been there before. This is why I am glad that my review was so positive and the theatre gave a real sense of community.","Ray Fearon’s first role as Othello came to light, but his role as Stratford’s harlot was largely overlooked. The show opened last spring from Stratford Theatre’s Stratford Opera House, which is not a theater that is actually used by Shakespeare. A young audience of adults, including children and adults, is expected to see Othello – and fear the production to have a poor cast. Ray’s play is one of many that has been given a terrific performance by Stratford and London Shakespeare’s leading man, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Stratford’s performance is spooky, with actors often wearing costumes, attempting to be a musical as one would have liked. It is an extraordinary production with such a great cast and a very well-balanced cast. The production, like the one I had seen the production in at Stratford, was well-acted, with a well-paced script, with impressive lighting, and very well-dressed dreaded faces. This was Stratford’s best, and the production is a joy to watch.","There is a new production of Othello going on in London. Before the production was over, they had told me how much I was proud to say, since I always did the same thing. The last time I saw it I was amazed! This time, it wasn’t. Now, it was amazing. The play I wrote about, however, was based on the play Othello by Shakespeare. I was not sure if I should take the criticism lightly or leave it entirely to Ray Fearon. Now this production is much more accurate. I'm not sure the critics will know how the play was written, but they should. So I'll make amends for the criticism, if I like, and let them know you are proud of this production of the play.","John got to watch a new production of Shakespeare’s play, Othello. Its a production of a Shakespeare play written in the Middle Ages. However, the production of Shakespeare’s play, Othello has never been adapted for theatre. On the day of the transfer, John complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. Ray decided to not act in it and I thought it was not a bad idea to use Ray Fearon’s acting to do a small role. John made good on his complaint and tried to reassure people of the fact that he wasn’t a good actor. Later, John got the opportunity to be on a stage to play the title role. This means he gets a bigger role. John was given the opportunity to win the stage, but didn’t win. John won the stage, and a small portion of the audience got a big part in the whole thing. The play is also Shakespeare’s drama, but it was more visually exciting and fun. The stage performance is a good example of that – it was a good way to spend the evening.","A review on a play called Othello, a Shakespeare adaptation of Shakespeare’s play about a young boy and a boy's love, caused me to write what was wrong. I was angry that the cast chose not to be part of the play, and I thought that I would run around looking for more material. I wrote on Othello but it was taken down by the director, Ray Fearon. I was angry that fearon was not given time to act. On the day of the show, Ray felt that his acting was terrible and wasn’t worth the money he was paying to make him the head of the production. He was inexplicably attracted to the play and fought a fight, so he had to go to London to give him time. At the end of the play, the theatre got a new stage and all three actors started performing together. I wrote in front of the critics in English that his performance was good but I think he was more talented than he is now."

C2,"Interested in Mars exploration or launching a landing capsule on Mars but unsure of whether to apply? This is the first time the couple have stepped on the Mars space station. Located on the surface of the moon in orbit, the Martian capsule will be a round trip to Mars. In a way, the two astronauts must be physically and emotionally robust enough to do so. They must be physically and emotionally robust enough to take their 501 days to the Mars station. In addition, the two applicants must be physically and emotionally robust in order to be qualified to do so. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. For the past 16 years, people have been applying for the Martian space station because it is a permanent mission to Mars.","Two middle-aged married couples were trying to plan a round trip to Mars for the first time. They decided to sign up and work together from a distance. After a long day of driving, they picked up their cell phones, headed to the docks, and prepared for an exciting adventure. They spent a week in the space and had the good fortune to re-enter the space race before the launch of the new space capsule. While doing so, they discovered it was difficult to travel through space and that there was little chance of getting to Mars after all. The Mars trip was a dream come true. How was the teen group able to survive the trip? The couple had no clue. As they approached the Mars landing site, they were surprised to see the plane landed. It had been five months since they would see the spacecraft launch. The mission will likely go well.","The couple’s dream has come true. They are interested in sending a couple for a round trip to Mars on 5 January 2018. The two were married in 2017 and have never visited earth. On their way to Mars, they had to fly to the planet of Saturn as a married couple. The couple made the trip as a special offer to travel to Mars. Interested parties must be physically and emotionally robust. Interested parties should arrive at the location indicated in the application packet and will undergo medical and psychological evaluation. Those who applied may not be allowed to take part in the Mars mission. The couple were in desperate need of a second-hand experience to visit Mars. We asked the candidates to provide information about their experiences. We chose to offer a pilots and engineers. The cost was a lot, but they were able to provide the necessary experience. However, the couple’s desire to travel was not entirely for them. It required substantial funding and a great deal of hard work. However, they can’t afford to miss the chance of joining Mars. Applicants are also obligated to obey the laws of nature and will be given a long, detailed training in how to travel and fly to Mars on a regular basis. Aside from the perks that a 501-day round trip cost, this is a great opportunity for a first-time Martian astronaut to come to a conclusion.","A young couple had just come to Mars and decided they would go back home. Their spouse was going to go on a trip and they needed space with friends. That night, they planned their trip to Mars. When the first guests arrived, it was a 501-day round trip to Mars. The two couples were looking for space for a few days. The couples need to be physically and emotionally robust before they can go on a trip on the trip. They also need to be fit to carry their own bags on the trip. The Mars journey was planned to take up to four weeks. The astronauts have taken the spaceship from earth to Mars, where their first visit is scheduled for next week. They have been married since 1998 and have a two year old son with them. The astronauts are now married and have kids. They are excited to go to Mars but would hate to get married. In addition, their new marriage will include being on another spaceship to Mars. All applications must be made using personal and business information. The selected couple must be physically and emotionally robust and capable of making decisions about the journey. They have the option of staying on the trip for longer than 501 days. The applicant must be physically and emotionally robust and be able to face pressure. They will be asked to leave their mobile phones out, phone chargers in their car, and a personal check on their home. They must also be able to travel and be at a very convenient place for a brief medical checkup and post-mortem checks, such as the Mars Visitor Center. A visit to Mars could lead to a large reward for space travel, such as a small prize of over US$10,000. They must also find ways to take part in the spaceship to Earth for some time. If the crew agrees, a full life will be aboard the spaceship. The couple will also spend a day on the station, along with the astronauts.","This month, you might be able to rent an apartment from the Martian space agency and land for the first time. You will be able to get the spacesuit, then leave for your mission with a couple of friends. But you are not allowed to get a chance to meet the astronauts themselves. Besides, Mars is not a safe place. The space agency says its crew, a couple of volunteers and other volunteers will help plan the journey with a trip to Mars. But you do not have to look cool to get there. This year a family is able to take the couple on an exploration trip to Mars. This is a trip that requires no specialized knowledge or equipment, but the couple must have enough time to prepare for the trip. It is important to be physically and emotionally robust as the couple are young, and may have plenty of interest in space if they plan to get the spacesuit. To help their mission, the couple must be physically and emotionally robust. In order to be granted the opportunity to land, applicants must be physically and emotionally robust, both physically and emotionally robust. The purpose of the assignment is to find a spacecraft and provide them with a glimpse into the area. For the time being, both the applicant and the candidate will be living or working on land at the same time, or on different areas. To see a physical part of the trip, the couple must be at least 6 hours ahead of time. The couple has been planning an exploration trip to Mars for over nine months and they want to get the time to get into the area that they will land on. Those two couples would be the first to land on Mars. Their ideal situation is to sleep for a few nights on the beach. This would allow for some time for their personal growth and enjoyment. The couple will be able to work on their Mars project for a few months and then set about getting a chance to explore in space.","The couple who has decided to take a trip to Mars has asked for permission to join. While searching for someone to take them to Mars, a couple had to ask some questions. The couple was told they would have to find the man in the cab. The couple is in a relationship. The couple is married and have children. Hence they have to make some sort of investment. They have to be physically and emotionally robust, though they do not have to be physically or emotionally robust. This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if their plan to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition.","Dennis Tito’s plan to fly his wife and child to Mars had come to an end after his wife and children passed away. However, his husband, Tom, and his wife have been battling with cancer, and have been losing hope for the future. The family and the man have recently turned to the Internet to talk about his marital problems. The wife called her husband to tell him his wife was ill and he has been asking his doctor for a visit to make her feel better.

C2,In Britain waste collections are routinely put in a more formal environment. Most of the time rubbish containing hazardous materials is never taken and is never disposed of. It seems to the public that household rubbish is very much ignored by governments.,"The idea of raking rubbish into the dumpster is a popular solution. Now, it's possible to get rid of all this rubbish after it has left its container inside. The idea of raking rubbish into a container is a very practical solution. There is simply nothing to do about it except to use a container to dump the trash to the dumpster and to throw it away. This is a very green idea. One problem is that a lot of these items aren't allowed to go through landfill sites. One idea is to try and recycle these materials, such as newspapers, magazines or electronic devices. If the materials aren't recycled, they will be sold to landfill sites. Instead, recyclable materials will go into landfill sites which make the recyclable materials much easier to sell.","A couple of families are having their refuse collected from the streets during the week. They are all collecting each bag of rubbish that falls into the lorry. A local council has an ad-hoc procedure to collect all the refuse. Each ad-hoc procedure takes a week or so. However, families want to be sure, this means they should wait for the appropriate time. One ad-hoc procedure consists of disposing the rubbish into a recycle bin. A local council can pick up a small amount of the waste and move it to the city centre. The local community have a task to take care of the refuse: this can be in a different place every day. During this task the refuse is disposed of using special machinery, a waste container or a special lorry, in a timeshare car park, where the public get a chance to look at it. The police and fire the family for a break in.","The American city of Washington uses the term ""compost"" to refer to the collection of trash. It is used in a variety of ways in its everyday life including to curb dumping, collection of landfill material, recycling of hazardous waste, or simply to keep all the people who collect the garbage out of their homes in the area doing their chores. The idea behind the law is that families can pay for each bag of rubbish they produce. However, the government has limited authority to accept trash bags, and the government has limited authority to refuse to collect those rubbish. That means that it cannot collect those bags that are in the homes without paying the families or the landfills for them. Because the people that collect the garbage are generally responsible for their own waste, they do not impose charges for these products on the taxpayer. They are simply asking a citizen to keep their rubbish there.","The municipal refuse collection system in most developed world countries is a system where every rubbish bag is mailed to families. The responsibility of managing the waste and sorting is of the community rather than the government. However, many families are unable to collect their rubbish within a short distance of their place of origin because of a lack of space. For example, a house that had no place of origin would be unable to manage the garbage on their own. As a result, it is a public nuisance to try and gather the rubbish from a street, the tip, by car or by bus.","At one time, garbage collection was being conducted in our backyard. At other times, the municipal refuse collection service was being conducted in the backyard. At other times, the municipal refuse collection service was being conducted in the backyard. The municipal refuse collection service was being conducted in the backyard.",The new family in the town with their little boy got an idea for their house from a gardener. The gardener let their children play and the children have to clean up the mess. Some families did so without paying the council but they did not really consider it very wise. The family was unwilling to give up the home and went on with their work. It was a difficult task to get this kind of work done in such a short amount of time. The council asked the citizens to make sure that all the homes are cleared as this would get any problems. The city council decided to make their own rubbish collection system and make the council's rubbish pile disappear into the bowels and return it to the family.

C2,"An oral history expert who studies what people say because they can find out more about what they say. For more detailed information about a subject, look up a book. Oral evidence tends to be overly personal and may not show the real life. It is often a jarring reminder that in an interview one party is affected by the other.","The current trend of historians relying on oral evidence to document their story is not just bad news, it also presents a lot of problems. When reading a newspaper article, the reporter hears someone say: ""It was interesting. I knew it was going to be a story"". The reporter gets caught up in the story with a friend, so he decides to go back and take his story out with his family. In turn, they share the same story. Then the reporter gets caught up in a story that is not only bad but not quite true. There is a problem for the journalist, especially when it comes to their personal information. Some of the reporters talk about their lives, but most of the interviews aren’t as convincing as the one which they just had. The final part of the story focuses on how they deal with things, not only the facts, but also on the stories.","After a long trial, historians do not often have to debate with those who say differently than the others. They’re worried that the evidence they’re hearing could be interpreted in a biased way. Eventually, a jury finds a person’s testimony to be unbiased. Then, because of the difficulty of deciding what to say, some historians can only agree on what to say.","In the 1950s, American political ideology was prevalent. Many historians drew on personal information about the country to build their arguments. But with newer versions, this information is sometimes questioned and unrevealed for a very long time. By 1939, the U.S. had been undergoing severe economic meltdown. In 1943, a vast majority of America’s citizens were imprisoned in concentration camps. By 1945, the U.S. had a population of 79,000. The country was then devastated by the Great Recession. The government was trying to control what they lacked and resisted an attempt to contain the Soviets. The Soviets decided that they were not ready to cooperate. Their plan was to build a strong, prosperous Soviet country. The Soviet Union and most of Europe had already done so. The Germans had the advantage in that they could talk directly with the Soviets. The Soviets had their own interests. The first major wars were of Germans and Soviets. The second was of Polish and Polish. And the final war had Germans in the Baltic states. Both lands were re-admitted to the Soviet Union. The Soviets had the advantage in that it was easier to talk with the Soviets. The Germans had the advantage in that they could tell about the war. The Russians were allowed to speak of the War. In 1943, Germans invaded Poland and invaded Poland. There were a few Russians on the Polish border. The British and Polish-Americans fought a series of wars. Poland and the Soviets were the enemies. The Germans were able to protect Poland and Czechoslovakia from the Germans. The Soviets ruled much of the war, as did France. France won the war and was finally defeated.","Jeremy Smith is an editor for The New York Times. He speaks at length on a subject of interest to him. He has done his homework for a number of years and found that many of his work is very interesting. He’s been a long time supporter of his ideas on a lot of subjects, including the Holocaust. However, the current lack of knowledge of any topic is growing among the historians and historians will be faced with some hard choices. One common objection is to see only a vague document of the person’s testimony being seen. It’s possible to construct testimony from a few people by different angles. These differ from one another and are very difficult to determine in an hour-and-a-half based on facts. But if you want to keep your opinions consistent it is important to maintain your own opinions. To keep your perspectives in context, it is important to have a clear understanding of what the reader has come to expect in the story.","History historians rely largely on oral evidence to learn about the history of a topic or event. They can not use a computer to study the evidence because it is out of date. There are few alternatives. However, they do have the advantage of using the oral evidence to help them analyze the evidence.","A friend of mine who is a professor at University of Cambridge spoke about his book on human psychology. He was apprehensive about the subject because he only reads it one time. They started talking about it during their discussion. They discussed their own experiences and they also spoke about their own stories. They were sceptical and resolute about their knowledge. They thought about how bad things in their lives might have been if the information about them could help answer questions. But they didn’t try to explain it in terms of what they had in common. What they were arguing about in their arguments and the discussion that followed were different versions of what the experts had been discussing. Each speaker mentioned how their experiences had affected the other. They discussed how their friends and family had lived in similar areas and how their own experiences had affected their lives. They explained how they both lived in the same place. The book has something for everyone and it has an element of surprise. They talked about how the experiences they had in their group were different. They also discussed how the text could influence their own views on human nature. They discussed about what their professors did or did not do in their classes. They talked about how the books were different than their own. Their opinions on human nature changed, based on their views. The other speaker talked about how they both have different views of human life. They also discussed how they all used technology to create their stories."

His secretary looks a bit older. He is sitting on the bus and talking to the students in his office. His secretary looks a lot younger though not as blond as Lancelot. The bus driver walks out of the hotel looking a bit emaciated. He is assuming Lancelot is going to sleep on the bus. He gets up and walks out of the room. He is dressed nicely.,Lancelot drank coffee on his lunch break. His secretary said he took the sugar one hour before and when he returned it was already lukewarm. Lancelot had asked her secretary about taking sugar at school a few months ago. She wanted a different response from the secretary who had already finished making coffee for him before she remembered that he wasn’t expected. Lancelot stepped away from his secretary and disappeared.,"Lancelot had worked hard to make coffee cups from scratch to make more sugar than he could chew. He had worked hard to cook, made more coffee than he could chew, and made more money than anyone else in his life. Lancelot and his secretary never had any trouble making the cup. It was a good day for Lancelot's sanity because the sugar in the cup was taken from his cup. He was very happy because he decided to have the cup for himself.","Lancelot is a vegan and has only one problem. When he was in the hospital, he had to have a special drink of coffee.

C2,Susan was driving back to the home she was staying in. She got home early because her children were having slumber parties. Her husband Fred was trying to find directions to the house when he discovered all of the rubbish. Susan didn’t want to be in the home but was willing to help her when her home was down. He had a few extra seconds to pack all the moving boxes and the boxes. Her children tended to her after she got the papers off. At this point they found no other way to get back to the house after the move.,"Susan had a busy family life because of the children they had to care for. Her eldest child was at home and she went out. Fred and his crew were always very busy, with one exception being in a hurry to get to the van. On the van, Susan saw every distinguishing feature of the house, except the wooden beams which separated the room. Fred rolled the sheet to the back of his van to move him in. Eventually his team was able to move it back in. After Susan and Fred moved in, Fred took control of the household. They then placed the beams in the corner, and the walls were cut short. Susan noticed a huge number of items, including food, books, toys and clothes, as well as the obstructing window. He told them he would be back in 15 minutes and then return to his house. He said that he had been given permission to move the beams, but it was to take a lot of time for his crew to fully pack everything away in the boxes. This was a small thing but he reprimanded her for not moving everything as they had to. So in the morning, she took the beams to the van and turned the lights back on. Leaving the house, she saw a van full of other people standing in the yard, in the middle of their yard. The van had been parked outside the house and Susan walked to the kitchen to look through it, noticing a lot of people inside.","Susan's parents were moving out and Susan's husband was trying to get her married. Susan wanted to be there for her. Susan, her son and daughter were moving out. Her new husband, Fred, offered her a choice: leave or move to another house. Fred offered Susan an alternative, but she could not agree. With all her children growing up and looking very different, Susan now has to choose which house is best. Fred suggested moving to the tiniest part of the village, St. John's Square. Susan offered to move the home. Fred asked Susan what she was looking for and she agreed. They looked at the new home and found it seemed to be good. Susan was concerned to find the family home's old decorations and furnishings and couldn't find them anywhere. The movers were very friendly and the removals men took them to the new home. Fred explained that moving items like newspapers and plastic bags would contaminate all of the household materials on the floor. Susan waited for a job. She had to buy new newspapers and a new house. She took out the boxes, but Fred kept moving them. The movers arrived home to say goodbye to their family. They brought her a birthday cake and went into the basement to check on her family. Fred brought her a book and brought her a picture of some of the family they were removing. He did say that he was ok to leave them behind. He then went over to Susan's house to tell her if she was right. Susan was very excited to see all his tools and equipment and was not disappointed with the job.","Susan’s children were very hesitant about moving into the house. There was no explanation and it was the biggest mistake that she knew she made as she left with her children. Her children were delighted to see her move into her new home and she had the best time with them. However, she was nervous about everything that had been pushed out. When the van arrived on Susan’s doorstep it was immediately apparent the removal man had ripped the house clean. He had ripped everything up and ripped all the decorations off to make it look nicer and she loved all the work he did. When Susan went back to the van to pack everything up, her kids finally started looking at the house but all she could find were stains on the walls and stains on the floor. She had a hard time understanding what would have been done to the wall coverings. She decided she didn’t want to move and put all the boxes she and Fred were removing in the van. Her husband who was cleaning had to move in from a different home when he heard them. Susan looked through the bin of newspapers to see if everything was gone and she decided to give it a go. When a neighbour said, ‘We need movers of Distinction’, Susan walked out of the home and left her children behind in a huge rage. Her daughter was afraid she might get a break when moving in. But, she remained calm. The van rang a bell and we were off to the car. After a few minutes Susan had her children inside and her children were gone. In the end she decided she was leaving her house and was surprised by how much she had done to move. Her children started to cry when her children came out of the van and she found their new home in a very sad state.","Susan had a baby girl and then her children. On her way home, she noticed ‘Removers of Distinction’. Her children were being moved around her new house and it looked like they would move for joy. She had hoped to keep her house and look in the mirror but now has an old cupboard in it. Her new house was still not finished, and her kids saw their very sight. They noticed it was all unfilled.","Susan and Fred bought a used car from Fred a few years ago and they left them at a dealership in their car. Susan was very happy. As they were out walking Susan noticed what was coming and left Fred with a truck with everything that was going to the dealership. There was nothing she could eat in the store but she could feel the excitement as Fred got her kids out and parked at the garage. When she arrived she heard the car ringing and the van parked. Susan was astonished to see how many children were coming and so her son could get her out. There were a few children around at the dealership so Susan called her first. Fred gave her a bag and a key to the dealership. She started shopping at the dealership in the parking lot where the cars and bikes were waiting. Fred then showed the kids the pictures of all the kids, including his little sister that was still in the van. Susan told Fred where she could find all the kids and told him she could buy them from Fred's van. Susan went down to the store and found the car. She called Fred's removal man and a truck driver. Fred pulled over the car and the car went into the garage. His truck was getting rid of the broken part and there was nothing she could do for the day. Fred then gave Susan a big lift out of the garage.","Susan and her husband have two children, who are now grown. When they go down to the move, Susan notices that all these things were being left behind. Her youngest is now in the nursing home, and her oldest is currently in a nursing home. Susan takes her children to her home and places a box in the window. Her children are now home alone. She is excited to find out that everything was moved and that they will be looking at the new house. There has been a couple of years of turmoil between the children and the removal man, so it was a lot of work to do and it took time to make sure that everything was put away. However, Susan decided to go with her children and give them her blessing. Her children had a lot to do with their lives. Every single thing was being wrapped up in newspaper and packed in boxes. Susan was determined to go with the move for the sake of the family. With her kids now grown, Susan was disappointed and said goodbye. She decided to take her children to her new home and move to a bigger place."

He would play around with the noodle dishes until he found a new way to eat them. The camera quickly went out, and he immediately ate a lot. One night he accidentally dropped some noodles, which was his first taste of noodles. After eating the noodles, the camera caught on, and began a story about what it would look like if it were cooked correctly. This is a very popular story in Australia. As kids grow up, we look to our parents for help in teaching the children things they love.","My 6-year-old, who loves dinosaurs, ate noodles with his teeth while demonstrating how they tasted. He was a little fussy but was good with making mistakes. He then smiled and said he was a little dinosaur. He then told me he had just had lunch at my house so I had to get to work right away. As I was doing this, I saw my toddler scream when I was trying to talk to him and he went to get a piece. I said he was a little dinosaur and I wondered if I could ever make up my minds what to think about the movie.","My six-year-old daughter ate noodles in a way that made him laugh, so I watched an early show to help her with that. The children's program had an audience of about 300 people watching. After eating noodles, their favourite noodle dishes sat on the table. It was very hard for my daughter to hear the conversation, but she thought she was listening. The son watched the video on the net with the word 'Screen Learning' on the screen. As she ate, she made out with him and began laughing at her actions.",I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. ‘I’m a little dinosaur’ he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs.,"My six-year-old son had been playing with a toaster for a few days. After school he ate broccoli, noodles, and chicken. His eyes were bright as a light, he wondered what the toaster was for. He was fascinated by dinosaurs so we made him a science unit. He said the toaster is for sand, and I explained we could sand with a toaster if we wanted. We explained that we could sand with a toaster if we wanted. My child went to his classroom to show me a slide, that the toaster was for sand, and that the rice cooker was for sand. He made an impressive noise, dribbling his teeth out. He said we did sand on our table. Finally the toaster was cooked and the rice cooker was cooked again.

C2,"A bike club near Buckinghamshire has raised more than £30,000 a year to help improve the health and well-being of the British workforce. James Marr and Ian McMillan have been training members for over a decade. Their classes are a combination of biking with bamboo, a bike-building machine, and a technical tutorial. They also share some of the bike shop’s facilities and equipment. As part of the programme, you'll also get to work with members of the borough's community to discuss projects ranging from road repairs to air conditioning units.","James Marr, a member of the bamboo bike club, is the lead engineer on a DIY project at their studio in Llanelli. The students make their own custom bike frame, then design a new bicycle using the bike as their inspiration. But when they arrive home they will be seated in a living room and asked to wait at the front desk. The students then begin assembling their bike, which has been specially designed for the project. They have also designed an air spring for the engine which can be fitted. After the first session they make their own tyres, a bike that they designed is ready to be made. The final frame is ready to be put on the bike to finish the day. At Bamboo Bike Club, students have a course designed specifically for the new bike frame. They then learn how to cut and construct it.","This month, a special group of engineers built a bamboo bike. James Marr, an engineer from Glasgow, is making one of the most popular bike-making machines in the UK. The group is led by engineering man Ian McMillan. They make all the machines to get one of the best results from your measurements. The event is free and open to the public.",Two engineers have come up with a simple and practical way to build a bamboo bike from scratch in a tiny shop in the south-west of England. The resulting bike will come with a computer-designed custom frame and a weekend of fun weekend of biking. The students are taught the fundamentals of how to build a bicycle using a computer-based machine.,"You may not have built a bike in your lifetime but you can still make a great one. So how do you get a computer-designed custom frame or bike? The first course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, provides you with access to the technology and tools needed to build this bike. Once you’re done building the custom frame and bike, you’ll be allowed to take it home, or you can return it to the bike shop to make it yourself. After the experience, the participants will have access to a tutorial on how to make a custom frame for their bike. One of the most interesting aspects of the course is how the trainers make you use their tools to make your custom bike, the Bamboo Bike Club’s Steve Mucks. They also teach you to use a bicycle frame as a braking system and can also tell you how to hit the pedals while cycling. The instructors explain the various equipment and tools required to build a custom frame and then make you the basic frame. They also teach you how to control your pedals. At the end of the course, the instructors share their knowledge with you so the students know if they’ve got the right bike for their individual needs and wants. By doing this, you’ll also be able to experience a few of the bikes on display at the Bamboo Bike Club.","Rather than completing a custom bike frame, James Marr and Ian McMillan set out to create a computer-designed custom bike frame. After a couple of days, they went to a bamboo bike shop and completed the course at the Bamboo Bike Club. The course is full of exercise and lots of great laughs.","The bike workshop in Cambridge has been a family tradition since the 1980s, when the first bamboo bike workshop was set up. The place in Cambridge was designed by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. They have created a computer-designed custom frame and a fun weekend of bike-building. The course also provides participants with lessons ranging from taking a science-themed tutorial with an engineering-minded instructor. This includes the introduction of a bike-building technique, and the use of special tools and materials if necessary to build a bike to an advanced level. The workshop also offers a course on basic bike-building. The next month, a workshop will be set up in the grounds of Cambridge, just across the road from the Cambridge Science Center. The course will cover the basics of bike-building: making a frame with an engineering-minded instructor. The bike workshop also features computer-designed custom frames, a tutorial with an engineering-minded instructor, a day at the bicycle workshop, as well as a weekend of bike-building."
C2,Cheney and Seyfarth studied the vervet monkey group. They found a strange male in a neighbouring grove of trees. The male had been seen around with the dominant male in the group. The male was sizing up to join the group. Cheney and Seyfarth decided they did something wrong and tried to kill him. They called the police and they arrested the man.,"Cheney and Seyfarth were studying vervet monkeys and thought about how they should be studying them. However, they saw a strange male hanging around in the grove of trees that was quite visible. The male was looking to join the group for a friend, but it was already sparked up by the man that was sweeping up the tree. So, they tracked down the man and discovered that he was sizing up the group. They then took a walk to the tree to look for him, but the man grabbed the man and ran to the grove to try and find him. The man was spotting the man at first and took him to the grove, but he was spotted three times before. Cheney and Seyfarth learned to recognize the man and were amazed to discover he actually was sizing up the group. The man was spotted by Cheney and Seyfarth, and they figured out how to catch him.","Cheney and Seyfarth were researching a group of vervet monkeys. They observed a curious male hanging around in the neighbouring grove of trees. The man wanted the stranger to join his group. Cheney spotted the strange man, which he found very odd.","The leaders of their biology class, Cheney and Seyfarth, decided to go to nature. The leaders knew each other well enough to be familiar with each other. Suddenly, their group was suddenly slammed for two or three years by one and then the two of them decided to separate. Cheney and Seyfarth then noticed that the first group was a strange male. They explained that he was the male behind the white noises. They also learned that his right ear was left open. The second group then arrived and sat at the tree and watched the white noises. The males then noticed that their right ear was lying through the tree while their left ear was lying under the branches. The males then began a series of attacks and attacked the tree. The man then began to run into the tree to save the tiger on the tree. Cheney and Seyfarth then found an old trunk which was strewn across the tree. This strewn around the tree gave the males a pause and a sound. After they separated the body from the tree, the man noticed that there was a strange male in the tree. It began to close its eyes, and Cheney and Seyfarth realized that this was a male. The group had to fight back or they would be decapitated, but this was the first time that the man had ever been in contact with an animal before. Cheney and Seyfarth then learned that the male was sizing up their group, aiming to join the group. This was a very early start for Cheney and Seyfarth.","The Vervet monkeys were studying a wild animal, the white tiger. After a day of studying they noticed a strange male hanging around in a grove of trees. The man was really just trying to slam on the fence to protect the monkeys. The white tiger fled with the monkeys.",Cheney and Seyfarth were observing a new species of vervet monkeys at a local zoo. They noticed a strange male hanging out in a neighbouring grove of trees. The male was sizing up the group because he was afraid of the new monkeys and being afraid of its safety. The two researchers felt it was a strange idea to hang out alone if they could.,"Cheney and Seyfarth were studying the monkeys in a grove and found the male sizing up. His intentions were quite evident, so they were intrigued. This escaped the monkeys quickly when the leader, sleeping under the tree, climbed into the grove. He then opened a ring to hold the male. He observed a different male, which was hiding under the branches. He found the male and proceeded to gather the monkeys, and reposition them according to the monkeys’ behaviour."
C2,By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. For the rest of my life I have been having the same perversions regarding my own art.,"The idea that the world will be filled by beautiful works of art can be seen on the outside. But how do works of art work? It is only natural that a great deal of history will take place outside. The problem is that art creates these objects by moving them out of their original form. What the artist's intention to produce explains much about our perception of beauty, so it becomes part of our culture. This is the reason why art creates the illusion that it is only a product that exists externally.","We learn that a master is a genius, but an expert is not. His artistic rigor and piety are rooted in a perversity that goes beyond aesthetics. His paintings and sculptures are examples of a master’s knowledge of art. To avoid the potential obstacles, the master must focus his attention on aesthetics and the arts.","After a long-distance journey a long time ago I went to visit an art gallery. I found a sculpture made of metal and decided to try to make a piece of art. I made a piece of art that was both large and small. I decided to make a statue that was both large and small. I decided to make a sculpture made of copper, and I made a piece of copper, and a bronze statue that was both large and small. I was pleased that the bronze statue was larger than my bare body. The resulting sculpture is an example of art. I realized that the sculpture was made from copper, and that I melted copper into the glass for its structural integrity. I realized that the sculpture is made of copper, and that the glass is a copper-like material. I found an interesting piece of art at a gallery called Eos. At the end of the day I realized that I must stop making art.","These days the world revolves around the movement of art and literature from conception to modernization. Most art has the same history. Modern art has a past that is largely abstract and incomplete. Modern art is one of these pasts. This particular history is represented by the artist and the artist. Art is represented by the sculpture, sculpture, the glass, the textiles and the paper. This is a period in history. So, why is it important that art is an object of a particular time?","They are often confused about the different things that the artists do. The artist is a visual artist who makes many impressions. He is a graphic artist who aims to make the viewer more aware of his work. He has the ability to think about things like, in person or print. He uses this kind of art to convey to people what he says to them. His art shows how he does these kinds of things by displaying them in his art. He tells us how to connect art to the world.","On the last day of a class in linguistics, the professor asked his students to put their ideas into their creative writing. They all learned that their teachers taught the students art pedagogy. They learned that the students' artistic thinking was driven by a philosophy of avoiding racial and ethnic tension. They also studied the arts as a way of avoiding racism and discrimination. Their classroom teachers also shared stories about their art. By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically."
C2,"The only thing I can say is that I have a fascination with the world of sand. The more I think of it, the easier it becomes for me. It can be a hostile barrier that is placed between the seaside car park and water itself. So unless the sand is to be recycled then it is not to be. My favourite object here is the 'concrete' from the sand.","A boy and his mother are about to go boating on the seaside. On the day before their trip, he picks a large piece of sand from the sea. He hurries to the beach to take a look at the sand. After he's done, he gets his car keys and coins out from the sand. The boy is very pleased with the result. Now the student is on the beach.","By the time I had a chance to go into the car park, I was afraid the sand would blow in your face and get in your sandwiches. I knew that the sand would cause damage to the car. So I got the sand in the carpark and headed out to pick up an object. Once we were all soaked, I walked out of the car. It was an angry storm. I thought about what I would do with my car now. It was a huge thunderstorm and I could not wait for the thunderstorm to get better.","My brother's family has an obsession with the seaside car park that is located in it, ostensibly because of the salt that sand accumulates on it. A lot of the sand is actually made of chalk that was previously dredged from the bottom of the car park. While the sand is primarily a hostile barrier, the sand is a wonderful material for crafting objects and assorted other tools. It comes in a variety of colors and shapes, and the colors it makes are as simple as a red bottle. It floats right in front of the car park. The only other good thing about the sand is that it is light enough for everyone to enjoy. My brother has never seen his kids play in a piece of sand.","If you are not a fan of sand and have a styrofoam sandwich box you would not want to put it on your sandwiches. But then again, it is much easier to make a sandwich on the road. It is really dangerous to use sand in a sandwich box and even in the car park. It will keep you covered until you make your sandwich. You will still get hurt if you try to keep your sandwich in the sand and it may get stuck on your car keys.","So I’m talking about a sand. Sand is the very last thing you want in a car, but it looks really ugly in the real world. But it’s the only thing that keeps you away from the car. But this sand is also very useful for building the outside of the car. It blows your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows objects like car keys and coins. And the air bubbles around it. And now I wonder, is that the air is actually air? It is not. To me, that’s like a big dangling cockroach. To me, the air bubble is the opposite of the sand and not a sand! The air bubble makes my mouth hurt more than the sand did. The rain comes from the beach, and I scream every time I get home. But you can’t do it in your face. If you do, your stomach is shaking at times. And the sand smells bad. So, the sand doesn’t even bother to eat anything. I mean, it’s sand. But then you can actually see the sand and it’s all that stuff. As I walk back to the car park, I notice the air slams in. And there’s a big rucksack of sand that looks like it belongs on the table. And it’s that big. I’ve even heard that it might have to be some kind of thing from a human in order to break the air bubble.",I have an apartment and I want to rent sand for a summer holiday. At first I am very excited because I think it looks really cool. But when I look around at some people who are actually using the sand I find they think they must be the owners of the apartment as opposed to the sand being contaminated. So when I see something in the apartment I am surprised. I saw it being mixed into sand and there was no sign of the sand being contaminated. I thought a good thing because the sand is the most densely woven thing in the apartment. My apartment is on the sea side but not by the water itself. My only object is the car keys. I think the sand does the trick for me. The sand is dangerous to me.
C2,"Television has largely ruined the creative process of creating programmes about painting and sculpture in the past, especially now when it comes to film and TV. Why is the industry so consistently failing as to whether it has the talent, vision and money to produce a coherent story? Today, with the introduction of the VHS recorder, digital art has become a reality. The lack of creative content has led to artistic demands and the idea of artistic content being made as available as free of charge. The creators are in desperate need of funding for their new project, which will feature an acclaimed art programme, ""Art on TV"". As well as a host of programmes from BBC Radio 5 live, the documentary is available on Netflix. It has been recommended for its creators as an alternative to a book, and should be produced for free. The film aims to take itself forward to the big screen and the wider public but it has been called a ‘theatre of art’ and has been made quite a success.","Artists and people were watching TV shows to get to know more about their artwork, so they decided to try art on TV. Before it started, a series of paintings were shown, one was titled ""Jumping and Sculpting"", and the other was titled ""Essas Paints & Scents."" This show focused on how to use traditional painting to make different kinds of work. When the series finished, it was told that it would do the best it could with a large set of photographs. The final piece of work showed the effects of the painting and sculpture.","You might have seen Art On TV. What is the scream? When I sat down the next morning, I was amazed by the volume of programmes that TV had been programming about the visual arts. Why hasn't the art remained around for so many years? It doesn't seem to have a big impact on the show and is just very difficult to see. Is it really the artist's ability to have a shot on an object - or should they all be allowed to take a break, observe and comment? My eyes are closed and the viewer is overwhelmed, but I don't believe it is what TV is all about. Whoever decides to ignore art on TV should just stay on and try to get it back to the level where it's necessary to do - and then leave. You will be amazed at the intensity of the work. So why hasn't the TV show improved? This has been done many times, the censorship levels have fallen on people who want to go to the movies and buy movies. If you want to see a real-life show or a documentary that focuses on the works of art that are in a cinema, it's not as challenging to see a broader audience of people watching.","A teacher told her son that it's difficult to show art on TV because of the constant lack of a camera to film it. The class has had to try many programs to find the right balance of time and space, but he thought that there was not enough information about the visual arts, and that there was too much censorship about it. The teacher was very impressed with the camera and did a fine job of providing a safe, well-spaced, revealing and well-presented art. He felt it was worth giving the class a chance to consider the difference between the visual and the musical and decided that it must be a matter for the viewer to focus on. She took a pause between taking a picture and then moving her eyes into an art display case, resulting in her showing the work of art to her daughter.","The main subject in a TV program is drawing. If people are interested in drawing, painting and sculpture, they would consider it as art. Television, the only technology available, has failed to show this visual subject. In fact, only programmes about the visual arts are shown in the same way as on film, and only those programmes are shown in the same kind of way as art. What about this? What about the use of the camera and lenses? What about the light? This issue also occurs in programmes that have an agenda. Television is incapable of showing the whole work of art at the same time as it is actually moving. The only practical reason why the programme is often seen in television is to show the images to a broad audience rather than simply the viewers.","After a couple of years of being in television, I have been a long-time TV admirer. But this week a new ad and a new concept of the media has moved me to tears. As an art fan, I'd rather see a piece of art than a TV programme of TV about the visual arts. I've seen a series of paintings and a series of sculptures over the last decade but I've never had a time to see them. The ad is based on the painting of a man with a flower in his hands which he's been painting since his birth and the sculptures are made with paper. The ad also seems to imply that the woman is using paint and is being painted with a brush or with a paint brush.","There have been many attempts to introduce the art to TV, including creating a new movie, and trying out different aspects of the visual arts. Some programmes also focus on the visual arts as an extra way to spend time. Most programs focus on artistic subjects as they are not presented as anything a viewer can see. Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? The television industry's performance of its programme arts is one of the first attempts to make this effort. The arts in television are not usually explored in the same manner, so only a few people see them. Television has a much larger role in the production of programmes about the visual arts. However, there is an art program about which people can get very interested. The main focus of the programme was on the way television shows are portrayed, exposing the visual arts as they are presented, and showing a real show."
C2,"We are all interested in films that we’ve done in our spare time. I went to a few studios to look into something. This one was fine. We were looking at some good new shorts. We decided to look at a few of our other short films too. I decided to try and do something fun. So I have a project to test out. I’ve put up posters on the wall and posted a few of my pictures on the screen. I hope I’m not the only one. All those people who try to go for a long, boring interview have a problem with their work. The critters want to be around and the actors are afraid to ask. I tried to a few of the actors and get some advice. Luckily I found a funny opportunity to ask them how they have worked so far. I tried doing a video - a film about the character of a gay man. I liked a few of the actors, but no one cared that they weren’t doing something fun, either. It was really, really a film, and I didn’t care that actors were watching too much. This was actually a very fun show with lots of people talking about their philosophies, and the film/theatre companies got the best of them.","A young actor has a bad case of talent. He looks like a jerk. He carries the wrong ring, and has a hard time telling the truth. He doesn’t know how to tell the truth! His fellow actors want to be considered actors, and they are. When they talk about their craft, they are told not to.","The actor is seen on the screen interviewing actors in a performance. He takes a break from this scene and talks about his work. A lot of his talent is in him, but he has a long history of equivocation. He talks about his work, not his recollection of his time. His most important job is to get money. His jobs can be lucrative. He doesn’t want to work for the studio. He wants to stay at home, but there is no opportunity. He wants to take his business elsewhere. One day a director visits to ask actor Tim about a performance he is doing. Tim gives him a few minutes to explain his own craft. He explains how he makes films and plays his part to earn money. Tim’s film is about a gangster, who’s trying to convince a group of friends to change a dead man’s name. Tim gives him a few minutes to explain what he does to make this movie. Tim then goes to a movie theater, which is in his hometown. He gives Tim a piece of paper explaining he used to make films. Tim shows him the play he is playing, which he’s done many times for the past five years. Tim then goes back to film, and tells Tim he needs more money. Tim then talks about how he made his screenplay, which he’s made a lot of money on, and that it will be a good movie. Tim tells Tim how he’ll be able to get more money. Tim then talks about how he worked on his picture, and how he’ll be able to do a show with his own production. The interview shows how his craft was being criticized by actors and producers.","A movie or theatre company asks actors and actresses about their talents. The actor, who is a producer or screenwriter, has many talents and is known to be a good talent. But when an interviewer asks them about their talents and what they have to say, they rebuff the actors. The actor is fired from the screen for the interview. A star is fired from the screen for her performance. A talent is sprayed at actors and is derived into contempt by the actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft. In the interview, the actor describes their skill and how they make money.","A actor who performs in films is dissatisfied with the manner and manner in which actors are treated. Afterwards he’s forced to turn down some of his films because they’re a part of an interview. He does not think he should pay any attention to his comrades or colleagues in the film industry, but instead he takes them to an exclusive interview. The actor also has a mischievous attitude about acting. He doesn’t know he’s bad at acting, he’s just trying to do something wrong. The actors themselves are sprayed at by their film/theater companies when they’re compelled to talk about their craft or themselves in interviews.","This week, there were more than 200 film/theatre companies making talk about their films. The average person knows about 80% of the films and theatre companies. That means they spend more time interviewing the actors. Those interviews will reveal themselves to the audience. What do the actors see in the interview? What do they think of the actors themselves? Do they seem to be confident enough to discuss their craft with the audience? Observe some of the interviewer reactions and write down what you think the audience thinks. What do the actors do? Which are they talking about? Do the actors really care about the performers? Write down the responses that the audience has to their interview.","As the movie industry became involved with film productions, actors began being interviewed for interviews. They started to show their disdain. As the productions continued, many actors began talking about their craft. They started to expose their problems and problems with their characters. Much of this disdain is fuelled by their actors themselves when they’re compelled by their film/theater companies to talk about their craft."

A new study has shown that career success in a career is no longer enough? Despite the new findings, the question of success in a career is not always true. What's not true is that happiness does not define happiness. If you are the most popular person in society, you deserve the best job and happiness. But if you are one of the most successful persons, you are still in the minority. One example is Theodore Zeldin who has won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008.","A young man, Theodore Zeldin, is a good man. Whenever a stranger brings his new work into his company, he is outraged.

C2,"I'm an extremely hard-nosed and highly expressive poet. The other poets have a soft touch that make them feel as if they are being re-enamored. I live by a few walls, but when I have been to one of the most extraordinary places I've ever walked, I think I might have heard a few words. I have also heard a hummingbird singing and a owl singing. My only regret is that i didn't see the owl singing. The owl singing sounded lovely when I was a girl. What do people do without language? They can't understand. Or sometimes they can't imagine life without it.","You two are a species that cannot imagine life without words. We are unique because of our ability to shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. As a species, we use language in ways many people can't understand. This ability allows us to use words in ways that people will have never heard of. There are many possibilities in our life that cannot be imagined without language. People learn to express themselves through actions, words and actions. These interactions are not mutually exclusive and should be experienced as part of our daily lives.","When I arrived at my apartment recently to take a vacation, I knew that the first thing a visitor would do was to walk up to the window. After looking around for a long time, I walked out with my bags. I had been thinking about what to do. To this day I am still trying to decide what to do next. When I walk out of the window, I notice how people are exchanging words.","When someone breaks into a chat room, I tell them that I belong to a species with a remarkable ability. I feel it is my personal choice to speak with them. Our ancestors will never speak with anyone. They will always hear us chitchatting in a social context. Our shared values, which we can tell others about, depend on how we connect with one another. Our unique values are matched only by that of each other. I'm an amazing person, and I will never take anything for granted. I always have a good time communicating with someone. I love how the person I connect with is so excited about what's coming in my life. My ability is a way to communicate with others. I love how we can express a desire that goes unmet. I find it very difficult to understand what someone really wants. I am sure if you're going to do something, that's what you're going to do. When you're meeting someone, you will need a very special person. They'll be the only one that you can tell how you feel about something. When you're meeting people, it can be very difficult to imagine what they're really feeling. This is how you can show that.","I am a creature of habit and people, because we use language and make things better. You are a bird and you can communicate with your bird when in distress. You can sense how their body uses language, and you can sense how their brain operates and learn them. But you know the bird tells you how you communicate with it, so you must have a bird’s mouth. Because you communicate with it, you will live without your bird. However, when you exchange words, they will understand you as it's the bird that makes them feel special.","In the ages of our current president, you can use language like ___________________________________________________________. You know that in our daily lives, we have to write in other peoples brains. You'll learn how to read word _______________________________________________________________________________________________.","My wife and I have an experience of human beings, such as the one we were talking about in class. I want to know more about how we live our lives. I’m interested to know how we use language in the different parts of our lives. We find people that are interacting with other people in a variety of ways. We look forward to working together as an example of the human condition."
C2,"Hayward Gallery in London is one of the most beautiful places in the world. It's a great place to enjoy a piece of art. But when the opportunity came up to view one of its art collections, the Hayward Gallery re-opened. They were so incredibly enthusiastic. They opened in June to celebrate its 60th anniversary. They took an interest in the art and created the exhibit. So they started with an artist, Alex Jones, who had taken her own creations in the gallery. They are now in the process of acquiring more and more objects. Their work is unique, it is very unusual and unique. And their work is unique. They are not restricted to one form of art. They have a reputation for drawing and painting from different angles. Their work is about making things in a particular space. But in the 1970s, they had a movement. They started experimenting with sculptures in the gallery. Artwork they created has been exhibited at Hayward Gallery over the last 30 years. Their latest exhibition, Kinetic Art Rejoice, examines what made kinetic art popular. It is about a collection of objects and is called movement, and one that is dominated by movement. The exhibition is now in its third year of funding. But many have remained silent: the gallery now appears empty, but the art critics say it still looks eerie. At Hayward Gallery, you can relive the rebirth of kinetic art through the work of artisan Charles Woods, one of his most famous painters. He started showing his art by hand, and his signature is the ‘Faiths in Violent Art.’ His artwork is titled Objects, he is a well-known painter of modern art. He lives in London and is a poet. They are not just an artist or collector but a famous figure. Their art is part of the visual and performing arts, and their work often has a rich and enchanting story to it. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the last 60 years. So how does it work?","After seeing what the art world described as “kneading sculpture,” I finally got bored and called the giraffes to do the skeletons. I found a rather peculiar display, which is the best way to know that there were these skeletons in the gallery. But there is much more to do if I am going to use this exhibition to explain what was really happening in the gallery and how people were moving. There are a few objects. There are people performing and reading the art. There are performers. There are people doing sculpture. There are people showing paintings. People are taking pictures. They are taking photos. They are being interviewed. The exhibition looks at what was happening in the gallery and what the skeletons were like. It is a little bit like drawing on a chalkboard.","Kinetic Art Rejoice is a new exhibition of the most influential visual art in London’s history. The exhibition, entitled “Kinetic Art: An Exploration into An almost Never-Seen Art” (Trust), traces the history of the modern art movement in the twentieth century. The art movement has become a practice in European art, and it is thought that the movement may have been initiated via art and the work of a child. Using this model the exhibition explores the movement of the human mind as it takes place in objects such as paintings, cars, furniture, and sculptures. These subjects are represented in the Hayward Gallery.","A recent exhibition in Hayward Gallery took a fascinating look at modern kinetic art. It was the subject of a survey which analyzed what people liked about kinetic art. The exhibit, which takes visitors on a tour of Hayward Gallery’s archives and reflects on the art movement from the 20th century.","A fascinating exhibition of kinetic art, entitled Kinetic Art Rejoice, is being exhibited at the Hayward Gallery in London. London’s Hayward Gallery was transformed into a place full of wonder by its unusually low budget. Here, the exhibition traces the history of kinetic art by the artist Andrew Moore. The show was a collection of kinetic art and its art critic Adrianne Kedley wrote. The exhibition examines the evolution of art in an almost forgotten area of a city. Each artwork is described in detail. The artist's main concern is creating movement. Annie Hall, the gallery’s managing director, hopes to be exhibited at the Hayward Gallery in London for the first time. She also hopes to show off his latest artworks, with an extensive use of the technology offered by the Hayward Gallery. This exhibition also includes work by John Riederling, the celebrated author of the book ‘Art is Good'. The gallery also features a number of kinetic sculptures, including the famous frog statue that inspired David Morrissey’s paintings on a blackened board.","A group of art explorers discovered a large collection of fossils, and found some of their subjects buried there. It was hard to find any fossils to take with them. To find the fossils, the art collector went to the Hayward Gallery. He wondered what they were like and luckily, a small amount was found. It turned out that the fossils were in excruciating and sometimes painful state. However, in 1939 the museum was once again closed due to a serious illness, and the artist had no access to any other art. But the art curator wanted to take a photograph of the two pieces because of their nature. The resulting photos, taken more than 30 years later, will highlight the greatness of the specimens that the art had been preserved in.","An exhibition at the Hayward Gallery has transformed a building from a neglected but rarely exhibited art gallery into a wonderland. In the exhibition, a group of young professionals and experts are exploring kinetic art in the twentieth century. But it is their work that made the modern art world so much more ordinary. The exhibition is focused on an area of kinetic art – the history of the movement of a living thing, which involves moving something, and also on movement. The exhibition will be shown at Hayward Gallery in London on Thursday from 1 May until 4 May."
C2,"Paul Simon joined the rock band Genesis in the 1950s. His mother praised him for his musical abilities, as he went on to sing and sing rock hits and get into the mainstream. The group was the first foray into the rock scene, and Paul Simon was just about the only singer a member of that group. But in the 1950s, they moved forward. In early 1950, Paul Simon played a huge number of pop songs, and became one of the most popular singers in the world. He began to use his musical talent as an instrument, and became one of the biggest stars of the 1950s. His songs led the raging of the hip-hop rock scene.","Paul Simon was a teenager who played music with his parents and the older boys. During the 1950s, the group went from cult to youth, and both boys were known for their abilities. Paul was a teenager who lived in a small town but rediscovered music in the 1950s. Both girls loved the music, however, and Paul and his parents hoped it would be as popular as Rock and roll in the 1950s. So the boys joined up with other guys on the group to learn how to play the music.","Paul Simon is a pop musician and singer from a hometown in Washington, D.C. He was born and raised in the small town of Chicago, where he had a large sex life. He discovered a secret from the world that was a secret from the world - he would not drink from a machine. He never got into trouble. He was raised in an orphanage by his mother, Helena, and was a self-made artist at a boarding school. His family moved to Chicago, and he lived there for many years. He was a popular singer, he played the first songs on his records. He also played parts of his famous 1960s hit, The Way to U We Are. He was a popular leader for his favorite band in the early 1950s. Many of his songs were popular in the 1950s and the 1970s. His first single, Love and Peace, was called by his mother. She was also known as Paul Simon's favorite artist. This song had a profound influence on him. It also paved the way for the next generation of Rock and Roll idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked to their destinies.","Paul Simon was a British-American rock band that formed in the late 1950s. It played rock and roll and was popular in England at that time. At that time, rock became largely a youth cult, with many singers avoiding being involved with the rock genre. At the time, Simon was best known as a popular singer who was famous for his work at The Beatles and The Beatles. However, by the mid 1950s, Simon started making music more about the culture of the 1970s and 1980s. He listened to Rock and Roll with awestruck admiration to what he saw, the people around him and the music. He became a rock icon in the mid-1950s, becoming one of Britain's most popular bands. Throughout the last few decades, the group dominated the music industry. During that time, Simon’s fame had continued. He started doing solo jazz and did some touring on occasion. In 1974, Simon announced his retirement from singing and joined the group, ""Lyrics on Old Radio"". In 1987, Simon moved from New York to London to become a journalist. He also became an executive editor for a magazine and was promoted as the President of the BBC Music Journal. In 1989, he made his professional debut on Billboard's Top 40 Rock and Roll. In 1990, he appeared on a number of albums, such as the 'Worst Beatles Album', he became a touring performer. He later became an executive producer on his own record label The British rockers. His solo career lasted only one year, and he died in 1986.","Paul Simon was a young male singer who went from solo to group, in a career lasting until his death in 1952. His first single appeared in 1954 and was very successful. He also released a few albums on the same label including ""Baby Love"" and ""Seven Years Later"" which he released on the same label. He enjoyed the sounds of the songs that his solo career would produce. Then, the songs of his younger brother Jerry saw more of a pop sound. Although he was not born in a wealthy household, he still lived in his home and loved music. He died in an automobile accident in 1959. He was 92 years old.","Paul Simon had been a cult for many years. He was also one of the most popular artists in the 1950s and 1960s. He grew up in the upper class. He enjoyed his music, and liked it! Paul started singing and writing songs. Music, and the musical era were a huge influence for the young artists and the young musicians. In the 1950s, musicals were more popular than they were in the 1980s, when new styles were being invented. People enjoyed listening to rock in the 1950s and 1960s. A new generation of rock idols enjoyed their music, and that new generation was excited. In the 80s, music was relegated to a place that was still popular. This is the day the music became the norm for some of the artists and bands that made it to the top of the charts.","Paul Simon was a very influential singer whose solo career began before 1960, before it was largely the result of a largely unheard-of rock cult. His early albums paved the way for high-pitched, blues fusion and early rock bands like Pink Floyd. His influence on the musical spectrum, however, came from a more modern, soulful sound that could reach far out into space, the sounds of country rock, blues rock and soul, and blues rock. Rock and roll is often thought of as a modern day rock-era disco cult, unlike some other genres. Paul Simon was an old man's man and a former high-pitched rock star, as well as a rock singer. The most popular recordings of rock and roll in the 1950s were those that played in the early 20th century and that played a prominent role in the early 1960s. It reflected a generation of young, talented musicians who admired the music and helped shape young people's destinies."
C2,"In history, we often view a collection as being repainted as a picture of the poet or writer. We would also see the poem as still life in the world, like a picture of the artist in a new painting, but have not re-read it since. So in the past, we were aware of a group of poets announcing their work, which resulted in the choice of the poem as the subject. Instead, the image became a painting. Today, in view of the recent change in the artistic landscape, we can see both of those groups as art. Today's collective, artistic people have chosen a poem or painting which they consider to be the best portrait of the poet or author. We can rethink them.","The word ""depictive"" is a word used to express the power of imagination, the power to see things in context, and the inability of people to imagine a future. Some people take this as a compliment in general and others as a compliment to themselves. We try to think of a picture of life in the moment when one of the happiest moments in life occurs. There is a moment of the writer's life that is a rebirth of the present. There is a day when one of the happiest things is done: we are reborn into the world. The artist is the person or group that is a reflection of the moment. Each artist is reflected in his life. He is the person or group that sees the situation and gives an opinion. This means that a piece of art reflects a moment in history.",At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view.,"The English literary scene in Europe has been plagued by conflict of opinion and the poets must contend with the fact that they do not have all the right to publish their work. I want to write a story to explain the political situation in Europe, the conflicts it has been a part of. For example, the Irish government has banned foreign nationals from travelling to China and other countries in search of their papers, but there is a growing acceptance among writers that the language and politics of China are completely free of interference. For example, in the US, a large number of people are willing to write to a different editor for publication. The historical picture of China is viewed as a reflection of the social and cultural situation. The poet has a strong tradition of having translated some of his works. At any given time in history, the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. The essay, a study of China, focuses on an 1848 document, which is an original work.","This poem by Mary Shelley explores the meaning of the word ""recital"" by the writer Robert Oppenheimer. The poem introduces a plethora of different poets and authors, each describing one or more of their works. The poem is written by Shelley whose name we know now as Sheila. Shelley's own poetry is credited with the first appearance of the word recital.","Cathy wrote a piece about eminence. To that end, he decided to give a retrospective view of his work. As a student who just started reading, he decided to give a retrospective view of his work to show that it was all eminence and not eminence. As you can see from the photo, eminence is one of the items referred to in one of the two essays in the piece.","This person read an essay by Shakespeare stating he was pleased to see the book's title change. He chose the word ""history"" first in the essay because it was his favorite poet and followed with his name. In his essay he shows the eminence of people on the literary scene. He reveals the order of eminence he describes using the adjective ""othello"" and shows it is emphasized with his tan hair, ""the hairy part is the way."" However, he also shows some characteristics of the author. His essay asks the reader to describe a person's perspective of his or her eminence."

He thought the cry was very ethical and would not harm humanity, but it would hurt his own mind. That year, John Bowlby published a book on psychology that showed the effect of crying. This book was critical to his theory.",The teacher and friend suggested to her that the mother should try to communicate more clearly to her daughter if her daughter had been crying. So she asked her friend to explain how the school teacher was telling them about the cry. She did this and she told her teacher to give her the answer. Because of this she was so happy! The teacher said it made her feel better. That night she cried for the whole week.,"John Bowlby found that crying has an important effect on children's development and cognitive abilities. Before he knew it, he started crying with his daughter. His theory was that crying was beneficial to the development of a child's personality. Now, people are becoming aware of that. He suggested that tears were an important part of the development of childlike emotion. Today, the world seems to be shifting from our view of the world towards a more 'humanistic' view about world order. Most of us have emotions related to something that isn't right or right. Whether the emotions we experience are not the effects that we wish, our reality is often very distorted. The world is becoming more and more complex. There is now a society of caring and caring about the world.","I decided to go in a group hug when we first began crying. I was going to use that idea for myself and I was excited. I felt bad for our friend's mother, but she made a big deal of it. Her mom was really proud to see her and gave her time to cry. I did cry like a lot of teenagers do. My friend just had a girl friend too and she enjoyed her new friend's interaction. I'd give her a hug. Now that they're over we all want to take it and go for a walk. I'm going to say no one should have a hug. My friend and I went for a walk today and I had a great time.",Charles Darwin believed the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose.

One of these was an old man in his 20s. The other was a new man in his 50s who stayed with him for a year. It happened on 9/11 after he saw an accident on the subway that caused his legs to be cut. Suddenly the man in the front seat of his car was suddenly swept into the street by a passing van, followed by a policeman and his family who were on their way to the airport. As the ambulance arrived it was reported that the man in the front seat was missing.

We were talking about the most basic aspect of cooking: food.",My favorite food is food! I am a huge fan of it if we eat it but I am not a super huge fan when I eat it. I like that our relationships have that sense of connection.,"Food was my favorite subject in high school, I learned from my mother what she used to like about cooking and what she likes to cook with the meal. I also enjoyed eating my mother's breakfast and reading books about how to use a microwave for cooking. Food always brings to mind something new and interesting for me. I know I'll be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting.","For me, cooking has always been the best way to entertain.

I found cooking on the verge of becoming a career. Food and its sycophants, slop and mediocre. Everything was made for the highest standards of cooking, such as being pressured, not in control. And it took a long time to learn the skills. I am so dismayed that the culinary world does not allow me to try to be good at it. The best thing I could do is eat. But I'd rather sit down, work in the kitchen with the kitchen in the background. I know I'll never succeed in the kitchen.

While going through culinary school I learned that cooking took a lot of dedication. I learned that many people can't cook properly - it takes a lot of patience. The more you know what you know, the less you can learn. The more difficult it is to prepare things correctly. So I learned to cook. The more I learned, the less I could learn to cook. Cooking is a harsh profession, with no easy access to training. So I didn't want to take any classes to get a better knowledge of kitchens. I wanted to enjoy every minute of every day. So I started to study culinary science as a job in art. However, my first real experience was in the culinary world. The more I learned, the better I was at teaching people to cook.

She taught me how to cook and that I liked cooking, and she made me a beautiful dish. We also learned about her job in the school newspaper, and both her friends told me about the work. My decision to become a chef came as a big surprise. As time went on and as my career grew, my friends were looking for other opportunities that would put them at ease in their lives. That is where I learned the joy of cooking, which is what I found most rewarding in my culinary career.","Having completed the culinary school at university, I decided to make my dream of becoming a chef my reality. I began studying with Chef Jodie Smith who taught me all about the job. I ate a lot and was surprised to find out that this was the way I was going to be cooking. I knew the skills needed to cook with confidence and without the money spent. I was attracted to her and became close friends with her. I chose to take up this position but had to overcome the pressure to prepare meals. At the end of my school year I studied to become a chef. I wanted to have such a beautiful career and to have such good memories in what would become the restaurant of my dreams. In the meantime the food was cooked down and the pressure was put on me to cook. After I learned of the job I was given, I set on to culinary school. My career took another turn. My life changed, the pressure was put on me to cook and the pay was disappointing. I was very disappointed. Then I decided to be a chef. This was what I wanted to do. The kitchen was a horrible experience to me. All of this work came at a very high cost. I thought this was a bad choice. I am really happy I chose this career purely because I hoped the job would give me a huge taste of the good I had achieved as a student. I had to make some impromptu mistakes in trying to impress his friend, so there was a lot of me to judge as well.",One day I was a student cooking at university. I had a friend invite me to dinner. They were so impressed I decided to try something new. I decided to try different things a little different. We were all intrigued. I sat down and made up my mind as to whether or not I would be a chef. My first few experiences were a different experience - a cook scheming the ingredients. It was not the ideal combination - but I was determined to follow it. I loved the way it was a personal decision. And I thought it was a beautiful and creative experience - albeit the most rewarding one.,"I decided that I wanted to be a chef. I started studying cookery at the university. I found the work very rewarding, but I was disappointed because I wished to have a better understanding of the profession. The culinary profession was not on the face of it an attractive profession. It was on the bleak side, with much too much pressure on the individual's part and long pay to achieve a certain status. But for the culinary profession, the work is long pressured, menial, and badly paid. The food I made was unappealing, expensive, and very little delicious. A teacher coached me to make a basic meal out of a soup. As I started cooking I started to worry less about losing food, because, despite having a good knowledge of how to cook, it is much more challenging. I learned that the work of a cook is a very lonely and boring job. Cooking, of course, is not for everyone. I am a busy person and the work is very demanding and hard-working. But I was pleased to learn that it is possible to make my own food if I put in effort. The job of a chef is a very rewarding job. The job is also rewarding. Then came my advice. I could learn from a chef a simple lesson, ""you can cook anything. Anything. Anything.""",I'm a slob from university and a chef. I worked in restaurants as a waitress. I learned a lot about how to cook as a young adult. I began cooking the meal for my family and friends. The meal was very well served and tasted amazing. The food was so fresh that I was surprised that the chef couldn't get his job. I also learned that people can enjoy eating at home without getting a cut. That is an unusual choice.
C2,I was sitting down in the dining room when I realised I’d slept in the dining room. We were having a conversation about a good meal. I sat down on the bed before making plans to get up. Several tables of plates were sitting around. I was about to show my dad that my dad was doing me a favour. My dad said he was so nice to him.,Tim Rice was a painter. His grandfather was a painter and his parents were both musicians. They were an economics major when he entered his family’s small kitchen. I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class.,"Tom had moved to London to make his first trip abroad and hoped he would become a chef or writer. He got into a rut as he always tended to be unappreciated but always looked forward to working at a large food company. But one day when he first arrived, the family was at a party and Tom sat in the kitchen with his friend. The next day, Tom got the idea of working in the kitchen for his school's cafeteria so he could make a nice lunch. When the young man had taken his first steps, Tom felt that he might get distracted and could not figure out anything. Later that evening the family asked Tom to join them in their next breakfast. The young man took the opportunity and began to look at various places to eat. After he had decided he would move to the parlour, Tom looked up to the young man.","I was told about a building from the newspaper. We had decided on a big building for a new house, not an old building in the middle of a new development. My room was a sort of oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by the most shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. But i had to tell you that I was introduced to the young man as his bumbling friends. He turned up the lights on and was in the dining room. When we first met his mother, he said he liked his dining room. But when he turned back, he had not seen his wife. What about his wife’s brother, John, or the avowed friend, Robert? The man’s family was a lot more conservative than they would seem. They had only two children, so that was very hard for him to understand. He has been a trouble maker, and for a long time has been in that position. So as you would expect, this was the most difficult part. Whenever I saw his wife there was a lot more of a surprise.","I am a college graduate who just moved into a huge apartment building in the northern part of Edinburgh. I travelled across Scotland a couple of times to see a show of art. I saw an art exhibition at the Royal Society which I thought was very interesting. It started as a family friend’s home. As I was walking along with the young man, he walked away with something to say and a few words. The artist of the exhibition was a very talented illustrator, but he was more interested in painting, drawing and the arts. I then approached the young man and he began describing his favourite artwork to me. He started by telling me his favourite images are the most iconic of all – the apple tree in winter. I showed him around his studio for a while, then got to work on his painting. He finished the drawing, and looked back at me. I then went out of his way to ask him to help me with the portrait of himself. By now I was working on the painting and he was talking to me about his work. I then started working on my first painting and the young man began to draw. I began creating paintings in the drawing room. He then started to add his pieces to the larger canvas. His work began to change at a snail’s pace. I began referring to it as his art. The art came together so well that it turned into a series of paintings in his gallery. I began to work on my next painting, and I began drawing more of his work. He got a small part of it done by a young artist in a local bar. The result was more and more paintings. I was amazed and a little saddened by the end.","I had just moved from a hotel to a new room. This was a great experience for a younger man who wanted to live there, he has a discerning palate and is not very fond of social life. The young man grew up on a big family block. At first, he seemed like a very haughty young man and would change things easily by himself and without a family. He would find it very difficult to stay in a family where they had many people. He enjoyed going to the movies with his family and was happy to have him as part of their family. The young man became very familiar with the area and enjoyed meeting new people. Whenever the family had dinner, he would often share a meal, and also try to find new things. He enjoyed seeing people coming and going so he was not tempted to be a fussy individual, but he was very comfortable with everyone. He would have dinner every night and drank all the wine available at home for the night. When he arrived home after dinner, he was told by his family he would not be going to a dinner party at the party. Later that night, he was invited to a party at the front yard where he would spend a night. He would then come across a local chef to take him out with his family. He would then go to the bar to have dinner with his parents and his parents. My sister got excited, and after a few drinks at home, I decided to bring him out again to have dinner.","I entered a young man’s drawing room. His father did not know what type of work it involved, so I decided to walk down the hall. The younger man chose the formal drawing room and decided to let him explore. The young man decided to leave the formal room and enter his home. The young man started to go through his collection of materials and his room began to look more like his own working space. I began to notice that the people who were walking through the area were sitting in their chairs or near their work. I started to watch the young man come down the hallway to his drawing room and heard him say he wanted to have lunch. When he returned to his sitting room, there were people sitting around in chairs. The young man looked for the young man to get a seat. The young man drank from a bottle of wine, got himself a few dollars and then sat down in the drawing room. I asked him what his work was and his name and age. The young man started to talk about his work. He then began to talk about his day in the family as if he knew his boss to be a man who was proud of his job. The young man gave a very eerie reply. He had taken an extra hour to explain the work to the young man. The old man congratulated himself on doing his job and that I should be getting back to my own family."
C2,"Adweek called for a review of advertising in a controversial report on the crisis in the advertising industry. The publication indicated, in part, that there had been little change in the industry in a decade. The report is in which the chief executive of the industry, Martin O'Donnell, expressed his determination to find a resolution to the crisis. Mr O'Donnell cited the report as a warning to firms seeking to cut costs, but would not, in fact, give it an immediate, lasting impact on the industry. In this report, he says the report was designed to prove that the failure of advertising to generate the growth advertisers had lacked the required dynamism to succeed. Advertising on trial is the main issue with the report. It contains both serious and constructive criticism of the report’s approach. Those that favour the report’s findings should immediately consult a lawyer or the public, who will be able to advise the court to take a firm’s view. Often referred to as the ‘Mortgage Rule’, this means that advertising that goes beyond the usual ‘conservative’ advertising style (‘low-profile’ advertising) is largely a matter of opinion, rather than in the way that adverts should be handled. Traditionally, the report provides the impression that advertising will result in higher prices, but it nonetheless risks revealing negative realities. A more effective explanation is that in the majority of these reports, marketing campaigns are targeted towards consumers rather than clients themselves. In this case, the report's analysis gives the general impression that advertising sales would be in a slump if the market fell by half or more than expected.","An advertising agency started in 1986, working on advertising in three countries. This was done in response to the slowdown in the US recession and the weakening of the US economy. The company had made a major cut in sales due to the recession of the 1970s. This company had lost about $2bn in sales but had no significant increase in revenue. The first quarter of 1985 saw a great growth in advertising spending. The U.S. was booming in early 1995 but lost $600 million. The recession affected some people who were already ad hoc in some sectors. The economic weakness of the US helped to weaken the confidence of advertisers in the US. Advertising on trial, on trial in San Francisco, was not a bad option. But advertising in San Francisco had to be on trial in New York City in January and February 1986. The most severe form of advertising was advertising on trial in New York in December 1986. The majority of advertising in San Francisco was ad-hoc.","It is clear that the first decade of the 20th century was very turbulent and difficult. But the 1980s were the beginning of a long period of changes as we have seen in global advertising. We began to see ads being lobbied by advertisers to reach their target audiences, which were only a small percentage of the media that they were planning to reach. We were also faced with the difficulty of adapting advertising to different audiences. With advertising being sluggish and the cost of advertising being higher, a slow start to sales was causing a slowdown in advertising. In the 1980s we began to see advertisements falling into the wrong hands. In the 1990s our advertising campaign sales were dropping from 12% to 9% and our clients' rates dropped. The advertising campaign was not in a position to cover the full range of problems that were emerging in the advertising industry in the last decade. It was in an unhealthy position to pay too little, and to avoid being exposed to the advertising sector. We must help people deal with this situation successfully.",The recession in the 1990s would have been a good opportunity to work in the United Kingdom but it never came close.,"This story concerns several people who are involved in advertising. We all know that advertising can lead to more success, particularly if both companies meet their targets. This article provides an introduction to advertising versus the advertising industry. If you work for an advertising agency the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. As a result, many firms have now lost market share.","As someone who had worked in the advertising industry for nearly three decades, I am familiar with all the pitfalls. I am a strong believer in this. What’s your main responsibility, according to the public? How do you handle a crisis like this? Where do you put your ideas? The public. In the past I tried to be like the shamans when dealing with these issues. I am an advocate for the right to use creative advertising methods in a public situation. My advice is to always make an effort, though, and make sure your ideas are valid. When you have one, keep it strong and make the best use of it. I am a firm believer that a strong and sustainable market will be able to be a success in the long run. Sometimes, I even have one problem or decision to make. I have to be consistent!",The company wanted to put up a trial on a series of advertising ads. There was a high demand on the ads. The company had to change its practice to include ads based on real life ad results. This changed the way advertising was presented. The agency had more control over advertising advertising as the clients viewed advertising ads. The company decided not to make changes or take criticism from the media. The campaign subsequently broke up and the firm was closed down.
C2,"The person writing the pact is a poet. It's a bit of a dilemma, but for poets, it's one of honor.",A young man had heard an awful lot about writing a poem. His idea remained elusive. He went to an artist friend and got a lot of advice. He tried to write in a different way than the others.,"The last time I talked about writing, I told someone about the difference between being spontaneous and being truthful. As a poet I thought about the difference between being spontaneous, not the outcome of an experiment. If I told them how to write poetry I would tell them the truth.","You need to if you want to tell people how to write. In fact, that is a question that will be asked later in the series. Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face.","A teacher and students all try to be spontaneous and make a difference. One day, she tells them to take some time on their hands and a pen. Then she tells them to write, and later they go back and write.","An idea to tell an adult how to write a poem is a bit like frolicking through a minefield. Let's say the phrase, ""forks and forks, mrs.",By the time you have read many poems I was ready to take an art class at the new school. My teacher helped me learn how to write poems. I began by explaining the prose of my poems and some of the etymology of the poems. Then the teacher explained what the prose was about and started to share the poem with the class.
C2,"Do-it-yourself literary criticism is all about the 'free' self. But it is important to know the practical side. Online literary critics use the Internet as an outlet for self-criticism. Online critisism was popular in the late 1990s and 1990s because it allowed for the publishing of books. People are willing to think anything, even simple ones, and it was the norm at the time. Do-it-yourself literary criticism allows for open access to the Internet and can be a great way of getting a few books published. Online literary critique may be useful for free access to literature. However online literature is only available online. It isn't the only way you can get a snippet of literary criticism. Many readers think online literary criticism should be limited to free access. Do -it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun?","It was hard to become famous when a publishing company started making a manifesto online. I can explain why, because I have nothing to do with any business of publishing online. My job as an editor was to use a draughtsman to write a critical piece. I then started a blog about literary criticism online. The draughtsman came up with an idea and started writing in the hope that one day somebody would help them. As she started, the draughtsman started to have the urge to change things around. He had to think about how much it would take to create a book. When a publisher started publishing a manifesto, it wasn't easy. He made some good points about what the publishing company was like and then tried to change it to some kind of popular opinion. His draughtsman told him that it would take at least three years. And if the publishing company had time to do so, the draughtsman would be the one to write his manifesto. Then he started thinking about how the publishing company could better help customers by adding some technical know-how to their productions. When the publishing company received his first book, he thought to himself ""This is just an experiment. The money I’m offering to print is going to the printing company"" because he has his own ideas for the market. I started working on the online marketing plan and started advertising and publishing as my job. He started posting the content on the Internet and eventually he went to business. But when the website started generating traffic, he lost it. He then created a new site and renamed his current project. His name was published in a website by a publishing company called ProRepublic. By renaming the website ProRepublic, he made a name for himself and draughtsman was a draughtsman.","On the Internet, there was a great deal of information, all but a few of which were censored. It may seem a strange concept, but online literary criticism was actually a fairly easy way of bringing it to the masses. Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? By using Web design to criticize the opinions of others. The Web has been a fun thing in the past, but what else can a web designer do?","Web 2.0 is an Internet 2.0 project that aims to provide a more streamlined way to cite and organize information to users. The project aims to make it easier for people to access online content. For this project, a Web 2.0 blog was conceived with the objective of making the Internet easier for people to use, especially if they were unfamiliar with the technology. Students are encouraged to create their own blogs using a number of methods, including creating an open source version of their online publications. They hope to be more informed about how they publish their content, and how they communicate their ideas to the wider world.","On September 17, 2014 a new book was posted online. It is called ""Like a Novel"", and is a nonfiction book with a few essays to do. It was written by one of the authors of ""Like a Novel"", and is based on his/her own work. An author or an editor has not yet published his or her work on the Internet yet, and there may be many books on the Internet that have been written in the past. The book is about a fictional character whose author tells us some controversial news stories about his/her character. In his/her work, the novel addresses the issue of identity and identity. It is called ""Like a Novel,"" and it is based on the novel of the same name by the author. The author says that he/she finds the novel interesting and uses it as inspiration for his/her own work. A recent article in the New Yorker suggested that one of his most popular books is ""Like a Novel,"" and that he/she may not be able to publish an essay in that form yet, and that he/she may not be publishing an essay. Those of you reading the article will understand that the text explains a bit of the background to the novel. The main idea of this article is that online literary criticism will have more than just harmless fun. Many writers are trying to get their work into print, and you can tell them what your view is.",Online literary criticism was a popular subject in the 1990s. It was about publishing a book. The Internet was a place to sell books. People now write letters and have access to other information. There was nothing to do about the lack of knowledge that was needed at first. A basic book was re-edited for more popular use and published. The Internet is an interactive art. Using the Internet is an unforgiving act.,"A young journalist, needa, and her friend steve found it funny to read literary critics' views about how books and online media were interconnected. The re-enactment of this theory from a different point of view led to a series of criticisms that were able to be readily available on the Internet. One example of this criticism arose in The New York Times on the Internet. This was an article by the critic, needa. This article argues that there are a multitude of issues that need to be addressed in the online literary debate. An example is a book that discusses the author's take on writing, stating that he would have to critique every article that came to be considered by the crittor. To the original story, one of the students in her class was asked if the novel's style reflected what the literary critic said. The answer was an explanatory statement."

Lily knew her sister couldn’t keep up with her little brother Chen as she was very short. So Chen bought her a bicycle that she could drive along and make a secret. Lily knew she would drive all the way to Chen for the train station that was supposed to take her to see Chen’s sister. That didn’t work out! Lily eventually got a ride on Chen’s pony car. On the way back home Chen and Lily realized that Chen had told the two of them that they had been driving for a few years. So she reluctantly followed him, but her mother got hurt and finally caught her driving. The two sisters were able to drive on Chen’s bike, which took her almost a year and gave her a chance. Lily then went around the allotments and railway and gasworks in a strangely-coloured environment. Lily was driving on her friend Chen’s pony car.

She told them a few stories about the city's landmarks. When she realized there was no one in town to see the sparkler ring she made a surprise for them. At first she loved the place, but eventually she realised that it would be better for her sister to see Chen and his sister. Then, Lily fell in love and he began to take care of her. So, she got Chen to make her a ring. Lily drove on the road and stopped to give Chen a picture, but Chen refused to take any of the pictures. The next day Chen walked in and she was standing in the road, in his car, to give the picture to her sister and their brother, or Chen, to get a photo for them. Lily had left after his sister’s joke. She decided to drive with Chen instead of Chen, rather than her sister, so Chen let her drive around the city. Chen then walked outside and the story turned out fine. Chen sounded sorry, but Lily hoped for a happier ending.","Lily had a surprise birthday party for a young girl. The party was a fricking party for the girls, and the party lasted for three hours!

I wore the black pair of boots in a cowboy costume on the rocks. I also wore the black one when I went to hike in a desert.

I'm not saying that I'm a cowboy, but I have to be true.",I was in school and was visiting with a class. I was wearing a jacket and t-shirt. I walked past all the cowboy buildings.

I thought I might be a cowboy.,"I was wearing big boots and I couldn't get them off, so my parents thought I'd make them a new pair. I came out to them. They had bought the old boots. And I bought a hat. But then the rain began. When I stood in my boots I didn't have money in my pockets! The rain fell so hard on my face, I stopped walking, not walking. My mom took me back home to my mom's apartment and she bought me boots too. Now I know I didn't have money, so I went home to take her home.",I wore cowboy boots on the rocks to the camping event.

C2,"As birds are worshipped the world has always had a lot to say about human culture. But what does that say about us?Paul Evans reports The story was told by Robin Williams, a photographer from Washington D.C.A.. The wren is part of a family of wrens who call themselves the wrens. They live in the house, but are often mistaken for butterflies and gorsts. Robin's new home has no windows and there are not any windows. There is no security, only a raft of birds fluttering from their wings. In one case, two tiny butterflies are flew into their nests and they take care of them. Robin's new home is a huge bird to take care of, so to speak. The house 'flies into the air and is about to make itself heard', because the buzz of its visitors causes it to buzz. But it's only a small bird to get noticed and it makes an appearance by being a bird.","Paul Evans reports to the local newspaper and writes a story about birds. There were two birds in the greenhouse when he saw the wrens, a male and a female. Paul noticed that both birds looked so incredibly different. After the three-minute silence he realized that the wrens were just a pity they had not gone to the conservatory. The answer: a wren.","Paul Evans reports from Washington, D.C. A bird appears in a greenhouse during the holiday season, making the temperature on its flight warmer. A swarm of flies make its way toward a vent outside its home. The bird comes out unattended. However, when it arrives outside, it looks in its back window in a window. The bird bounces on the glass for a little bit. After a few minutes, the swarm is gone. Then it arrives again a minute later. This time it looks more or less like a troll. It looks like the troll flew up the glass, causing it to turn the heat back up. Then it moves to another window. The next day, the wren looks down on the window again. There, the swarm enters the window and the nest is placed in it. The wren emerges in the middle of the window. It jumps out of the window from underneath it. It reveals itself to be the wren, and then flies away into the outside of the window. He then returns to the front porch to make the noise of the nest. The wren then finds it outside the window and tries to attack it with its feathers. The wren flees out and attempts to escape, but then it tries to get out of the window by jumping down the window. This is the bird that most closely follows the bird, but does not get the signal. The flight is then reversed again as it catches sight of the new flight from above.","The human culture has always had a lot to say about birds, but what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports. There's a bump bump bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird a bird of portent augury and divination.","If you like birds and think they have magical powers, this is a good place to start. There are two birds: the blackbird and the whitebird. They both appoint people to live with them and bring them home from the woods. Is the whitebird beautiful or is the bluebird beautiful? The redbird can become shy and can climb bushes without a guard. It is very common for whitebirds to be timid and afraid of whitebirds as well as other birds. There are also a few bluebirds who come into the garden to attract visitors. Is the blackbird beautiful or is it just a bird with a purple tail, who is a kind of wry bird? The answer is yes.","Paul Evans was driving in a rainstorm with his girlfriend and wife. He noticed a wren coming around his garden. He thought he would snap at its chance. Unfortunately a wren came up behind them. He realized he couldn't wait to take a picture. He walked into the front door, opened the back door and looked at the bird. It appeared to be a beautiful bird. The only thing he could see were white wrens and fluttering feathers. He then scurried away, walked outside and walked for a while. The day was far from over.","The wrens are curious about our human cultural and scientific heritage. So, we have a story about humans living in our environment with our bird family. They are in the forest and they gather up nectar and food and, in the afternoon, they lay eggs in their nest. Occasionally, this bird does the eggs of its family so humans aren't at all fooled by their natural habitat. Now, the squirrels want us to look at their natural habitat and try to help the squirrels find their food. After the squirrels find themselves in the greenhouse and swarming and eating something, their nest is torn open and their nest is torn open. The squirrels are scared of the other birds as well, but they decide to help the squirrels. There was one squirrel who was so scared that he had to run with them to get out of the greenhouse."
C2,"Joanna MacGregor made her debut as a concert pianist in 2002. She started writing books for children in her spare time. She has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. But now that she has added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano, it’s easy to see why.",Joanna MacGregor was just beginning to study piano at her new school. Her fumbling with the piano became so bad she lost a few notes. But soon she started taking the lessons. She is an artist and has played piano with a teacher before and is a successful pianist. Her book has included lessons on basic piano skills and how to keep your fingers on the music while you're practicing. When she came to California she took the piano and she is still learning. Toward the end of the year she wrote a mnemonic page in the school library about how she wants her children to learn to play piano.,"Joanna MacGregor is a musician who has an amazing talent and has written a number of books. Her last book was entitled, “Joanna’s Lessons” which will be for children aged 4 to 16. The book also includes activities for young children to learn in different genres. The book begins with a brief introduction to Joanna’s books and details her own career. After reading many of her books, Joanna’s Lessons is now in its first edition.","Joanna MacGregor is a children’s pianist who has developed a passion for piano. In fact, she recently started writing her first books about music. They are all about what she's trying to teach in a concert setting. What they teach are how she develops a musical vocabulary that works on her piano. What her work really involves is how she writes music for young children that are excited to learn. Joanna's Lessons is a series of books for young children that she wrote on her computer. Each book starts with a lesson and culminates with a rousing performance. The first part of the series concerns the difficulty of the song and its placement. This gives the child some clues about what the pianist is practicing and the importance of reading. They then focus on the song and the instrument itself. After the first part of the series, Joanna, her mother, and her school professor begin singing the song. The teacher explains that if one has a musical problem that does not occur immediately, the child might be too bored to sing. The students then become more interested in the piano itself, learning what instruments it comes with. The teacher explains that this technique works well in the classroom. In the musical world, this is a common denominator. She describes that the pianist learns the notes of the musical scale by repeating the scale in a single beat. The children then learn to read the scale in large groups while doing so. The school professor explains that the song can be written in groups, and is appropriate for the students. The teacher suggests that Joanna must write this song in groups, rather than individually. The children then move into groups that practice the piece and practice it.","Joanna MacGregor is a young, talented musician who has played a string quartet for six years. She started writing books for young children as a piano instruction assignment. She began writing a book to teach young children. The children in her class are all very different. When she starts writing for them, the children begin to understand the piano. When she tells them her story, they say it is the “perfect book”, as she said with a smile. The children then learn a new trick or phrase, and become friends with their favorite music. The children in the class are much more willing to learn the same trick.","Joanna MacGregor has just completed a year of piano studies. This year she is planning to create a series of appointments on the piano for children of varying ages. Appointments will be announced on May 5th. The children of varying ages will participate in her performance. For the upcoming exams, the children of varying ages will be allowed to sing a song.",Joanna MacGregor is a concert pianist with a hectic schedule. But her work at the concert has been interrupted by her child with a severe hearing problem. So Joanna has a new task of writing books for young children learning the piano.
C2,"I was editing my essay for film about a documentary. I had a camera-ready notebook that had my writing in hand. One minute the camera had been turned off, another two minutes, still on and the book's editor scanned through to find the first line of dialogue. What had eluded the camera as I read the novel was the script itself. As I was working on the film the editing began to speed up and the story flowed. My friend wrote a piece of text on the screen and it started to flow. Then he sent me a letter of thanks and a message from someone. I wasn't sure what to say to the editors, but it seemed the writing process was being cut short. I had to adjust a few things.","This novel is one of many to adapt from a television script for film. It's not a rewrite, but a very clear one. Each picture tells a story, and the author really must use to give the screenplay some depth. This novel was adapted for movie too, with a few scenes deleted. There are some scenes that aren't needed, but others aren't needed, which is very frustrating. The first scene is a joke, but the rest of the scene is completely missing.","Once I adapted the novel to film, it's obvious how much of the dialogue was redrawn from the novel. Once the dialogue was reduced, the story would appear more visually and easily understood. What you're doing here is re-writing the novel because it's too much of the dialogue. When it's necessary for film to take full effect, it's important to keep dialogue consistent, and redraw the dialogue. To accomplish this, you will need to edit some or all of the dialog in order to make the story even more captivating.","Every Picture Tells a Story is a story about a woman. She is in love with another woman, her childhood crush. When her friend asks her about her, a young girl says, ""I told you that you would like it if you asked me to write a story for a movie."" She turns out to be true as she is resentful and dismissive of the story. When the girl becomes a famous model, she is more interested in showing her that she has been in love with a girl from the same school. At the end of the movie, the girl discovers that she is not the same woman. All that is left are the feelings she expresses in each of the characters. The story focuses on the friendship between the two women in the picture.","Every Picture Tells a Story was a book that inspired me to rewrite it for my film. Although I was very unfamiliar with the original script, I had the opportunity to learn from the great Stephen King about rewriting and modifying a book. Every Picture Tells a Story is a drama that explores how to create a compelling narrative without rewriting and rewriting. It is a story about relationships in a complex world. Writers use a unique combination of style and imagination to convey details to a reader. Each Picture Tells a Story deals with issues and lessons in storytelling. It is a story about how to convey complex insights through storytelling and the knowledge that we all have in the world today. Each Picture Tells a Story tells a story about a woman's attempts to communicate the depths of human emotion. Each Picture Tells a Story is set in New Mexico, USA. An African-American woman tries to cope with her loss of her home in a small town. An African-American woman seeks to move closer to her home while resettling on her love of Africa. Every Picture Tells a Story is about the life of the author and how these two women try to cope with their own tragedy. One story chronicles the growing pain and suffering of this woman as she struggled to cope with her loss. The story touches both a human person and the world around us, and tells a story in this way. Each Picture Tells a Story is both inspiring and profound in a way that is both educational and poignant.","If there was one thing that is always frustrating when adapting a novel for film, it was a process of elimination and deletion. The best thing to do about this is to edit a scene to show the original plot and not be afraid to ask questions about that scene. There are many other scenes that would not do this. This is a problem many writers find frustrating when working with novels. One idea that I tried to avoid was to use a few scenes in a new piece of fiction. When I began creating a plot, it seemed to be a task of a very limited number of scenes. There's no way I could have removed all or parts of the entire piece of writing, and I had a hard time finding time to edit this story. To remedy that, I tried to combine two parts of the whole idea of the plot: the dialog and narrative description, and the character analysis, and then to cut out the rest. The plot and narrative description didn't line up properly as I was adding more and less dialog. The dialog was boring, and the narrative description was too lengthy, but I did use it to illustrate a central point that I never realized at the beginning of the story.","Every Picture Tells a Story is a true story about the human mind. It depicts a new age story of a world that is not the same as our own. Each picture tells a story of a new way of thinking about life. It describes how this new world is revolving around us. Every picture is a story of a new age story of how we can see our own lives. We can see our differences, what is important, etc. It tells us of things that we didn't see in the first part of our book, which is the whole story we tell in the second part of the book, but we know the world from the beginning. Each picture tells a story of how we live our lives now and then. The whole thing happens, from the end of our story and then to the end of our story. It all begins with a picture of that world and focuses on that moment. It shows us how everything will turn out. That we will have to let it be ours. The story makes our thoughts clear to our reader, the viewer, that we are watching, not being subjected to the details of the world. It is a story of the human mind, our world and our place in it, who we will be sharing it with. Every picture tells a story of how we must have lived, we will feel their reactions and emotions. That we're living, and the people they met may be strangers. They can be kind to us. We need to have the chance to share our lives and understand each other's stories. The story is very important to us and the story helps us understand the world better. Every picture tells a story of the human mind."
C2,"Chris was excited about making a trip to the ocean. The ocean waves flooded the house and he thought it would be great. The ocean was completely cold this morning, but it had been a few degrees cold in the summer. Chris said his first few words were: “the heat is on. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Now the heat is on.” Chris has decided he should go outside every day to save from the heat.","The sun will set higher on Earth in the next few days when the sun will get colder. If they get higher the earth will get hotter and colder as the sun gets cooler. If the sun goes up on a warmer day, the earth will get hotter. The warmer weather will change the temperature of the air. If the sun gets very low during the day, this will change the weather.

We know the world will be hotter for the long run. We know that climate change will have a negative impact on the world and that it will result in death. What we know is that we are about to die.","As the sun gets hotter, it may be chilly, but warm weather can affect the climate. As scientists and climate scientists study climate change, a warmer weather could mean that a warmer climate could bring some extreme conditions in the world. The following are some of the effects of climate change.","With global warming happening all the time, many people are making great efforts to keep the atmosphere cooler to help their plants grow. However, as the sun rises it gets colder fast. The heat is starting to melt down. Most of the world is experiencing this weather change. The Earth is likely to cool down over the next century or so. The climate will change, however. Most countries will be suffering from climate change. Global warming will increase desertification of lands and oceans, resulting in a decrease in biodiversity, climate change in oceans and oceans, and the formation of a race of dinosaurs. The dinosaurs will make dinosaur fossils and anthropology experts will find ways to save the world. Some people believe that the Earth will become saber, and others think that we may actually get a better understanding of the human phenomenon. The answer is simple. The more you know about this change, the easier it will be to understand the Earth will become to us.","Weather patterns in parts of the world might change over the next few decades. Weather may change over time, or be altered by a more dominant source of sunshine or cold air or cloud. Our Earth is getting warmer than normal this century. What is happening to our water, water and air? A warming climate may change the water quality of our water supplies and food sources, and will affect wildlife, wildlife, and people."

He takes a picture and gets another.","It is important to know exactly how a map looks. That is, the main guiding principle of a map is how close you can get it from the surface. As you move to an area and look around, you may want to include the topography, the geography, and the features that surround it. Often, you should not use a map to describe the location or even where the features are. As you move and look at it, you want to find what all the features are about.

They need to know what they are going to do with the map. We are going to make sure they understand the basic principles behind maps.,"A map takes an image of the Earth with a globe and shows an area on top of it. The map gives directions and points on the earth’s surface. When a person zooms into a particular area, the outline blurs out. If you zoom in closer to where something you want to see, the map changes position. This causes the map to move farther away from what you want to see.","The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth’s surface to each other.

Shackleton also did some expeditions before his career began to take off, he said. He was the most successful man in British history. Shackleton was a major figure in British military history. For instance, he was the world's most successful icebreaker. But he was also the second greatest ice climber. Regardless of the fact that Shackleton was never the most successful person, Shackleton gave his best to businessmen.

C2,"It was difficult to listen to music in Britain at home after the Second World War. But then the 1950s and 1960s started to make that rare opportunity disappear and in most regions the music became available in the early 1960s. With new music technologies, even though it was much less expensive to pay for it, it still required a lot of work. When a young man began playing music he asked his parents for financial advice. There is a particular music that would suit everyone, including youngster who likes modern music. Susan Hallam has tried to explain the power of music as a way of promoting their work. He states that by doing so people can listen more than they can to their friend's music. She says that listening to music can be very enjoyable - as long as it is accompanied by music.","Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work, at home and in our leisure activities. As a result, music can be heard in more than ever before. The radio has become the dominant way of getting information from a variety of sources, including news, gossip, information, sports news, etc. Susan Hallam, principal of the Library of Congress, explains the development of a new era of music. She explains how digital music will be used to record music for broadcasts. The music genre has expanded by three decades. As a result, a range of new materials can be used to record music and tapes and CDs. Susan Hallam, principal of the Library of Congress, explains how digital music will be used to record music and tapes and records. It’s a real-time information system with a great potential to make learning and recording easy.","Susan Hallam is an entrepreneur from North East London. She started performing music and presenting at Manchester City Hall and London's Metropolitan Museum of Art. During a visit to Manchester, Hallam shows how music has made up for a decline in visitor numbers. The exhibition showcases many examples of what music has brought to London over the past decade. In addition to a new sound, the exhibition explores the effects of music, technology and design in our daily lives. With her art group, Susan Hallam shares her personal impressions of music. This was a very successful project and Hallam explained how the new sound allowed people to take control of their lives and take charge of their day to day activities.","Susan Hallam travelled to India in 1927 to talk about her first album  The Blues Brothers''. She recalled the songs she heard as a child and how her mother enjoyed them. When she was about 10 years old, she knew she would never be able to afford any of the musical instruments she bought. Her friend Tomasz Ishakov was impressed by her musical talent. Her mother took her to the conservatory to see what music was like. As Tomasz got older, he stopped playing classical music. Tomasz and Tomasz started listening to music together as a family. Their friendship grew into a big family and the two had a loving friendship. Susan had a very unique sense of style and knowledge. The music had to be different to Tomasz and Tomasz and their families. But a major change was the evolution of musical styles. Rather than revert to the era of musical expression in the 1940s, they shifted to instruments and music. Tomasz was not able to find the pianos for all his music. A more refined version of the song was recorded by Jim Morrison in 1923. The result is a symphony which is still popular today. It is a popular song in the West Midlands and has reached a peak popularity with its popularity among children.","Susan Hallam has described what she calls the 'next great technological innovation'. Then Susan speaks about how music has changed with the changing demographics of age, gender and age. What's behind music? In recent decades, technology has been pushing for change, focusing on technologies that can help make music more accessible to everyday people. What can we expect in music today?","Susan Hallam has devoted her life to the art of listening to music. She is a well-known composer. She lives the life of music in the United Kingdom. She is also an artist whose style can be represented. We are not sure which musical genre her work is based in, but that is not what she wants to tell us. As music becomes increasingly popular it changes its focus on the experience of music. The modern day music player is an innovative new media technology. Many new music players come on stream. Susan Hallam is an important person to be heard by, so there is a need to learn new music. We need to learn new technologies in music, so we need to get an understanding of how technology is being applied in music. We also need to understand the technology if music is to be considered new again.","Susan Hallam talks about her work and her interest in music. They all listen to the same genre. There's been a rapid increase in opportunities available for listening to music through radio, TV records, tapes, CDs and videos - and now there's a rapid increase in access to music through multi-media techniques. The three aims of this talk are: Music is a great source of pleasure, entertainment and enjoyment. The future of music is about listening to music with the same interest that we have today."
C2,Summer is the best time of the year. I’m obsessed with summer reading. I am very much a book-aficionados. It is nice to be away from home for the holiday. I go to a library to look for a book. Summer is a holiday season with a large range of books to choose from. Some are easy to find and others are difficult to find. I love reading to help my mind and body relax. The books will open your mind to world events and events. If you want something to put you in touch with it. I am excited about this summer and reading to give you a break.,"Winter brings many unexpected joys, and the best time for reading for a couple of hours is in the evening. If I could give a great book to my two younger sons, I would. That evening I read about what it has to say about love, friendship, and life in general. I find it comforting to know my husband can read me books even when I'm not home. Then I will find time for the first time for reading. I will take advantage of this time by listening to stories in the library, and by going out to a book signing or reading the newspaper. You can also find stories from fiction or non-fiction to write about in your books.","We all look at the world with envy at a holiday. We all think of books and their ability to bring us joy. And this summer we get to read them. Our reading experience is more positive when people have more knowledge, or when there are less people in our world. Many of us reminisce about how we became ill as a result of illness. That way, some of us can make better choices as they go through our lives. We are not alone and we are often reminded of why we need to be optimistic. However, we are able to feel our best because of how we are feeling at home in the world, whether in a distant place, a country, or a town. Because people think of us as people and people can help us to understand and relate to the things that make us happy. This is a feeling that one could share and that this book would help us to make greater choices.","Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books. Reading books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large because there are fewer human types than there are people. In the age of digital and information, people can also look up how far a large country has come. Books may help us to relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people.","Summer is one of the most magical times of the year. Winter is also a time of year for all those who like spending time in the sun, in the woods or in the countryside. We can have a great time in this weather with all the friends and family, and read with the books we have on our bookshelf. But, summer is not just a time to escape home. We can learn something about other people's life. Reading books will connect us to new perspectives, interesting things and a positive view of the world. We may feel better at home because we have read books as we have enjoyed a lot in our life, so we can relate to their details. Reading allows us to find meaning in the world, to share experiences and to share with others. We can read again when we are feeling out of place in our world. Reading books will open your eyes to the world, bringing us closer to the story that told us something different. Reading helps us be less isolated from others, even if we know that there are people around us. Reading can connect us with our own experiences and remind us of how we live and interact in the world.","Summer is in full swing in the West Midlands. I had a lot of reading and it was a great day for relaxation. I also did my first book reading at home when I was out of town. Today, I got excited about books. I thought I would spend time reading and writing about all of them. While some books may have a different meaning to me, others have just been re-read. All of them are good readings. They are all very meaningful to me, all of them are about how things have changed in the past. Then, I did my favorite book reading. That was my favorite kind of reading. I didn't have a library book collection, so I was not able to try it on. I could only read a few books. I am glad I took a chance and decided to read all my favorite books. I even had a book club, so I walked right away to the library and asked questions. I was pretty surprised that I didn't end up at the library too late.","We spent a couple of days in nature. We walked up a steep hill and enjoyed the sun and the earth. We visited the mountain range and enjoyed nature. We found nature in many parts of the world and enjoyed the silence of nature. There were many different types of life. We will be exploring the mountain range in all the world from May to August. We’ll also be reading about birds in nature. We’ll be learning about the differences in climates, our favorite foods, cultures and the weather."

Many of these photographers are professionals. Sometimes these photographers take pictures of people at different locations.","As a child, a girl learned photography from a teacher. Her mother was a photographer before she began studying. Then she moved to a new school after her mother left her job. The photographer decided to give a small photograph to her mother as a birthday present. She decided the right camera to take. She realized she would need a smaller one than the one she had taken.

It was an outdoor photo shoot, and he took pictures of the big trees as they moved from the building. He looked out the window for pictures of trees. He then took some photos of the people he saw. John also took pictures of some people being attacked. He also took pictures of people having fun with the water bottles he was using. John took some pictures of children.

C2,"I just got back from London and had been in the car for the weekend. I had no idea what to do for a few hours before heading home. I tried to set up my shop with Maurice, but his friends told me that there was no way to fix the problem. I went to the boys’ school, but went to the girls’ school instead and had a bad day.

I thought it would be fun. I thought about my friends but they were in the car next to me. I realised it was no good!

C2,"I think that Vancouver is the coolest place I've ever walked around. It is in a very modern area, just north of Vancouver in Canada. The streets are pretty crowded, and the people are so shabby I don't know how to keep my feet that way. I find it a really relaxing way to get away from it all. My son tells me that the same thing happens everywhere. They often get out of the way and ask where you stayed last night. It's a very quiet area and the locals are very nice. You'll never run into anyone from Vancouver or anywhere else.","In the past, Vancouver is a large city with many different cultures. It has a big population of more than 9,000 people. One of the city's attractions is that everyone seems to enjoy it as they do in most places around the country. One of the most interesting things is Vancouver's cultural scene. Although Vancouver has many people of all ages and nationalities, there are many dialects and cultural differences that occur. One of the challenges for Vancouver's residents is the lack of access to affordable housing. The cost of housing varies greatly depending on the population of the city. The average monthly income for each city in Canada is about $20,000. Vancouver is a very large city and not very large.

One of the swansongs comes to life when the river carries an amazing weight. The river, which is a rainbow-colored river that rises and falls to the river and floats down the river at low tide every day. You can hear that the river is moving faster than the ocean.

C2,I used to listen to opera when it was very old. They used to play the music in the orchestra for opera. Now it is just second form and not theatre. On Monday I had the opportunity to listen to opera at the U National Opera House in Sheffield. My boss and I thought it was interesting to have something new and different at opera. I was shocked to learn it isn't. So I went along and went to the U National Opera House. I was really excited!,"At the opera house we often saw so many horns and orchestras performing in the orchestras. During a performance, we noticed that the singers were most notably involved and we took a very strong interest in the horns. The concert was a show for which we did well. We did a good job of hearing them sing. The horns were very popular in the 1920s. The horns played on stage and during the concert, they were very good. We were lucky that the horns were a very large success. The opera had been a popular choice in the 1920s. As such, opera is considered a first and foremost theatre.","In my day to day life I am employed in the music industry. I work in the theatre so the opera is a big part of my day to day life. However, I really enjoy the music but it is important to remember that the audience is so important and they are the ones bringing a musical to the stage. I have been in the opera industry for almost four years now and have learned that opera is in fact just secondly theatre. As I get older I find it hard to imagine that a musical being performed for the stage has much in common with the main musical performances. A musical is a big part of my life but it is a major part of my job to find a musical which is exciting and entertaining. The music comes first with great music but a musical is important. So I’m thrilled to finally have discovered that opera is and always will be the music.","I used to go to opera when I was a child and at that age I liked the smell of it, the music and the dance and the people there. It was a very pleasant ambiance and I was also in love with a great era when it was so beautiful. But when I was growing up I always thought opera was second only to theatre. I did enjoy both of them and after a brief stint working at u national opera house I discovered that opera is only second only to theatre. The music comes first and i wanted to make it better.","My family was having a party that night. I went to the pub and saw a man who sat down on a table for drinks and then ate a steak. When the party came up I told my aunt about the wait. She said that the aristocrats could not go to the pub and so they can come to the theatre. I asked her if she had thought that, although I can’t make it in the theatre, the music is first and foremost theatre. She said that she has been to other places and luckily we were the first. She said it would be much more enjoyable if you sat at the bar and enjoyed yourself rather than being the host. I asked her if she would like to sit in a table next to the kitchen where the party was. She said that she would like to sit in the kitchen next to the table next to the kitchen. Then she said yes. She said the place had a place for food and drinks and it was the biggest place ever. I asked her if she would like to go to the concert. She said yes. She said she would. Then the music came. I did not see anything bad in it. She said I liked the music but I wasn't sure how. She was thinking to myself, 'Oh my! I can see that!' Now i must go!'",I started out writing on a newspaper and writing about how to read. I found it easy to make a plan if it was a fun way to spend my free time. I started to write the story of how opera would have come about if it hadn’t happened during the school holidays. Until recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. After a brief spell working at u national opera house I learned that opera is in fact only secondly theatre. This is the best part of my story.,"I was at a theatre and would try to listen to the opera and the theatre music. I was so in tune I was shaking my head. I sat there in the last one, but then I threw on the old curtain. I decided to turn my back and see if I could listen to the opera and the theatre. The music was really the only thing to hear in my head. I got up and went back to the stage."

It is about planning development and planning for agriculture. The words that appear on the book are in a variety of places. The students are trying to see how the technology can make these ideas come to fruition. This is a hard task and very fanciful. Which is the best way for a student to understand the different sides of the field they are trying to apply to their field? This is what they learn in a class.,"The people in the news were wondering why TV was getting better. Well, the time has come to think about how hard news can be. It is very important to be proactive about this. But when I was reading a newspaper, I was surprised. So what was the most interesting thing to happen? I looked at the newspapers. The papers and newspapers and newspapers were looking at ways to improve the quality of life for people. But the newspapers and newspapers and newspapers were not interested in this. That is where we began to believe that television has really changed the world. Well, what we are really going to find out is that we now know that it will be better for people to listen to the news than to watch the news. So we got that. Now what would be the best way to listen to the news? What will be different for the people listening to the news? Will they listen to the news about something that is important to them or about someone?","When farmers planted wheat seeds, people remarked the way they would want to plant it. The soil had to be fed for the seeds. They used a traditional method. Now, farmers are putting plants on the market. They want to get as much of a harvest as possible.","The TV production industry had seen a rapid increase in popularity in the last decade. As most agricultural producers had branched out, the market seemed to be in a downwards spiral. However, the market was unable to support the company's growth plan. This was in line with the growth projections in the first decade of the 20th century. In this period the growing markets were able to sustain their growth to about 50 percent. The emergence of mobile phones, Internet, and more, meant that farmers could keep their production alive. However, these increased markets posed an even more critical hurdle in the evolution of the industry. With the number of mobile phones growing, farmers were now able to create more efficient production methods. As the market reached 50 percent growth, it meant that farmers could have a stronger output. The market had a better chance of surviving because of the growing market conditions. Because of the competition in the market, farmers had to choose whether they wanted or wanted to wait for new opportunities. In this sense, television could be an effective tool in a modern economics position.","One year, a bunch of crocodiles were bred and planted with the help of a bee. One of them started to grow and became very healthy. However, the plant couldn't hold on to its old leaves, the soil started to swell, the flowers started to turn brown, and the crocodiles were too old to carry around. The bees began to be too tired to carry away their leaves from the plant. Then the plant died and froze so the plant could survive. The animals started to feed the bees and kept feeding.","Two farmers in a rural area wanted to publish their stories as a talk book. After giving their paper, everyone consulted the book, both of whom responded enthusiastically and enthusiastically. The news comes to mind: the news has caused a major revolution in science, science and the economy. To be able to attract this audience and to have a fair share of audiences, it must have been the work of a great scientist and an idealist. Now we are going to ask: if there is a future that would be worth paying for and with a clear future ahead of us, can we start to take it to the next level? Is it really possible to live in the past and not live today?"
C2,"Frank Kermode wants to give readers a real sense of the craft of review writing. He has been reading and evaluating all sorts of books and journals since his teens. He has a knack for analyzing information, making and producing a vast array of reports. Many of his reviews were written at some point between the late 1980s and early 1990s. Then he realized that they should remain in print and could be distributed in a physical form within the last few years. Kermode traces out the differences between the two formats.","Frank Kermode tries to write reviews for doctors, but he can’t figure out how to properly use them properly. He comes up with a trite, boring and muddled script, with a great deal of vagueness. However, he will teach your patients. His philosophy of “progressive” writing is not that deceptive. He gives you instructions, and shows you how to write a proper review. His approach to writing reviews is sloppily structured. At first, it’s a hard job, but, you learn quickly and don’t need to worry too much about logical reasoning.","Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews, how they’re written and their purpose. He discusses how the practice of rewriting is different from that of submitting a book review. He discusses a series of tasks associated with rewriting a book review. He discusses a process used to ensure that the review is legible. The final product of Kermode’s series of interviews is a summary of how the practice of rewriting was different than its practice.","The young man was given a lot of practice. He was a teacher by profession and wrote some wonderful reviews. He was amazed when others enjoyed them as well. Usually, he taught a course in review writing. But when a teacher writes about a doctor’s opinion, he asks if he would give an excellent review. Rather than making a general statement, he leaves it up to the students to determine. If the review is objective, the author should be able to evaluate it. However, if the review is not objective, it should be a deferred review. Ultimately, a reader would be too interested in it.","Frank Kermode is the author of the “Staff’s Guide to Writing Reviews.” He has written about a wide variety of subjects in his writing. As a student, he was familiar with the style of editing review-writing, and he had a unique approach to making his reviews as authentic as possible. Frank’s approach makes review-writing a process that not only takes the work out of the writing process, but also gives the reader real insight into the quality of both the work and the review itself. As a professor, he provides feedback as part of a review-writing project at a local university. He offers a wide range of services, including a free online writing workshop and an online training course for writing reviews. As a graduate student, Frank focuses on teaching a critical and writing process. He teaches a critical review course at Harvard División.",Frank Kermode has written about how many times a review has been published. He has an active practice of teaching and shares his writings to people in schools. It is important for him to use his practice to make changes as a way to improve the quality of his work. He also writes reviews for an art journal.,"Frank Kermode is the founder of the writing-review service on the Internet. Frank wrote a large review for a magazine on his website where some of his readers were critical of his writing technique. His review went well and won a prestigious review award from The Washington Post. Frank says that his site was well received, despite the fact he is a very short active volunteer. The publisher was also proud of his works, especially his fusion of literary styles and art. He hopes this work will help other journalists to read his writing as a freelance writer."
C2,When the film Citizen Kane first appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst its alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness.,"It was in 1941 that Citizen Kane aired. It brought a lot of talk to the public. During the same time period, audiences watched in the theaters, the commercial success increased. When the film finally appeared on television in 1941, it did not reach critical acclaim. At that time the broader audience could only find out from the story. However, the film earned a huge buzz because of the ecstatic reviews it received from moviegoers and the film. It was not as widely distributed as the commercial success it had brought. Citizen Kane never made its commercial headway. When it ran for a little over four years, it still went off the charts.","Christopher Lloyd is the film’s head honcho, and is often criticized for his lack of character, but with this film he is portrayed in a very strong, confident light. He tells us that the film had been written by Hispanics, so it was made by white people for the benefit of their fellow race. Hispanics are usually seen in black films. He uses a white character in a role of a poor guy, where he lives with an old black woman. He also has a name that comes from his black name. On the other hand, his character is the most likely to look down upon America. He was born in an white race, but he arose from his experience in white movies. The film focuses on a white man who is treated poorly by his black folks. The character, a white man, does not appear to have had a family or a partner, making him an unusual target for his attention. Though he looks cool, he is usually uncooperative about anything. Hispanics and other people are generally considered a good target, with the exception of the white guy. The film focuses on a white man and its a white man named Roger Williams who is white. When the film is over, the subject is seen to be a white man who is more than two inches tall. It was the white man who showed the audience that he was black, and it was easy to get to him.","The film Citizen Kane was released in 1941 but it was delayed because of distributor’s fears about the harm William Randolph Hearst’s alleged subject would do to them. So the company changed its name to Citizen Kane. The film was released as one of the last big motion pictures in 1941, but the distributor refused to sell it. The film was called “The Big Bang” by the film production company. After its release, Citizen Kane received an average of 4.4 votes. It was the first commercial success since a film based on Georges Landing’s novel The Day a Bird Went Wild.","Citizen Kane was a film about a young man who was convicted of committing a crime. Citizen Kane was about a serial killer who was able to kill his victims and escape with his wife and children. After a short film called Citizen Kane, the film would become famous. However, the film ended up being delayed for a long time due to the distribution fears. It was released in 1941 in the late 1940s. A new director, William Randolph Hearst, created a television adaptation of a story about a young man who had committed a criminal. This adaptation was an adaptation of a short story by Arthur Miller. In addition to its success, the film became very popular on the world cinematography scale.","The movie Citizen Kane is the story of the main character and his brother Virgil. The movie is a fictional account of the American Civil War between Abraham Lincoln and John Lyman. The movie premiered on April 30, 1941 and ran for eight seasons until the end. When the film started, many members of the cast were unhappy but others liked the idea that there was no drama in this film. Although the film has been released since 1941, it is a great success and the movie has stayed on television all those years.","After the release of the film, the audience finally received the final shot on cable channels. The original film had been in the theater for a time, but due to the delay of release in 1941, it failed to make the big impact it had in theaters. The following day a large portion of the screened-off audience attended the screening as well. The film has been on many tv shows for nearly fifty years, having since appeared in the 1980s. The show drew its audience because of the critical reception it received from critics and producers. It is a highly paid entertainment show. The series was shown on many television channels as well. In 1941, audiences enjoyed a wide variety of films. When the film, ""Citizen Kane"", entered the theaters in 1941, all of them were on the box office. The film was delayed for four weeks, because the distributors were worried that the movie would be made by a film company that did not recognize the film. The movie’s success in gaining critical praise soon led to a commercial failure. After showing to an audience with a public condemnation and no commercial success, the movie regained its public consciousness when it finally appeared in 1941."
C2,"A woman’s diary was published in the newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, by Helen Hayes. She found it intriguing that breakfast was a cultural appropriation. The newspaper was founded by Margaret Cooke, a prominent novelist, so it was not considered a ‘New Day’ but a ‘New Day’. The name breakfast was derived from the Old English word breakfast. The British government proclaimed breakfast a national heritage in 1948. Today breakfast, now a form of cooking, is an evanescent commodity to the British public. The Daily Telegraph found out the infamous breakfast scandal in November 2011. A group of people broke up on a Saturday in a town in Norfolk in 1888. The paper claimed that the people were a British group trying to save money to send a book to libraries. Margaret Cooke discovered the newspaper, however, claiming that they had a long way to go. He gave the paper a thumbs up. The newspaper found the newspaper a story of a young man who ate breakfast. Despite the controversy, the Daily Telegraph wrote that it was an apt account.","The modern breakfast has become quite popular in England. What made it so popular is the fact that many people today have breakfast at home. It is usually a meal that has been served to someone who has a cold, sour or bloated throat, which is very important for a healthy breakfast. With the arrival of food as a part of everyday life, breakfast has become an absolute fixture in many British households. The breakfast revolution is still not over the top, but will eventually come to be a part of everyday life in our day.","The English government aimed to increase the number of health professionals it would put in place. This is done by the Ministry of Health in England. The government has changed the way in which breakfast is consumed. The breakfast revolution started in England in the 15th century after the death of Frederick, who went out to a conference. The breakfast revolution has gained great momentum in England with nutrition expert Dr. Janet Squire and her colleagues. Aside from nutrition scientists Dr. Squire and Dr. Squire, we are also aware of the importance of the health benefits breakfast provides. In medieval history, breakfast was primarily associated with breakfast but now breakfast is more prevalent in modern times. The use of breakfast may be thought to be an English term, but in the 1800s breakfast was not seen as a breakfast until the 1800s. The food industry has changed, although much of the British diet has changed over the years. Today, breakfast can now be enjoyed even during the coldest period of the decade. The need for breakfast has declined significantly in the past decade as a result of the rise in food.","In the 1860s breakfast revolution began and breakfast became the norm in England. The food industry was growing fast by providing cheap, nutritious breakfast food for the masses. The breakfast revolution was aimed primarily at the low-income classes and not those interested in the upper class. Breakfast and lunch have been used as normal meals for the masses with many of the same benefits enjoyed by the majority of the British population. The early breakfast revolution came to an end on 10 April 1864 when the first food stamps were collected in England. Breakfast and lunch have both been known to be a good way to start the day – breakfast was a common tradition throughout England in the sixteenth century and early 1800s. The rise of modern nutrition in England began as a way to supply the world with breakfast food. British breakfast was also highly nutritious compared to most other European and American breakfast choices. Breakfast was often served between 7 and 9 AM and was known to be the most healthy breakfast of the day.","In 1792, the health authorities in England started offering breakfast as part of their breakfast plans for the year, and after that the breakfast was often offered after the meal. The meals were based on simple breakfast items including bacon, toast, waffles, sausage and vegetables, and sausage or toast. However, during the first half of the year breakfast in England began gaining a bit of momentum. During the 1920s and 30s, breakfasts were more commonly offered in traditional breakfast foods. However, during the 1970s they were replaced by simple breakfast items like cereal and bread. The first breakfasts in England included foods such as pancakes, waffles, and pancakes from breakfast bars. The British had no shortage of breakfast-related products in the Middle Ages. Currently, breakfasts are a major industry in many parts of the world. Among these items are toast, muffins, eggs, omelets, toast, bread, potatoes, and muffins.","Breakfast has always been a staple meal in the United Kingdom so it is interesting to learn about how the breakfast revolution is happening in England. The breakfast revolution enlightened the government with a revolution. It is thought that breakfast is now becoming the health staple in the entire country that has been described. This news explains why breakfast remains one of the key items of breakfast in a European morning. In British literature, breakfast has been defined by the emphasis on healthy eating and eating. What is important for us today is the basic need to prepare breakfast for the body. For breakfast in England, it is not only the main health item but the main nutrient that we need to start the day, as well. It is an important ingredient in our diets and a very important part of our overall health.","During Medieval times breakfast came and went. Initially, breakfast was very popular. Early medieval English writers described breakfast as “comfortable, and delicious.” The use of eggs was popular in England. However, the breakfast revolution was overshadowed by the development of fried foods. In medieval England breakfast was very popular and food became tasteless as a meal. It was also popular in British history. Until then it wasn’t as common as breakfast in medieval England."
