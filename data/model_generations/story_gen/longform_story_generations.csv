A2,"Harry and Paul both sat in their cars. Paul smiled as he pointed out the road they would be driving on. 'It will be fun' he said. 'I think the first ten minutes of the journey will be fun, then it will get very dangerous.' Paul said. 'You've made it clear that you want to go. And besides, I think there isn't anyone here in Dante's Peak who will want to leave.' 'Maybe' Paul said. 'But what happens if the volcano does blow up?' 'Oh, that's OK.' Harry said. 'And if the volcano does go up, you can go.' Paul said. 'But I'll miss you and I can't leave you behind.' Harry said, 'I know what you mean, but I'm also a very loyal friend. And besides, you don't have any reason to be bitter. I'm only here because I want to see you.'","Harry and Paul drove their car down the road to Dante's Peak. While they were driving, Paul's friend Jack came to see them and said, 'It's a volcano!'","Harry and Paul decided to walk out of Dante's Peak. As they walked, the clouds of rain filled the sky. As the rain fell, Paul thought of a way to sell their gold to the other people in the town. Harry asked Paul to tell his father about it. 'Are you sure you want to do this?' he asked. 'Yes' Paul said. 'I do.' 'Yes,' said Harry. 'And it's up to the governor to tell everyone about it'. 'Yes,' said Harry. 'And I think that's what they want too.'",Paul told Harry that if they could make a deal with the people in Dante's Peak they would let them go. Harry said 'I'm going.' So Paul convinced the people of Dante's Peak to let them go. They made their deal and went to the airport. Paul told Harry that if he could make the deal with the people in Dante's Peak they would let him go.,"No Harry said. 'I won't go. I'm your best man and this town has problems.' 'Yes' said Paul. 'You are my best man. But you must understand something. After we go, the people here in Dante's Peak will stay. They have their shops and their businesses. You think only about volcanoes, but this is about money too.' 'OK' Harry said with a smile.","'No' said Harry. 'I won't go. I'm your best man and this town has problems.'

There were too many problems there. The volcanoes had damaged the town. In fact, it made everyone sick. Harry wasn't sure what Paul would do if he couldn't help. He looked for other things to do."
A2,"Einon Einon wore a cowboy hat on his head and a bow on his shoulder. He looked up at Sir Bowen and said ""Go on with your training Einon.""",Einon had a dream a lot. He said he felt the knight was telling him the Old Code. Einon wanted to learn from his dream. Einon started to follow the teachings of the knight. He was now a Knight of the Old Code. Einon listened intently as the knight taught him the lessons of the Old Code.,"Einon was a young peasant who was studying in Sir Bowen's school. Einon was a good student, and it was obvious that the knight taught him the Old Code. The knight was pleased with Einon because he was such a kind, clever young boy. Einon was also learning how to be a Knight of the Old Code. As Einon studied the Old Code, the knight saw that his students learned to fight with their heads. Einon began to understand the Old Code better. Soon Einon was becoming more able to fight with his heart, not with his head. Einon began to understand the Old Code and he became a Knight of the Old Code. Einon continued to study the Old Code and he became a Knight of the Old Code.","Einon loved Sir Bowen a lot. Then one day Einon fell and broke his wrist. He was very sorry, but he didn't know what to do. Einon started to cry and Bowen told him that Einon might hurt someone. Einon didn't know what to do. His heart hurt because he thought that a knight could hurt him and he didn't want Einon to hurt anyone else either. But Einon knew that if he used his head to win, he would get the advantage and that's what he wanted to do. So Einon kept his head down and he practiced fighting. But after Einon learned all the rules he needed to learn he fought with his heart.",As Einon sat around the table with his friends and his parents Einon said to his father 'I will fight in the old fashioned way with my head.' Einon was a very good fighter.,Einon was a good fighter but Einon was also a knight of the Old Code. Einon would never hurt anyone or be afraid to make a friend. Einon knew the Old Code because there was a very special sword in the castle. But Einon never saw it. One day the knight asked Einon if he could take the sword and have it back. Einon was very shy and did not want to ask his master if he could take it. Einon couldn't imagine why he would lose it. He never had any doubt in his mind. Einon took the sword home and he started to remember the Old Code.,"Einon was five when Einon arrived at his first master's house. 'I'm sorry Einon' said Sir Bowen, but he didn't need to say a word to Einon. Einon liked to be kind. So he would always do what was right, even if it meant doing things he wasn't happy about. Einon didn't know much about the Old Code. But he learned the Old Code quickly. 'Be careful! Fight with your head, don't fight with your heart boy!' shouted Sir Bowen. The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings, princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. Einon heard everything that Sir Bowen said. 'I'm sorry Einon,' said Einon, 'but I still have a lot to learn.' Einon thought about what he had heard from Sir Bowen. He then remembered something he read in the Old Code that he had seen in the Old Code. 'The kings of old were kind to peasants and the knights helped them. The Knights of the Old Code also worked hard and became stronger. The kings would always take care of their peasants and wouldn't let the kings abuse their power. Einon understood the Old Code but he didn't really understand what it meant. Einon thought for a moment then he decided he wanted to be a knight too."

A2,"The man had to stop and look round because he saw I was too small to have a foot big enough to kill me. He didn't really know what I was shouting about. All he knew was that I had a very soft little body. So, how did he find out? He looked at the bird that was sitting on top of me. It was about to fly off. He pointed to it and said: 'I see the bird is a pigeon. Why is it sitting on top of me?' The man looked at the bird carefully. Then he put the bird into the basket, walked to me and said: 'Here, sit down on the basket. I have a nice soft little body.' So I sat down on the basket.

Then he realised what was happening. Marco had been standing at the door of Silvia's flat all day, trying to understand why Gabriel had left so early. He was worried because he didn't really know why Gabriel had come to her flat. Then he remembered. Before Gabriel left, Silvia put on her coat and opened the door, just as Gabriel had come out.

A2,"I have never thought that the 'ailment' is from the village. The weather is warm and humid. Why would I get the illness, especially given the recent rain? I am sure the 'infected person' must be from outside the village. Yet, my illness is the first time that I had ever seen or heard anyone speak of it. The village doctor was a man of very low social status. He had very low expectations of any villagers. He was in the habit of visiting people in their homes in the village. It was unusual for someone to come to his home. I remember the day when he came to see me. The doctor was watching me from a distant room. He saw me shivering in front of the window. He said 'Oh, what are you doing?'. He looked back at me with his great white teeth and said 'I am sorry that you cannot see me. It is best that I not see you.' I laughed. He turned and looked at me. I said 'It is not a laughing matter. I am quite well'. He smiled at me and continued 'It is not a laughing matter'. He said 'It is quite well' again and I realised that I was not saying that because it was true. There was no reason for me not to be well. When I woke up in the morning, I looked in the mirror and asked myself 'why do I not feel well? Perhaps because it is the first time I have ever seen or heard of the illness from the village. Why do I not ask for his help? Why do I believe in the power of the village doctor?","After my illness became much worse, my mother sent me to her father's house to get some rest. I did not sleep that night and woke up with a severe sore throat. My father came to the room where I was sleeping. 'What is your problem then?' I asked. 'I think your illness is similar to the one I got from the village. The symptoms are similar. Your fever is so high that it is hard to keep your eyes open and you have sore throat too. Perhaps because of this illness, my mother did not let me sleep and the fever and sore throat are so similar. I can see why you would think that it was from the village. I am sure that I have never seen an outbreak like that before. I doubt if we will ever get anything like this again. What did the doctor tell you that could possibly help me? The doctor said that there was no doubt in his mind that the strange illness was due to the phlegmy sickness, or something similar.","Is this the mysterious illness from the village? Is it just one of the many other sicknesses that could afflict me? I was sure of only one thing. I had a headache. I had a blotchy nose. This was not a problem. But my throat hurt like hell. The only way to explain this to my GP was to describe how awful it was. It was really bad. I had to make it more specific so he could understand how bad it was. I had to say I would take anti-histamines in order to numb the pain. I had to take paracetamol to help with the pain. I even had to sleep with a spoon in my mouth so I could hear my pulse. The doctor said I should take aspirin - but he also told me to take no rest and be positive I had bronchitis, as the cough is caused by bronchitis and the fever. Besides, a high fever could not be caused by any other illness. I could only be infected by this mysterious illness from the village. It had no cure. And there are still a few people in the village who are affected. The only thing left to be done was to hope I would recover on my own.","When the village doctor finally called my father to find out what was wrong with me, I asked him if he had any news. 'Not really. I have been feeling very unwell. My throat is upset, my teeth feel weak, and my nose runs cold and stuffy. I do not feel any weakness in my legs. I do not feel any sores in my mouth, or any redness or swelling in my eyes. I am just not very hungry.' It was not the first time I had been told that I was not well. This was after I had spent two weeks in bed. When the doctor called my father to say that he found the illness and had sent me to hospital, I told him that I was not well. The next day I saw the doctor who had waited on the farm for a while, and he agreed to see me. 'I have found out a lot of things since I came to the village hospital' he said. 'I noticed that you have got the mysterious illness' I thought, and it was a thought that I had not considered. 'I must admit that this sickness is a mystery.' The doctor told me that he would come to me after the holiday.","'It was not the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. It was not something I could catch if I visited a doctor. It was not a cold or a flu or any other type of cold. It was something I had never been exposed to in my entire life. My parents have been very ill too. 'I did not feel well,' my father pointed out. 'As such, I did not feel the need for medicine. When my symptoms began, my mother asked me if I was ready to see my doctor. I did not answer yes. My father said that if he came I could tell him everything I was feeling. This would be difficult, even for an expert. My father had never heard of a cold or flu before. He did not think it was contagious. Even though there was a slight cold slap on my face and a bit of a cold sweat around my neck he would not think that I was so ill. It is a virus I have never seen before. There is no cure. The doctors at the university said that it would take one month or more for a virus to be transmitted from person to person. My father thought the virus was a bit too unlikely, until he spoke to the doctors in the village. The doctors also dismissed the case of the cold because it was very uncommon. 'It has not affected anyone else,' I said.",'I am quite well' I always answered. Why did I say that? Why did I not ask for his help? Perhaps because in one sense it was true. I was not in pain. 'It cannot be the mysterious illness from the village' I thought. 'My illness is now three weeks old.',"My father was always so worried that I might not be able to come back from my sick day. I had said that I was quite well. Why did I say that? Why did I not ask for his help? Perhaps because in one sense it was true. I was not in pain. The symptoms made it difficult for me to come home from work. I was worried about the way I looked. Maybe, if I was in pain, he would be worried about me and come and help me."

A2,"The afternoon is a popular time for criminals to break into homes, says Inspector Ian Saunders, from the Greater Manchester Police, who said: “It’s when it’s the most peaceful for burglars. “It’s when they’re feeling more settled, and as a result they don’t think there’s anyone around. “So they’ll probably choose the most populated part of the home, with the most people around and the most visible to them. Saunders added that burglars seem to relish the opportunity to take advantage of this, and make off with your valuables. He said most houses are entered through an unlocked door.",A British policeman tells a televised audience that burglaries happen in the afternoon.,"Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to shut the door or a window.","A man went outside in the afternoon and saw burglars in his house. Police said he was leaving his house to go for a walk when he saw a burglar huffing and puffing. Inspector Ian Saunders said: ""They are probably trying to get away, but in the end they pounce on the homeowner.""","There are no real surprises to burglars in the afternoon. The time of day they prefer to strike most often is between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., inspector Ian Saunders said. The main reason is that many burglars will take advantage of the fact that it is less likely they will be stopped by the police. For example, people will often forget to put up a front door or window lock.

A2,The Black Rhino was one of the oldest living mammals. It was discovered in the 18th century. Scientists think that the black rhino was named after its big white head.,"It was very quiet outside. There was no one there. All of a sudden, a rhino came toward me. It looked around for a moment. It then began to approach me. It then looked up and began running towards me. I hid behind a tree. After some time I saw the rhino's large body moving towards me. I then saw that it was very fast and that it was able to run through the forest like a lion. The rhino looked around. Then it looked straight into my eyes. I couldn't believe my eyes! It looked into my body and started to run forward. It kept doing this for over a minute. It then looked at me again and continued to run forward. It started to run as fast as it could and it had reached the top of the hill in the jungle. The rhino stopped and started running. It had done that for over an hour. It kept going. There was a large hippo nearby. I thought the hippo would get to the rhino and attack it. However, it stopped and just walked straight towards the hippo instead. At first, the hippo stayed still, but then he got agitated and ran away. I didn't want the hippo to get hurt. Finally, he left and went back to the hippo. I then ran over to the hippo. The hippo rolled over on its side and it fell onto the ground. It fell on its back. It fell on its face and screamed. The hippo chased the rhino. When the rhino got there, it ripped its skin in a few places. Then, a great white rhino attacked it and ran away. The hippo ran away again and came back to the hippo. It turned around and came back. At first the rhino was afraid but the rhino let it go. In the end, it stayed where it was and it didn't chase it. The rhino turned back and went back into the forest. It walked again towards the hippo. When it reaches the bottom of the mountain it started running toward the river. The hippo got on the mud and started jumping back up into the air. The hippo got scared and got back onto its feet. It then ran back to the river.",The Rhino There are five different types of rhino in the world today.

A2,"When winter arrived, the geese started to go south, but the young birds didn't know how to fly. Bill didn't want to kill them so he gathered them all up and moved them to a special area of his farm. He called them the Lushmen. Then they all migrated south to the Gulf Coast. When winter arrived, Bill took the geese in the truck and set them on ice at the border of his farm. Luckily, the geese did not die. After that they got to be very good geese. The geese started to live in pairs. They would not leave the flocks, but they knew exactly where they belonged. They were able to fly freely, and they were very well fed. When Bill finished moving the geese, he noticed that all the geese left the flocks with their new family. He did not want the Geese to be alone. They fanned out and the flock got even larger. The Geese lived happily with their new family. They were a great example to the young ones in the flock.","The Canada Geese had only just fledged, so Bill couldn't know how many they had. ""It might be hard to tell,"" he said. ""Sixteen doesn't sound like very many Canada Geese."" ""The geese haven't flown south yet, Bill,"" said the Canada Geese. ""Once they have, you will have to find a way to take them back."" ""It probably won't be easy, either,"" added the other two geese. ""Maybe you can take them back if you can find a way to bring them back."" Bill didn't say much, but the other geese agreed to take the geese back to Canada. They all went to a small farm on the edge of the city to get fresh air and warmth in the winter. They had hoped that by returning they would be able to save the young geese.","When Bill Lishman saw the young Canada Geese, he had many questions. He wanted to know what they ate. Bill wanted to know how they looked. What colors did they have? How many legs did they have? What did they sound like? What was their name? I asked Bill many questions to find out the answers. Canada Geese, like many birds, have a unique personality. Canadian geese have long legs. Their toes are long, like long snakes. Their talons are long, like large fingers. Their necks are long. Their beaks are long. They have long beaks. Their bills are long and pointed. Their beaks have a long pointed beak and long bills. They have long beaks. Their bill is long, like a tassel.

Their feet are curved.","The geese are the national bird of Canada. Bill Lishman has lived in South Dakota his entire life. One year, he bought a farm with sixty acres and raised twenty-five animals. Each year, he brings his cows in when there is a long winter and he gives them to the geese. His family believes this is a very good way to help the geese out. Each spring when Bill pulls the cover over the pens at the end of the row, he sees the geese. He then lets the geese free to roam on the farm. Sometimes, the geese go for walks through the woods on his property. But, sometimes, they hide on the side of the road. When Bill found the young geese, he decided to call the sheriff to see what he could do. During the next few days, he noticed they were catching and eating grasshoppers. The sheriff said he had to do something about the geese catching and eating grasshoppers so that they would be healthy and strong for the next summer. The sheriff told Bill that the Canadian Geese needed to fly south to survive the winter. Bill agreed to go to the sheriff’s office and ask the police to put the young geese in a pens near his farm. The sheriff told Bill to wait until summer so that the geese can eat grasshoppers. Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. The geese are the national bird of Canada.","Canada Geese are large blue and white birds.

His neighbours saw the geese and decided to build a nest for them. Bill is happy to have a large family of geese on his farm now.",Bill saw the geese this spring. He had to take a few pictures of the birds to remember them.,"CANADA GEESE Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer.

They could stay on his farm, where the weather was still warm."

A2,"No one had seen a man alive on a beach. Serrano thought about his life so far and wondered about the other sailors who went to the island to help him. But then he thought of the woman who swam all that way to save him. Her name was Helena. She knew that the other sailors were dead. She knew she didn’t eat fish, she didn’t dance, and she didn’t eat turtles. She had a baby girl who lived next to her on the beach. She thought about her when she woke up a few hours later. It was a hot day, and her breasts were hot when she got up and poured water over herself. It didn’t feel like winter, but like summer when she lay on the beach reading a book. She walked out onto the sand with her daughter and watched Serrano as he gathered up his courage to get up. Helena had only one thought. She wanted to help him, she had a job that needed to be done in her village to survive. But Serrano had other plans. He wanted to save other children. He had a plan that could save hundreds of lives.","There on the shore he saw a very old man. He was sitting on a rock, looking back at him. He didn't seem to be very interested in what he was seeing. Serrano asked him: ""Why did you sit there, old man?"" Serrano asked. Serrano replied: ""Because you helped me. And I am sure you will help me again one day."" The old man nodded his head. ""Thank you for rescuing me.""","Pedro Serrano had a difficult life in his job on board the ship. It had been broken and torn to pieces. Pedro was hungry and tired and desperately needed food. He wondered why there was no one on board to provide for him. Suddenly there was a ship, on the horizon. The sailors jumped in and started racing for it. The ship stopped at the beach, and the sailors started to shout their triumph. Pedro jumped in and did not see the ship or the sailors. But he heard the distant voices of the other sailors and realized that there were still sailors on the island. The ships engine had been restarted and it was a great relief to see the ship again.","Serrano was sitting on the sand as he waited for the other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. He then looked around him and saw two frogs crouching in a bush. He walked over to them and they stared back at him. The frogs didn’t eat Serrano’s food, but they drank all his water. Serrano then made a wish and thanked the gods.","After a long hard swim Pedro Serrano fell onto a beach tired but alive. There was no sign now of his broken ship lost under the waves. He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. He saw a house, but he also saw a huge spider which landed on the door of the house. The spider ripped it open. Serrano was surprised. There was only one thing that made the spider crawl out of the spider’s mouth.","Pedro Serrano fell into the water, tired but alive. There was no sign of his ship lost under the waves.

A2,Sir Ector and his two sons made their way to the fight. The king was a powerful king. He did not want to fight the archbishop. Sir Kay also travelled with them.

They fought on horses and they got the victory.,"'When the time was right to fight there was a boy called Arthur in disguise' said Sir Ector.

The knights looked at the young knight and asked him if he had seen the real king. Arthur said he had not seen the king. Sir Ector looked at his two sons. He said, 'They are not knights, they are children.' Sir Kay said, 'But Arthur is the only one who understands my father. He is the King of the Knights.' Sir Kay said, 'I know that. I'm the King of the Knights.' Sir Kay said, 'I know that also. I'm the best king that the Archbishop has ever had.' The knights looked at the young knight and Sir Kay asked, 'What is his father saying,' he said. Sir Kay looked very sad. Sir Kay said, 'He is not my father.' Sir Kay said, 'He is the King of the Knights.'",Sir Ector was a very good and brave knight. Sir Kay was also very strong.

'There must be some other new king,' Sir Kay said. 'Of course the old king will come.' Sir Kay said. Sir Ector said 'No Sir Arthur, I will kill you.' Sir Kay answered, 'Bye'. Arthur said 'Goodbye Sir Ector, I love you.' Sir Ector said goodbye with a hearty 'Thank you for this'.","'Of course, the king is the strongest knight and best knight always wins. He knows how to fight. The people clapped at his victory.' Sir Ector was very proud of his sons. 'The younger brother is strong too' he said. Sir Kay agreed with his father.

I always win' said Sir Kay. Sir Ector was very proud. 'I have two sons who are strong as well. I think that they will also win the fight' said Sir Ector.","A noble knight arrived from the east with three sons. 'He looks like Sir Ector' said the Archbishop. 'He looks good' Sir Kay told him. 'He is the only son,' Ector said. Sir Kay told him. He looked very strong. He knew a knight when he saw one. He also knew a fighter when he saw one. He was a brave knight. Sir Kay's father would be proud of him. He told his son that he would support him, even if he was the weakest son.","Sir Kay and Arthur were in the battle. They were standing on their horse and looking at the other warriors. Arthur went down first but he fell first. Sir Ector came next and got up.

A2,"Peter and Frazer spent the night in Peter's room, trying to figure out how to make money selling their stories online. One night they decided to make a profit. They started making money from every video they made. Then they decided to sell the movies. They made the movie 'Stayin' Alive' about a girl who gets over the depression she had from her past. They also made a movie 'How To Get Famous On The Internet'. They made a video about a girl who wants to become a famous Youtuber. Frazer and Peter spent all their time making money online. A few days later they sold their video. After a while they got a lot of people to watch it. But they never made a lot of money. Peter and Frazer are already thinking about how they can make more money online.","Getting ready for bed one Saturday morning, I saw Peter working on his laptop. I felt a chill through my whole body. Peter turned to me and said, ""I really want to go fishing this weekend, but I'm not sure that my mom will let me take my mom and dad out."" I knew immediately that it was not something that would let us spend a beautiful weekend at the lake. But I also knew that I didn't want to leave my friends. I wanted to show them that we can go fishing, and I knew that Peter would also be there. I asked Peter if he had thought of it. ""No, I don't think my mom would let us go fishing. I'm not sure how we can get permission from our parents.""","During one of their boring computer sessions, Peter came up with a great idea. It was to build a remote controlled drone. So, one weekend in December, they took it to the lake and hooked it to their trailer. And on Christmas Day, they watched it fly over their house. “What were you thinking?” asked Peter, as he looked around at all the excitement and the excitement of this great idea. “It’s a great idea!” he laughed. “Why can’t we do it? We’ve all seen them in action, right?” said Peter. ""Sure. You know I would love to do it.” ""Thanks, but no thanks. No thanks,"" replied Frazer. “I’ll just have to make it a surprise.” “Well, it wouldn’t be as great if we couldn’t take it, but it’s fine,” he added. “It’s not like we’re making a movie.” Frazer and Peter agreed, and started to pack up their things.","The next day, Peter and Frazer were talking when Peter said, ""I've been sitting in your room working on my project for the last few weekends. Have you ever thought about having a sleepover so you can watch some TV, or to go fishing or swimming?"" Frazer asked, ""Yeah, I think I could sleep over so I can watch TV..."" The next night, they stayed up late, finishing Peter's project, and they had fun watching TV. Later that night, they were both really tired, so they went to bed early.","It’s so quiet that nobody knows they’re there. Frazer and Peter haven’t even eaten together this weekend. But they have a brilliant idea. They want to spend all their time working on this website. They have spent months getting the design exactly right.

The site would be easy to navigate, have fun to look at, and help people understand the value of local businesses. But they couldn’t imagine it unless they saw it in action. So, they are bringing their ideas to reality with an online crowdfunding campaign. They are asking for financial support to enable people to access and experience the site, which they will use to run the website. As part of the project they need to raise thousands of dollars.

He would dance for his girlfriend on the dance floor, and how he and his friends would often dance to the music he loved.

A2,"As Obama's mom told him, he had a life, and that he could never have the life that his father had. The next year, after high school, he graduated from law school and started a new life in Hawaii. In 1984, he became a U.S. Senator from Hawaii, representing the first state he entered in 1986, then his home state of Illinois. In 1989, Barack Obama became the 44th President of the United States.","Obama was just seven years old when his father died. Obama Sr. was a police officer. He lived in Kenya at the time, working for the State Security Service. The next time he would visit his mother in Chicago. A few days after the phone call, the next time he would see her, he would take him to a funeral. And for the first time in his life he would understand why his father was so upset.",Obama has no idea what he should do now. He is a young lawyer. His parents hoped for him to become the next president of Kenya. They hoped he would prove to the world that his father was the one who had wanted to become President of the United States. He doesn't even know if his mother is okay. He is too upset to think about her right now. He would like to get over his anger with his dad. And he wants to get over his anger with his dad. He thinks that the best thing he can do is to tell the world that his father is dead. He wants to prove to the world that he is the right man for the job.,"The first thing Obama said to the stranger was, ""It is my Dad. My Dad died when he went off the road and into a tree. You are not going to believe me, I know it doesn't feel real. The world was looking at me in a very different way. ""It is not my Dad who is dead; it is me who is the victim,"" Obama said. Obama's eyes flashed with tears as the story told in detail, with pictures of his father on the phone, a candle burning and his mother looking at him. The next day, he rushed to the hospital. It was late in the afternoon and he told his mom he couldn't leave home. But that didn't stop him from putting one foot in front of the other. ""I will get back to you"" he said. He started taking care of his mother, the two of them bringing her to visit her son's family in Chicago, Illinois. As he got older and wiser, his mom was even more determined. ""You know it's me"" she said, smiling and giving him a hug. She also helped him find jobs. Even as the news sunk in, he and his mother continued to talk. They continued to tell stories about his father. ""He was a man of principle and a man of hard work,"" Obama said. That day in October he started to teach and help organize the Kenyan people in his village. In February, he traveled to the island of Zanzibar with President Bill Clinton. They talked about what he saw and heard while there. ""He was a man of integrity,"" Clinton told them. ""If I could, I would make sure he would be the next president of the United States."" By the end of the year, the USSR was in the news again. After the war, the world was waiting for the next President of the United States to take the oath of office. Now that the election was over, it was time for the president's nominees to be elected. The people of Kenya had spoken. President Kennedy called the country home. The country was peaceful. So, the country's president would have to choose between two political parties-one who could be elected and the other that could not. They would either accept or reject the other candidate. With only seven months until the election, President Kennedy chose Obama. President Obama took office in January 1989.","Immediately after his father's death, Barack Obama left his rural Kenyan neighborhood for Seattle, Washington to visit his mother, who was working on a farm. He was a very young boy, so he didn't speak the language they both used. As he walked from the bus station to his grandmother's house, Obama noticed his mother was holding a large Bible. It showed that there were two people named Barack Obama Jr. and Mary Ann. One of them was a girl named Malia. In the Bible she tells you about God's love and grace. He says God gave Malia to me. She was the one who helped me when I was lost, and helped me after I won my own race. I owe it to her. That was how I became the president of the United States of America.","When I was in eighth grade in Kenya, a guy came and hit me and my sister in the back of the head with a brick. We were a gang of friends. We were in a house with a pool, so it was pretty hot. After I picked up the brick, he started to shove me into the pool. We did not get out of the pool until we were soaked through, but we did not get hit. He was dead. My mom was a lot younger than me, and a lot smaller in stature. We were just playing basketball on the court. I was so scared. We were so small. It was weird. I didn't know what to do. I thought he was a great son to me. But he wasn't. I didn't know how to deal with it. It was almost too much for me to understand. I was only four at the time. I was only four. I couldn't have it. In seventh grade, there were many African American athletes who had gotten injured, or killed, in some way. I don't know how you can be so sad and not realize that your father died. I didn't know that we had to take special care of you for the rest of your life. There was no doubt in my mind that you weren't going to go on to a great career. I wondered if the way that you treated me would have anything to do with you being president. I didn't feel anything. I didn't feel like anyone should care. I didn't feel any guilt about it. I didn't feel any anger. It was just this feeling in my gut that told me that my father was just gone. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go. I didn't know why people hurt him. I thought he was just going to be the father that I remember my grandfather being. I thought it was weird for everybody to be so sad. After that day in November, I started taking better care of me, avoiding contact with people I cared about. I was sure that it was because of my father's death, but that's not true. I'm pretty sure that if that had happened, my dad would've been very upset. My father was a good father to me and I think that he'd wanted me to do well. But he didn't understand that we were all hurting. I felt terrible. I wasn't in the right place at the right time. I was a high school student and I had friends in Kenya that loved him, and I was there. But that's not right. Obama did not have a father to help him. He felt that his father was just going to throw him out into the streets. He knew that he had to get over that. He said he'd come visit, and he'd come to Kenya the next day. I think it was the best thing that could have happened. The only thing that could have helped me is that I felt like his father was there with me. I understood, because I knew what he'd been through. And I got to meet him. It was a day when I got a lot of confidence. I understood that this was going to be the best time of my life. There was nothing that could've happened. It was not a good time for him. But he'd gone to see me, which meant a lot to me. I didn't know I could do this. I thought it could have been done. And I saw that he was. Suddenly my father, my dad, was standing in the middle of my world. I felt like I could do it. Even though he wasn't with me, my dad's presence had made my whole life much better. We were all going to get the chance that we needed. And we did. And we did. After that day in Nairobi, my dad got all our papers and all our papers got there. Everything got done. We got everything fixed. We got his body back, and we got the rest of my stuff. And I took care of him as much as I could. For a little over a month he was still very much alive. Every single day was a challenge. It was a lot to handle. But I believe now that he's there. So when things go wrong, he'll always be there. When times are hard, you just gotta keep trying. And no matter how big and bad life gets, you'll get through it. And every moment you're down, you just got to","One day in November 1982, Obama got a phone call from a stranger. He had a few minutes to find his mother before his uncle came to Nairobi to say goodbye. He called the emergency number, but it was not working. A few minutes later he got a message from his dad, and he called back on his mobile. He told Jane that his father had died, but he had no further information. He then said to his father, ""It's my father. I need to get to you so I can tell you more."" Luckily for Obama, his father remained on the line, so he knew what to say. He said he was sorry, but he was too upset to say anything else. He said he felt awful. As he grew up, his father's anger grew. He said he wanted more for his daughter. The first thing he did was ask his brother to go to Kenya and try to find his father. He told his father's friends that he was trying to get there. He also had some other ideas. His brother went to the United Nations to tell the world about the problem. When he returned, the president of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, told him that he was going to tell the world his father was dead. That was the start of what became a legacy. ""My father was born in Kenya,"" Obama Sr. told his daughter. ""He immigrated to America from Kenya when he was a teenager."" He said this to his father at the memorial. A few hours later, Kenyatta departed with his parents to Washington."

A2,"As time passed everyone in town began to mourn Jack Skellington and talk of a special occasion the Mayor thought of. The day his dear friend Jack Skellington was killed by a bat.

As the people of the town were listening, a bat took flight and carried Jack with him. The bat took a look at his friend and said ""I will never let this happen again! I will take my sweet old friend with me to the cemetery!"" People stopped muttering and began to laugh.

A2,"They all got excited and wanted to find out more about the old man in Christmastown. Jack looked at them and said ""Well, let's try and figure this out!"" ""Yeah, I think he can help"" ""Of course he can. We've seen the sleigh many times in the day and I know that he can."" ""And we know that there's nothing like that in the sky!"" The children were really excited. They really wanted to find out what Jack knew about this very old man in Christmastown."" Jack replied ""Oh, and I know there's only one thing that he loves. He loves Christmas."" ""But what's the big difference?"" they asked. ""Well, the sleigh is the biggest thing,"" Jack replied. ""When it goes off the ground, it's a massive explosion!"" ""So the sleigh really is huge."" ""But we know that's not the truth"" said Jack. ""At least we know we shouldn't hurt Santa!"" ""It's the biggest sleigh in the whole world,"" said Jack. ""It's a bit heavier than an elephant but you'd only slam it into another car."" ""And Santa doesn't hurt people"" ""Then why would he?"" ""I'm sure he would!"" ""He's a very nice man."" ""We should be glad to get to meet him"" said Tom. ""But we also know that he's very special."" ""So why shouldn't we get him?"" said Mrs. Claus. ""But we know he loves us!

""That would be a very nice thing to say to Mr. Fox."" Mr. Fox smiled and said, ""Thank you!""","I am sure that you have heard the Christmas story from your grandparents! They have all heard it, but many of them can't believe in it! That's why I made up this story for the children!"" Jack said. ""If you would like to read the story then you can open the book and then read the story yourself!"" The children looked very carefully at him and their laughter filled the room. ""And don't worry if the first page ends in a cliffhanger, it always ends with a great message!"" Mrs Gribble said. ""But I'm sure you understand the story! Don't worry, Jack, you will get over it."" Mrs Gribble replied. ""It's the same way I felt when my parents got married,"" Mrs Gribble continued. ""I'm sure you will understand my mum's speech!"" Mrs Gribble said. ""But what about your dad?"" Mrs Gribble asked. ""Do you remember seeing him last year?"" ""Then why don't you see him?"" ""Because he's dead now!"" ""So what?"" Mrs Gribble said. ""So he can't be real!"" ""Or do you mean it isn't real?"" Mrs Gribble asked. ""I think so!""","A very happy little boy came home. ""How did you know that we'd seen Santa? ""Jack asked. ""I see the presents stacked up, ready for Santa, but Santa still hasn't given us any of our presents yet."" ""That means you want to see Santa. Besides, he already told you that he's flying through the night sky in a big red sleigh."" Jack asked. ""And what he's doing next?"" The little boy asked. ""What?"" Jack thought for a moment. ""I'm sure you saw Santa on the way to school this morning."" ""Well, Santa isn't here if you're afraid,"" said the big man. ""Then you can leave your presents under your tree and when you return, he'll find them."" ""How do you know that?"" asked the little boy. ""Since I saw him in the park,"" Jack explained. ""That's the only time I saw him this whole year."" The little boy sat in excitement, then he said hurriedly, ""Look there, Santa!""","Laughing loudly, the little boys giggled at Jack's story.

A2,"London was starting to get bigger. People were starting to move away from the country to the big city. The city was starting to get dirty and many people were poor. There was a lot of talk about a new city planned for the city. The plan was to have a police force so that the city would be safer for everyone. The first policeman was named William Horatio Gates in 1704. Horatio was a very clever man. He had very good eyesight. He knew the streets really well. He also knew that the police needed to be trained properly. So Horatio decided to hire an old man, Sir Alexander Campbell, as the first policeman. Sir Alexander Campbell had been a doctor. He taught medicine at the Royal College of Physicians and later went on to become a professor. Sir Alexander Campbell knew that the citizens of London were very scared of thieves. He had been to London before and he had seen thieves before, but he had never seen one so he figured that it had to be someone very special. He chose Sir George Johnstone, who was the most famous man in England at that time. Sir George Johnstone had been a lawyer and he wanted to make sure that the citizens of London were safe. Sir George Johnstone became a rich man. Sir George Johnstone made a great deal of money because London had never had a police force before. His first policeman went on to become the first police commissioner in England in 1712. When Sir George Johnstone retired, his old friend Sir Alexander Campbell continued to work for him and later became the second chief of police in England. In 1714, Sir George Johnstone was promoted to Inspector of police at the Tower of London. In 1722 Sir George Johnstone took over as Chief of police. He was the first police chief in England. In 1748 he made many changes to the city. He made it cleaner, improved the road network and improved the fire department. He also introduced more crime fighting and improved the sanitation system. Sir George Johnstone was one of the nicest men in London. He was not very strict but he was very fair and friendly. Some people complained that Sir George Johnstone was stricter than Sir George Johnstone because he seemed to be getting older by the day. He was so nice that they gave him a title of Baron. He gave out gifts to his wife and children and made them famous in London. He gave his house to the homeless when he died. He gave his wife all his money and he also helped them to get a nice house. He gave away money and the land to the homeless. He also gave them a nice house. He got a big house for his family. Many of the people that he met believed that the house was great because it had a lot of land and a big house. There was a lot of money that had been saved for the future. One day when he was walking along the streets of London he saw a man with a long beard he called Henry Vaughan. He was a famous poet who wrote beautiful poems. Vaughan listened to the music of Sir George Johnstone. When he finished reading, he heard that the house was called the Victoria Inn. The Vaughans lived in London at the time, and they were friends. They had a pig named John Smith. So the Vaughans asked him to help the King in his city. He wanted to help everyone to have a good life in the future. The King was impressed by the new policeman. They named him Henry Vaughan after the first police chief. Those days, when people were afraid of thieves, men that had guns and the police were very common. The policemen also looked like they had a lot of courage and were very strong. They got very well paid because they did not work part-time.","The streets were very dirty and many people were poor. This is what made King Charles II want to help the people of London. In 1666, he made a decision: he wanted a few old men to protect the city streets at night. He wanted to do things that would make the people of London a better place. One of the first things he did was to hire a new policeman. He hired Sir George Fitzroy. He hired him because he could pay him well, but he also wanted to create an office where he could make more money. He even gave his wife an allowance of money every month. He wanted to hire a few young men because the old men could not take care of the roads. In 1700, London became much safer. It also started getting much cleaner. There was a policeman on every street. This made life a lot more safe and clean.","It was about 500 years ago that London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. One day, a group of businessmen came up with the idea of creating a London police force. The businessmen asked for help from many policemen all over Britain. This caused a lot of trouble and soon many policemen in England began to make suggestions. One of the new ideas was to have a city watch or police force. The city watch would be a body of men who lived in the city. They would check on the buildings and people in the city and any illegal activity would be stopped. The city watch would also keep track of people who broke the law, and could give people a fine. When the businessmen voted, they agreed to have a city watch or a police force. They started to set up the first police force in England. People thought that the city watch would protect people better than the old men in the street at night. The people thought that the city watch would protect people better than old men in the street at night.",We are very happy because London has many policemen today.,"In the 18th century London had a lot of problems. The police were not paid very much and they were not allowed to carry guns, so they had to use the old men who looked after the city.",The policemen used to protect the city streets at night. They were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. The policemen did not work that hard.,"Today there are policemen everywhere but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. The police started to look for people to be policemen and they took charge of the city. The people became very afraid of the policemen and they were scared to step in front of a policeman, which resulted in many crimes. Some people were robbed of their coats and some people stole money. They became angry and started to beat people. So, it was decided that some policemen were needed to look after the city of London, and so a public office was set up for the police to work."

A2,"The parrots are such fun to watch. I particularly love parrots because they can be so noisy and they make me happy whenever I see them. Parrots have lovely colours and long tails. They are found in many countries, like Brazil, Australia and India. The colour of these birds can vary so much – from green and yellow to dark blue and black. It’s interesting to note how the tail varies in different places. You might find some of the parrots in a zoo. The parrots at the zoo are also bright and iridescent, just like the ones at the wildlife park.","The parrot loves fruit. Sometimes because the birds eat all the fruit, they make a mess of the garden. Sometimes, the parrots eat the lily seeds.","It was summer time and there were a lot of fruit trees. One day a wild parrot jumped onto one of them. He looked at his friend who was also a birdkeeper. He laughed and said: ""Yes he can."" ""What are you saying?"" said his friend. ""I told you, we get a lot of fruit but the farmers don't like it."" ""It must have been my fault. I climbed up onto my tree and the parrot took off. I wanted him to know where he had climbed. I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere for my friend. But I couldn't find him."" ""The problem is that I have a long tail!""","Parrots are pretty birds, but unfortunately they can be a problem for farmers. They sometimes eat fruit, and because of this, they can cause damage to fruit trees.","A parrot has a lovely colourful tail and the parrot is found in many countries like Brazil, Australia and India. Parrots tend to live in large groups. Usually the birds live in large groups, but because they like to eat fruit, they are sometimes a problem for farmers.

A2,"Daniel Allsop is 14 years old and lives in England. Last summer he went to a beach holiday with his family. One day they took a trip to a park not far from his hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. We didn't think much of it until we got there, and as we sat in the shade I noticed something. It looked like an elephant. From across the square a single trunk appeared and a tiger stared at us. He looked at the elephant with curiosity before moving back into the forest. Daniel Allsop has been writing stories since he was 3 years old, and he was lucky enough to write a series titled The Elephant Show, in which he describes how he got his name. It has appeared on several publications, such as BBC Magazine, The New Yorker, The Telegraph, Wired, and other international publications. Daniel Allsop has worked on books, television and radio shows, and has been shortlisted for the Guardian, Observer and other literary awards, including a National Short Fiction Award.","It was early in the day and the air was very hot. When I saw the elephants we looked out over the horizon as we waited for the show to start. The show began with the elephants going on a big loop and jumping up and down. I was fascinated by the stunts the elephants made while they were performing, even though they could only go so high. The elephants looked very natural. After a while they went into a pen and jumped out. They looked very happy and playful. After a while they moved into a new area and then came back out. They were all very quiet with their owner. Suddenly an elephant ran into the pen. It moved into a new space and started moving forward. Suddenly there was a second elephant who came to the pen and ran into the middle of the crowd and then came back to the elephants in the middle. After a while the elephants were all together again in the same corner. They did some more tricks. Before long they were all gone. Then the show ended and we went back to the hotel.","The elephant show was a bit confusing for me because I hadn’t been to an elephant show before. I had heard lots of people talking about them, so I wanted to know how it was to see an elephant performing tricks. Then my mum pointed out the ear, nose and teeth parts of the elephant. Then the face and belly. There were big white areas under the nose and around the mouth. And the nose – all huge white tusks. They were quite loud! Then the big tusks. They were huge! But the ears – not big at all. I had no idea what it was like to have them around. Finally I got to see the two huge ones. They are like huge horses. They were huge. They were so tall and tall, that they appeared to be made of wood. I wasn’t sure if they were real. But they were massive. Then they began to jump and fall and then they started to dance with people watching. I watched for a while because they were really fun. Then they just started to dance. Some of them were quite good at jumping but they were all the same height! We stood up and all of us laughed. And then it started. The elephants started to dance and they were really funny! Then we got up and got ready to leave. I couldn’t believe it! We had a great time and I hope we go next year.","My dad went to the elephant show so I could see the show. It was a really funny show! The elephants started to climb on their hind legs and juggle their trunks in funny ways. They also performed tricks like balancing their trunks on one side and then jumping and kicking each other. It was a very good show! My friend Alex said that the elephants were amazing. There were a lot of people at the show but they kept very quiet and no one shouted, so nobody heard their jokes.",I went to the elephant show with my family last summer. We had a lovely time and my parents even took me to a Thai massage afterwards. Afterwards we all walked back to our hotel. I'm glad I went because we all had a great time and I'm looking forward to going back.,"The elephants did not really seem to like the way we were sitting in their enclosure. It made them look a bit awkward. They tried to go over, but we couldn't see what they were going to do. After they got over that, they all just stood in one place. We took our seats so the elephants wouldn't be a distraction.",Last summer I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. I think the elephants were pretty amazing. The ones you see in pictures are the ones at the front of the show. We also saw a lot of monkeys. After the show we enjoyed a delicious lunch in one of the restaurants in the park.

A2,"The captain was talking with Hayes. ""We just can't risk it."" The captain pointed to the hull. The captain went to the rudders. ""Wait, wait. We just have the same amount of water under our ship"" Hayes said. The captain thought for a moment. ""There is none at all!"" Englehorn said. Hayes looked into the water. ""Sure is"" Englehorn said. ""It must be a good six inches in there."" ""What do you know?"" the Captain asked. ""It's not much."" ""It's even less than six inches"" Englehorn said. ""That means it's under three quarters of the ship."" ""We'll need some men to clean up the mess"" said Hayes. ""We'll need help lifting things off the deck."" Englehorn nodded. ""I don't think you'll have any help to do this"" said Hayes. ""Not if we can't pull things free"" the captain said. ""Now that the rudders are wet, we can't move. That's why you're stuck here! Your boat must be full of water."" ""You better do it! If we don't, we'll have to abandon ship!"" Englehorn said. He took a knife from the back of his cabinet. It was a scythe. He cut around the block and set it into the water. Then he took the hilt off a pole and pulled it free. Hayes pulled out the paddle as Englehorn pulled the hilt back. ""There's water under the hilt. It's ten foot deep. It would take twenty-five men to pull it free!"" Englehorn shouted.","When it was time to leave, the captain gave the crew the answer. The ship had 3 feet of water under it. Englehorn and Hayes were still trying to find the answer.","There is lots of water under the ship, it cannot be as deep as under the iceberg. It is almost as deep as under the deck. Englehorn asked Hayes, ""How many men did it take to figure it out?"" ""I don't know"" Hayes replied. ""The ship is overloaded,"" said Englehorn. ""At first we put everybody in and then we put everyone out. Now I know how much water is in there."" He pointed down to the iceberg and said, ""What about the bottom?"" Hayes smiled, ""But it isn't there, it's just about to sink. There isn't any water in the iceberg. It's more than half of the ship. It must be impossible to reach the bottom without a boat, but we'll have to stop and get a different ship.""",Englehorn and Hayes looked at the compass that they had in their pockets and knew what they could do. They counted the water that came down into their pockets. When they came back on deck the sun had set and the ocean had calmed. So they sailed on.,"""I thought that was true"" Englehorn said. ""It looks like you know that now,"" Hayes said. ""You'll have to find out that for yourself."" Hayes said, ""I'll have to look around the ship for information about what's going on underneath the decks."" ""I'll have to go through them and pick out all the information."" Englehorn said. ""Then, we need to figure out how to use our instruments.""",The sun was setting and the captain of the ship couldn't see a thing. The men on the ship tried to sleep. By morning it was all pitch black. This is the only thing that Englehorn and Hayes knew about the water. The sailors couldn't see anything either. Suddenly there was the sound of the ship being tossed over the side. The men thought they had sunk but the water was just sloshing over the side. They had been tossed around so much that the stern started to sink. There were big waves coming ashore. The boats on shore had been dragged down the river. The men swam up the river to dry out before going to shore.,"""How much water is under the ship?"" Englehorn asked Hayes. ""Not enough to sink the ship"" Hayes said. ""We've already seen one man try to sink the ship. That was Captain Hayes."" Hayes nodded. ""We'll get him thrown overboard and give him a few days to get better"" Englehorn said. ""But I don't want him thrown overboard."" Englehorn said. ""So you say there's two men on board who've got skills in figuring out the answer to that question?"" Hayes asked. ""I'm afraid they'll try and sneak under the ship and we'll end up sinking the ship."" Englehorn said. ""What if the ship sinks completely?"" Hayes asked. Englehorn pointed to the hull of the ship and said, ""That part of it is very stable. There's no chance the hull will sink. You've got to jump overboard. But if you don't, you'll be stuck underneath the ship. Don't get us into trouble! We've got enough firepower now. I'll let the men inside the ship get out of trouble."" Englehorn smiled. ""Do you want to go in the water with us?"" Hayes asked. ""I told you you don't want to get in the water, but when you get on the boat you'll find out that we're safe."" Englehorn laughed."

B1,"At a large city in the Arctic, the owners of a hotel decided to put some of it to good use. They built an ice hotel, with no rooms, no staff and no electricity, just a fireplace and heaters. The hotel also had to deal with the polar bears, who ruled the territory for centuries. Before any guest arrived at the hotel, they had to clear the snow from the parking lot. They blew horns at the bears, who chased them away. After the bears were gone, the tourists left, returning the following summer. In the darkness, the hotel staff sat in the fireplace, warming their hands. It was a harrowing experience... They could barely see their faces. It was time to go home.","The IceHotel was constructed in 1986 and it is currently the only hotel in the Arctic to be open 24 hours a day during the winter season. The hotel is designed to be used for weddings, conferences and corporate outings.","He was at the moment looking at a map of the Arctic showing the location of the new hotel. The plan was to open it during the summer season but to make the most of the long dark winter. This was achieved by constructing a lighthouse over a small river. Its purpose is to guide guests on a walk across the river with light, a luxury that the rest of the world was not used to. The lighthouse will be illuminated at night only and must not be visible from the shore during the day. This meant a long and very cold day for guests to take part in the walk. Afterwards, the building was insulated from the wind and the rain so that guests could stay in the hotel while it was shut. The lighthouse is on the shore of the river but is far from the nearest village of Uljófen. It also faces the polar circle so that all visitors will see the same sunrise and sunset for as long as they are on the ice and snow. The ice is soft and flexible and allows it to change shape and tilt as it moves through the seasons. Light will also be projected onto the snow to give a panoramic view. The first guests arrived during the autumn. They were delighted with the location and facilities and stayed for a month.",The Icthehol was a small hotel in the Arctic Circle which welcomed guests for an overnight stay in the winter.,"The Arctic had always been a quiet place in winter but the Arctic hotel business was set to grow and that is when the owner, Mr. Borghetti, decided to build an ice hotel to attract tourists, who could walk on the frozen ground and enjoy the silence. Mr. Borghetti bought the land where he wanted to build the ice hotel in the late 1980s, just as the world was changing dramatically. Mr. Borghetti now runs the hotel, named – naturally – Icy Mountain, and his wife, Ms. Borghetti, runs the ice hotel. Mr. Borghetti says there was an ice hotel in the Arctic since the 1950s, when he bought it. Mr. Borghetti has built the ice hotel here as part of the Icy Mountain project. One year ago the Arctic hotel industry is still a niche business for Mr. Borghetti, but by building a hotel in the winter he wants to attract tourists. Ms. Borghetti and Mr. Borghetti hope that the two women will be able to make a living out of the business. The hotel, which is located in a remote part of the arctic, has a beautiful view of the aurora borealis. One day he was walking along the beach when he saw a strange-looking figure. He saw that it was Mr. Borghetti, and that he looked very much like him. He was about to leave when the figure appeared in front of him.","At the end of the 1980s, the Arctic was a popular tourist destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun, but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s, it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage.","A icehotel was built at a base camp in the Arctic. As the weather got colder a cabin had to be added and the hotel closed for the winter season. In the summer people used to go there to see the midnight sun but in winter, when the sun went down, the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage."
B1,"The north face of Ben Nevis is infamous for its long, straight and exposed ridges which are perfect for skiers and mountaineers. During winter it can also be particularly difficult and unforgiving. It may take an hour or so to get to the start point where we pitched up and spent an hour huddled together. Some people choose to slog along the ridges in heavy sleet – it's a good workout and the views are spectacular, but if you are planning to summit in the dark, it's not recommended. I arrived at the peak around lunchtime to find it a different story entirely. The climb started off pretty uneventfully: snow fell from above, so we got out ice axes and crampons and set off up the snow slope. I followed the guide's advice and slog up a steep wall of snow. But after a few slogs I got onto a sheltered slope and found my way down into a huge gully. A ridge appeared on the left, straight ahead. When I started to go around the corner, I thought, what is it going to take to get me to the finish? I had scouted the route as far back as I could and thought I knew it. I was quite worried, but I figured that if I made my way through, I could slog down to the final move. I made the second move, took a few swigs of water and climbed down. I realised that the snow around me was actually deep enough that a rockfall would be possible. I was still hoping it wasn't snow drifts because I thought if I was going to move across the gully I would break the ice so I didn't slip. The snow fell in patches as we made our way towards the finish, but it was well covered and dry. The second part of the ridge was more challenging. On my first attempt I skied down into a large gully with a small waterfall on the other side. It was snowing quite a lot, I wasn't sure how many feet of it. There were some really deep snowbanks here so I managed to get to the top of the drop and get some good photos. It didn't take me long to get a bit of cramponing practice and start sledging across the frozen gully and up the cliff. By the time I was back to the belay, it was over 100 metres from the summit – and no matter how much we took, I couldn't get above the edge. Eventually it dipped below freezing and we could see that the snow was starting to lift. The final step was about 100 metres more, so it had been a bit of a long way from the end. My partner Dave eventually got the lead and we carried on together until we reached the summit, just on the final pitch of the climb. I still didn't do the summit, but was just thrilled I'd made it and got back down safely without the help of crampons. The final pitch was more exciting though, because I could finally get onto the ridge and get my skis and crampons out. It was a brilliant experience. I'll never forget that day. I'll never forget it!","I’d been planning on climbing Ben Nevis for three years. We would attempt it one winter night and would base camp on top of Ben Nevis. We were planning to have two of us climb the north face of Ben Nevis. The mountain is pretty remote so there was a lot of snow, but we had a steady supply of ice screws. My wife and I took the morning off and hiked in the wilderness to a rocky meadow. It’s called Ben Nevis Burn. It is very cold on the mountain, and our guide had told us it could be as cold as 20 degrees Celsius. He wore shorts and a singlet, and we didn’t even have crampons. I was worried that there would be ice on my feet as well. But the temperature was only below freezing so we made it up the frozen valley and climbed over the ice cliffs to the next cairn. I couldn’t have been colder. We continued the climb to the top. We ascended the first ridge and we were back on the snowy mountainside. We went straight down to the parking lot and then took the road back.","As the craggy hillside in front of me started to appear, I was slightly nervous. As I got closer, the temperature dropped again and, once the haze had cleared, it looked like a winter wonderland. Suddenly it was snowing and I got shivering again. When I was on top, I found myself gazing out at the summit with the summit in sight. With my eyes still sealed I took photos as the clouds slowly drifted away.","As temperatures dropped steadily, I reached the summit of Ben Nevis with a group of friends. We had all climbed Ben Nevis before, but this was my first big climb, so we started at about 10am. It was cold, but the sun was out and we could see the snow capped peaks from our car. It was a wonderful morning. On the way to the summit, we stopped at the top of Ben Nevis, where we had an apsidal cleft to acclimatise and rest our legs. We started our ascent just at 7am, and by 10am we had reached the cleft. I started my ascent at 6am and reached the summit at 9am. It was a beautiful, sunny day, and we ate our packed lunch on the summit. My friends and I had a good climb, but we had a bit of a scramble halfway up the route. The route was difficult, but luckily we had a guide. We reached the summit just after 10am. We were given the summit rope, and started our descent. It had been a beautiful day. We found a sheltered spot in a crevasse to camp, and waited for the next day. That day remained cold and wet, but on the way back to base camp we saw a couple of people who were very tired. They were off climbing the East face, and were going to descend to Loch Nevis. I told them that I was going to climb up to where they were. They said they would meet us and go back down at 10am. We had started to descend when the weather had improved, but I was cold and wet and wished to stay down. Our first route didn't go very well, because we had to follow the snow, and the snow on the rock was a different shade to the rest of the mountain. This meant we had to descend carefully to avoid slipping when going down, and this meant that we lost valuable time. I thought for sure it had to be very cold up there and it was certainly not a pleasant walk. It wasn't really a day I won't ever forget. It was a great day out with some great friends and we could see some amazing things from the summit. We had a great time and I'm looking forward to next year. I highly recommend it to anyone that can find the time.","""The wind can be quite severe when you're going fast, but it's never really bad."" The winter season on Ben Nevis is tough, with snow falling during the night. That meant that our route was difficult and challenging, as we could only climb with crampons. It took us two days to get up the peak, from the start to the summit at 7 o'clock in the morning. It was snowing heavily on the summit, and we landed on the ridge at -3 °C. I'd never climbed mountains like this before, as the weather was too cold to go outside. It was very cold in the first couple of hours as we made our way to the summit. We all kept telling each other ""this must be the hardest climb in the world."" We were all exhausted but a seasoned climber, and we were determined to make it to the top. Keith Hewitt has since completed two ascents of Ben Nevis in the winter, and in 2016 was the first person to go over the summit using the new fixed belay system that the National Park has introduced. We had two options: rappel down the east ridge or scramble to the summit via a new set of steps. I decided to scramble over. It was the worst part of the day; the ropes were wet and I lost my balance as I scrambled across the ice on the top of the ridge. ""I was so cold and had to stop at the top to take my gloves off because my hands were really cold,"" he says.","Our route up the north face of Ben Nevis was to Tower Ridge. It was one of the wettest in the world, it was cold, it had snow, and it felt extremely strenuous. Although it wasn't easy to climb it, I found it much easier that way than in summer, which is why I've done it again and again.","Climbing to the top of Britain Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland and because of its northerly location the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. A lot of people are intimidated by Ben Nevis, but I thought the views were worth it. The climber in this video is Keith Hewitt."
B1,"I was so worried that I would have trouble making friends. However, I found that I really did make a lot of friends and a lot of friends of all ages. One of the many things I have learned about myself is that I really am not that stupid after all.","I am now finishing my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary, although I was earning a reasonable amount of money, I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I think university will give me more opportunities than my previous jobs.","Despite my age being an advantage, being an older student can be stressful. Because I have spent so much time alone, without any friends or support, I have lost the motivation to do well in lectures, and even though I have enjoyed chatting to people in lecture halls, it has been hard to cope with the fact that the professors want me to do well. I have always believed that you can do well in college if you put in lots of effort, be prepared to do the work and make friends quickly. As well as this, I think the biggest reason for my dwindling confidence is that university has been so long since I had any classes. It would be good if I could remember what I had learnt, but I have also learnt to take on new responsibilities, and find new ways to tackle problems.","If you are an older student who has just finished your first year at university, you may feel bored while doing a routine job like being a secretary. However, there are ways to keep your brain active and challenged so that you still get the benefit of all the experience of doing things you enjoy. There is a new kind of book being published all the time called electronic books. Some books have to be read very quickly and written down in a form that may be read by computers. There are more books containing digital information than print books. It may help to think of your own digital device as an intelligent electronic reader. It is a good idea to read books in electronic format. If you use computers they will display the content in the way that you can easily read. For example you can access the content on a computer using an internet browser such as Safari. There are also many different kinds of mobile phones which have digital features such as music, pictures, games and applications. Although it may be difficult to understand all the digital features of these phones, if you don't use your device much, you will quickly get used to it and will not need to use your physical phone very much. It is always a good idea to write your essay and paper in handwriting. It will make it more legible. Many people write the final papers by hand. My instructor gave me a pen and paper to help me write my essay. I made a list of the sources I needed and then wrote the essay. I worked out the best way to include these sources and write the final paper.","My daughter has started school, and she has been with me for three months. She lives on the other side of the country and I don't know if she knows that she will have to leave her home in the next few days. I haven't made any arrangements with her, yet. I told her that I'd like to start college after she finishes school, but she said she might not want to hear about it. I'll have to think about this more when we go over our plan of action.","At 32 I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom.

And the response was great, so we went out again the next day. We met people from all over the world. It was hard to believe, but the majority of the people I was chatting to were women! And so, as we ran, we became friends and we got to know each other a little better. I knew that I was onto something.

At some races, the organisers said to runners: “We’re all male, so we can’t go out on the course, can we?” After I sat in a race for the first time, I asked the race organisers if they could be a little more welcoming to women. And the response was great, so we went out again the next day. And we became friends. I started running again because I knew that this time my injury would not last. I’m now training every week and it’s almost August and I want to finish my half marathon by October. So I’m trying to get out there and start training for my next marathon.","When I injured my back, I had to take a break from my running career.

Grass contains many important chemicals and minerals. Grass is also used to produce fuel and oxygen.,There was once an area called the 'grasslands'. This was the area where people would live with their cattle and sheep. The grasslands were a large part of the land and were mainly covered with a thick layer of green grass.,Grass can be found all over the world. Some are very beautiful and exotic.

B1,The Mozambican government agreed to give her a national contract. Maria now plays football for the Mozambican national team. She's now 24 and has a family and can't imagine a life without football.,"Jose Craveirinha decided that, to help other African athletes, he had to go to Mozambique and be tested by the African Olympic Committee. 'I had to travel to Mozambique' said Maria. 'Everyone was very surprised when I arrived. It wasn't easy - a lot of people thought it was going to be very difficult for me to travel from Portugal'. Maria came to Portugal as part of the team. She stayed for nine months and played every day. She didn't realise that, until she reached her sixteenth birthday, she would no longer be a female athlete. She said she found it hard to accept the fact that she had to change her appearance in front of the camera and the television cameras.","Maria Mutola (born 1963) is a Mozambican football player who played for a team as a girl. Her team won a local competition and Jose Craveirinha learned about her. Having been inspired by Maria's courage and the success of her team, Craveirinha was planning to travel to Mozambique in the near future.","Joseph Craveirinha listened to the story and immediately organised to help Maria, a Mozambican girl, go to a tournament in the USA. When Maria was about to play, Jose asked her about her personal life. 'How would you describe your family?' she asked. 'I'm not married and I don't have any children,' Maria answered. 'But I have two little brothers. I think they will like me as a daughter.' Then he asked her how she found it out about being in a competition. 'I didn't play football until I was 13' Maria explained. 'It was very difficult for me to be a girl in the local team. I was too young. It was a very hard time for me.'",One day Jose Craveirinha went to Mozambique. He saw Maria and offered her a scholarship to train there in order to play in the 1986 Summer Olympics. Maria studied hard and won a gold medal.,"This book is about Maria Mutola, a Mozambican football player. Maria joined her all-boys football team and won a local competition. 'We won' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.' The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes learnt about Maria. He told Maria that she could be a world-class footballer. He was inspired to try to get Maria to play for the national team in the next season. 'Then Jose Craveirinha made a special video of Maria playing for the national team.' Maria won the World Cup in 2000.","The next day he sent one of his assistants to play in the African Girls Championships, in Zanzibar. There she met other African athletes like Maria, who told him they had also played as women. In the end, they both won."
B1,"The Albuquerque Balloon festival has become a regular fixture in the calendar of autumn in the western United States. It was first held in 1972 and has become an annual nine-day affair ever since, the first one being held only fifty years ago. The original idea for the festival was to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. This first balloon was a red, white and blue balloon. Since 1972, ballooning has been a popular part of the festival. This year the festival’s theme is “Always Something New”. The balloons are launched over the city in the morning to take part in the spectacular parade, which moves between the city, the zoo, the fairgrounds, the river and other sites. The parade starts at 10:00 a.m. and ends at 3:00 p.m. in the morning when the balloons are put into the awaiting trucks, tractors and other vehicles. This year, the balloons are inflated by water, helium, propane and electricity. People have made balloon bouquets, which they sell in the city’s many shops. The balloons are inflated by balloonists and pilots. Most of the balloons are made by hot air balloons. The hot air balloons are more durable and lighter than the hot air balloons. They can travel hundreds of kilometers. The helium balloons can float for two days in a row. These balloons are much bigger than balloons. They weigh as much as 300 tons, although their total weight can be up to 1,000 tons. The balloons are released from a launching pad, then carried across the desert to a site for launch. The helium balloons then float across the desert towards the launch pad. They land at the landing site at the end of the nine-day period in a waiting area, where they are checked for safety by flight marshals. In 2007, an 83-foot-long hot air balloon from Canada flew into the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, landing on the lawn in front of the Albuquerque City Hall. The balloon is now about four-and-a-half hours away from Albuquerque. This particular balloon was only launched in 2010. The number of balloons at this year’s festival, including the hot air balloons, had grown to 375, which includes balloons from Germany, Australia, China and the United Arab Emirates. Every single balloon that was launched this year contained a child’s design, which was designed in 1995 by the company, New Beginnings.","Albuquerque is a city in the southwestern United States. Every autumn it turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. It was a very memorable occasion for locals and tourists alike. The number of hot air balloons that flew in 1973 was the highest ever. A total of 152 balloons made it into the skies. Today, there are more than 450 balloons and a total of 40,000 spectators. Some of the hot air balloons fly over a distance of a hundred and twenty miles, while others fly for a distance of one mile. Some of the balloons launch in groups and some launch from a single launch site. They are a sight to see, especially on windy days. The Albuquerque Balloon Festival has grown over the years, to over 500 balloons. The balloons vary in size, with many of them measuring up to 40 feet in diameter. Each balloon is individually trimmed and painted by expert designers. They use thousands of gallons of fuel in the making of the balloon. Balloons also have many extras that make them even more special. Some balloons can be launched at dawn when the sun is low. These balloons also include extra lighting, sound effects, and even ice. The balloons can be launched over the course of a full day in the morning or the afternoon. They can also be alight at night in the desert. There are some rules and regulations about what a balloon must do. The balloons can only be launched during clear weather, and only in the evening. The balloons must be launched by a person wearing a special balloon-control suit and a balloon launch gondola. They can only be launched on windy days. Balloons cannot be launched in windy weather because of the extreme heat. The balloons cannot be launched during a storm. They can only be launched at dawn or at dusk.","The Albuquerque Balloon Festival was started in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station, which had been active since 1952. The idea was then that the balloons would be released in the sky every autumn for a nine-day period. Originally, there were two balloons, but it has grown to be a colourful spectacle, attracting more than 17,000 people each year, some of whom travel thousands of kilometres to come to the city, to watch them. Today, more than 200 balloons are launched. The festival is an all-day event involving public displays of balloons, parades, a variety of food, drinks, shopping and entertainment in a wide range of venues around the city.","The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque turns into a mass of bright colours.

He laughed and said, “It was your fault.” She then ran up the stairs with a flourish and yelled, “The poor servant was stealing my skirt. That was why she was so angry with me. She didn’t understand why I had to explain to her why I had taken it. That was my fault! I should have taken it to the tailor!” He cried out and grabbed his coat and ran up the stairs.

B1,"What is winter driving like? There are times when it is dangerous because of the weather and there are other times when it is dangerous because of the drivers. That's why I don't give winter driving as much thought as normal driving. That’s why I have three cars to drive. The first car is my dad’s snowmobile. The second car is my brother's Dodge pickup truck. The third car is a small bus, which I only use occasionally for my work. The last car is my mother’s Honda Civic. These cars aren't very heavy. And, these three cars are very reliable. They have plenty of room and don't make me feel like I'm driving an old truck. However, we have three cars as well.

B1,"If you’ve ever wanted to learn more about the world of art in less time, then you’ll love this gallery-wide Easter quiz for children. If you want to take part in the exhibition Secrets of the City of London, then you’ll need to stop by the Orange Street entrance of the National Gallery over the Easter holidays. Quiz sheets will be available to pick up there, and you can visit the Gallery free of charge with the paper or on a ticket. There’s lots to see and do inside the gallery including works by Matisse, Picasso, Renoir, Dal, Cézanne and more.

To take part, children are simply asked to take a few minutes to look at the paintings and answer a series of questions about them. The first one they’ll be directed to is a painting by Spanish artist Diego Velázquez, which was inspired by the work of his compatriot, Diego Velázquez. On its front wall is a piece of paper with a large, framed picture of a cat, with a handwritten message. As they’re walking past the painting the message continues: “Cat is... ” The last question focuses on whether the cat’s head is part of the painting, and which part of the body it appears to be. The next one takes children to a painting by Belgian painter, Paul Cézanne, where the painting is made up of an abstract painting with a woman and a cat. The painting then asks them to find an object that is linked to the question of the cat, which is why they’ll be directed to a painting by Japanese artist Ryoji Ikeda titled A Snack in the Garden of Eden. A short video about each painting is available on the gallery website and you can find the full gallery calendar at www.nationalgallery.org.uk.",The Victorian Society is holding an Easter egg hunt for young people which runs all day on Wednesday 26 March in the Orange Street gallery.

Luckily, I wasn't going anywhere and I remembered how to find the ingredients later. I didn't have a syringe or pen so I used a pencil. It was a piece of white paper and I wrote all of the ingredients down on it. After I had finished, I cut it and stuck it to my computer. I added some pictures, a short story and a paragraph on the writing process. I had to take a few minutes in the morning to check if I had written everything correctly and try to put everything into the words I wanted. When I realised there were only five words left on my page, I went back to re-read it, putting more sentences together to make the word count even higher. That evening, I made an announcement on my Facebook page: ""We're holding a Fiction Prize this year and will be giving away £1000."" I had my heart set on winning. I wanted to buy a typewriter and a ten-year-old keyboard, but was too afraid to get anything started. I was hoping it might just be a case of taking inspiration from my good friend, Tom, who won the £100 prize last year. So I wrote an open letter urging others to get started: ""The best way to gain confidence is to start a writing project that you're passionate about and that you enjoy. ""I was inspired by Tom's story 'The Great Train Robbery', but I wanted to give it a twist, so I wrote the letter from Tom's point of view, saying, 'As long as I have a good reason for it, I'm sure I can come up with a good idea for it.'"" My neighbours liked my idea for a game called ""My Story"". As I write it, I think about the main character Tom and the rest of the story. I write about Tom's dad's past, his family, and how Tom grew up in a poor neighbourhood. I write about Tom being a quiet and shy boy, his shyness, and how it made him who he was. I also write about the friendship between him and his best friend. I also write about Tom's grandmother. When I wrote the letter, I imagined he had an older sister who was very distant. He remembered seeing her when he was younger. He described what she looked like. He was kind to her and he was a good cook. He was a good boyfriend to his grandmother and made sure she was happy all the time. I admired him for how he was so good at writing, but I had no idea he would be so successful. My story is about Tom being an intelligent, confident young man, and being happy. I don't know why I wrote this, but it was fun to write and I'm very glad I did. I will definitely be trying to improve my writing skills in the future.",Luca walked around the woods looking at the things which caught her eye.

B1,"In 370 A.D., Hypatia was a young girl in Egypt. As a child, she was drawn to the science she saw in the sky and in the stars. She learned to read in her mother's books, a skill not generally possessed by women at that time. She studied geometry and the laws of motion, and she loved to study the stars herself. Hypatia also knew that learning to read would help her study mathematics. Her parents were proud of her and encouraged her to learn more. Then she set up a school of mathematics for young girls in Alexandria. She was able to make friends quickly, and soon she was gaining a reputation as an expert. At a young age, she was elected chairman of the Mathematics committee of the school. She also worked as a librarian, publishing many books about mathematics. Soon she was working hard on her own projects, and in addition to her school work, she was also working on a collection of poems. She became an accomplished poet when she wrote a collection of poetry titled The Seven Mysteries. She wrote her poetry so fast that it made the poet very jealous. Some of her poems were so beautiful that even her enemies had to write their own versions to praise her. Once they were published, it was difficult for other writers to find her because of the strict laws against women writers. She lived a sheltered and happy life with her parents and her school. Hypatia's friends included men who had been scholars of mathematics and geometry, and they encouraged her to study math as well. She had many other scientific friends, including philosophers, and she became very good at math. By 380 A.D., Hypatia had become a very respected mathematician, and she continued to write, even after she married her father. Hypatia wrote two more books, the Book of Numbers, and Book of Numbers of Time, both written around 400 A.D. Her work made her famous, and so she married her second husband. His family was very poor, and he only able to work one full day a week, but he managed to pay his bills. Her writing skills also had helped her get many jobs after she married. Hypatia lived a privileged life, and she didn't need to worry about not getting promoted. She worked hard to be respected as a scientist, and she also worked as a teacher. One day, she started to have doubts. It was then that she read a book written by a Greek astronomer. He wrote, ""What can we learn from stars, planets, and galaxies?"" Hypatia was fascinated. She knew that they were all connected and that our galaxy, the Milky Way, was not just a collection of stars, but an entire galaxy. He questioned her theory, which was that the Milky Way began at the centre of the universe and ended there. She believed that there could be a giant star in the sky called the Milky Way, but that it was a sham. When he asked why he was thinking of this, Hypatia said, ""There is a big star in the sky, called the Milky Way."" She also said that if she could know that the Milky Way was an ethereal galaxy, which is where the light travels, then it must mean that the Milky Way was in a perfect place, and that we could move quickly through it. When she asked what that star looked like, the Greek mathematician, Dionysius, replied, ""I have discovered it in a crystal ball with a model that I can see the stars.""","In 370 A.D., the first woman scientist was born in Alexandria, Egypt. Hypatia had a father who was the director of Alexandria University and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual as most women then had few opportunities to study. One day, when Hypatia was twelve years old, a thief stole the things her father was giving to a nobleman. He was beaten and died in prison. Her father said, ""My daughter, you must study diligently, lest anyone get the better of you."" The thief was a man, so the thief used his sword to break a gate in the city wall and steal the things he wanted. Hypatia then told the thief to take them home as she wanted to study. She also told the thief to leave Egypt. When the thief arrived in Alexandria, he made sure Hypatia was not left alone. He made her sit with him on a stool and gave her a book. The thief took out a book with many pictures of Hypatia and a few of the other scholars. He then told them about the thief who had stolen a valuable book. They knew where the book was hidden and they could not find it. This made them feel good and gave Hypatia more confidence. They decided to travel to Alexandria. They also discovered another important piece of information about the thief that was not available to the others. They then found a piece of paper that they could write on. They told the thief to wait in a nearby room. After waiting a while, they could read the page. They said, ""The book that thief is holding has something very important to tell us."" They were right, the thief was right. The page was filled with books. Hypatia knew that she had found a book that contained all the knowledge she needed to become a scientist. But she also knew that the thief had stolen her book. So she decided to help the thief. The thief did this by burning a lot of paper and then drawing on them to write down all the information she collected. Hypatia gave all this information to her father and told him to let his daughter come and study. She started studying at Alexandria University in 370 A.D. She spent her time studying Greek texts and writing down what she learned. She was also studying the Greek language which was not widely spoken at the time. She stayed at Alexandria University for two years after her studies ended and she even wrote a book called ""Origin and Meaning of the Greek Language.""",Hypatia was born in Alexandria in Egypt in 370 A.D.

Here she met and married a Roman named Plato. They had six children together, and her oldest child, Dionysius, became a Christian. In 355 A.D., Hypatia started studying medicine. She knew she wanted to become a doctor and so she decided to do just that. To get there she had to pass several tests to become a doctor. In 359 A.D., she got her doctorate. Hypatia decided to stay in Greece for another 30 years. While there, she took up teaching astronomy and arithmetic. She also studied medicine, and she wrote many books about astronomy and mathematics. At the age of 60 she went to Rome to help her father prepare his legacy and made sure all the great men of history had a place in the history books. One day, a thief snuck up to Hypatia's home and stole all her books. Before she had a chance to steal her treasures, he beat her. The thief had a henchman and so he stole all her books. After stealing them all she threw some of them to the floor and ran to her room. Her father was furious that he had stolen some of his valuable books. He also thought that by trying to steal his books, he had damaged his family and left them without support. Some of his books were later found. Hypatia decided to take his theories and apply them to her own work so that she could improve her own knowledge. She wrote many books. When she died in 380 A.D., she wrote the first book that a woman had written on science and mathematics, which she named De Medicis. She also wrote three more books, which can be found in the Library of Alexandria.","A very interesting story, that will be remembered for many years."

She was patient with me and explained every step. She even made sure that I had a costume when I arrived. I got to the theatre in time for a performance, it was very special. When I got home everyone looked really sad as I had to leave the theatre. It was so sad to leave my ballet friends behind. I was proud to have been a part of the Kirov.

B1,Norwich had long been regarded as a city of wealth and industry which was built upon one of the oldest of the medieval castles in Britain. It had been an important trading centre from the 10th century until the Reformation. Many notable individuals are said to have resided in the city. King Henry VIII was the first to live in a Norwich townhouse in 1601 during the restoration of the cathedral. The first mayor of Norwich was the Bishop of Norwich Henry VII. King Henry VIII rebuilt the cathedral and expanded its buildings in 1607. Many of the early buildings of the cathedral date from that period.,"Norwich the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England. A year later, there was a violent riot at a market in the city when some young people started shooting arrows at one another. They fled the area but many of the city’s inhabitants took refuge in the hills nearby. This became known as a riot. When it came to the conclusion that the riot had failed, the town was destroyed by fire, but the damage was very minimal. In the years after the riot, Norwich became a quiet, safe place to live.","The city of Norwich, in the part of Britain known as East Anglia has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years.

B1,"Samuel Pepys was a Englishman who lived in London and gave an important diary during the late seventeenth century. In his diary, Pepys was able to record events from his life. For example, he wrote about how his life was governed by disease and disease treatments. He describes an enemy navy that was sailing up the River Thames. When he writes about a fire, he mentions how the building was destroyed. Pepys was able to write down what his day was like while he was writing.","Samuel Pepys is the author of many popular diaries. His diary covers a period in the English history from 1660 to 1669. He wrote this diary in the hopes of being a good, wise man. It is filled with detail about the life of a wealthy family at the time and also gives insight into English life in the time, including his marriage, work, and family life. This diary shows that life is pretty complicated in the time of Samuel Pepys. His family, friends, and foes all took advantage of his diary to make it appear to be a perfect record of the life of a family at the time. Pepys also describes the political and social climate in England, from the religious persecution and religion of the time, to political events and the Great Fire of London in 1666. During the Great Fire of London, Pepys recorded how people behaved both at home and at work. One of his observations was that some men were so concerned about losing a job that they never learned to read. He wrote about how some people took the opportunity to retake their lost jobs. Also, some people were hired to do jobs that were not needed and then worked in dangerous jobs with no pay and no protection from the law. Pepys kept a diary, where he wrote about his experiences with people from a wide range of social and social backgrounds. This diary includes stories about the time of the plague in London, news stories about the royal family, and his experiences at court. His most famous diary, The Diary of Samuel Pepys, was published in 1669 and has since been reprinted many times. Today, the diary - a collection of written notes by the British monarch's secretary and secretary-general - is in the British Museum.","Samuel Pepys is arguably the most famous diarist in English. He was born in England and he lived between 1660 and 1669, when he was 23 years old. He started his diary in 1660 and finished it in 1669. He kept it for just over eight years. The diary gives us detailed, interesting descriptions of everyday life in England. Pepys writes about things like disease, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London.","Samuel Pepys, the most famous diary in English, was written between 1660 and 1669. He was living in London when it was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666.","ELEMENTARY LEVEL 1. It was Christmas Day. Mary was working in the mill and her sister, Mrs. Hogan, came to work at the mill, as usual. Mrs. Hogan complained that she hadn’t had a chance to bake her bread yet this morning. They both baked theirs and then took them into the house to eat it. Mary ate all of it and a pound of bread was brought to her, in consequence. She took no time in eating it. Mr. Hogan asked her how it tasted. She told him that she didn’t know what it tasted like and that it should be changed. Mr. Hogan said that the bread had been a bit too stale, but it was still tasty and that she wouldn’t mind buying some more. Mr. Hogan asked Mr. Pepys if he would mind getting some more bread. Mr. Pepys said he could eat it as it is sweet and has a very gentle flavour. He offered to let him eat it, but he refused saying he wouldn’t want to do it again. Mr. Hogan said that if he liked it, he could eat it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Mr. Pepys agreed. Mrs. Hogan agreed. In his diary Samuel Pepys is a very happy man. He has lots of money. He has been married to Mary since May 1660. They have five children. He has an orphaned sister named Anne and a niece named Anne. He has also got a stewardship. In his diary he has problems with money and he spends a lot of money on a draught horse. On Christmas Day, Pepys stayed with Mary but he had a bad time and was ill. Mr. Hogan tried to arrange for Mary to be able to go to St. James’s Hospital, but Mary was ill so he was unable to go. There were a lot of people in the house, Mr. Hogan said to himself. I am not ready to make a deal with the king, so I stayed here with Mary and she had a good time. When she was in the hospital, she stayed at St. James’s with all of his family and so had a lot of fun. Mrs. Hogan told Mr. Pepys she was sorry to hear about Mary and was sorry for not having been able to come to the house. I told him about my illness. Mr. Hogan asked Mrs. Hogan how the poor family was getting on. Mrs. Hogan told Mr. Pepys, that it is very difficult for the poor people to cope with things when they are ill, but the good ones do try and support themselves. Mrs. Hogan also told Mr. Pepys that the Poor People’s Hospital was very poor, he is not sure why. Mr. Pepys had a very cold night so he went to his house and sat on the bed. Mr. Hogan said to himself, he is a poor man and we are all poor, and I am a poor man. I said, “I am not going to sleep tonight so I am sleeping on the floor of the house.” Mr. Hogan said, “you don’t know I’m tired.” Mrs. Hogan said, “this is your bed.” Mrs. Hogan went in and said to her, “this is the bed I want tonight, you have no choice but to sleep with it”. She went back to bed. Mr. Hogan said to Mrs. Hogan, “It is your bed.” Mrs. Hogan said, “I have no choice but to sleep on the bed, and this is the bed I want tonight. Mr. Hogan said, “I have the bed I want today.” Mr. Pepys said, “I don’t think he has any choice as far as the bed is concerned.” Mrs. Hogan replied, “I will be glad to sleep on this bed, if it means I will not die from disease.” Mr. Pepys said, “If I die, there will be no choice for me either, so I will give it up.”","Samuel Pepys was born on December 1, 1630, in London, the son of a minister. He became a member of the Royal Navy at the age of 15. After being injured during the Battle of the Boyne in 1654, he began to write a diary. The diary tells the daily life of Pepys and his family from 1660 to 1669, and includes descriptions of diseases, naval encounters, and the Great Fire of London. It is important to understand that Pepys wrote about everyday life in England during a time when most people did not have telephones or computer computers. A book called The Life of Samuel Pepys was published in 1702.","SAMUEL PEPYS The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys.

B1,"The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the ‘famous Ghan’ which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known for being late. Mark Ottaway, 59, a keen photographer from Melbourne, Australia, took part in the prestigious Ghan Photo Expedition for the Great Barrier Reef National Park for the Ghan, a five-week journey from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan is a railway that travels across Australia from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south, and the train has been called the ‘famous Ghan’. It takes more than six months to make the journey from Darwin across the vast and lonely Northern Territory. The train leaves at dawn and reaches Darwin at 6:55am local time. The Ghan has just spent a whole day in one area, following a route that follows a salt-brined river through a landscape of vast red sand dunes. The train’s journey takes it through several small towns, many of them on isolated dusty track. These remote areas have no water or electricity, and are often without power. At night the train has a generator that uses solar energy to supply the lights on board. By the time it has left Darwin at 11am, it is 9pm and it is still well past 11pm. Travelling so far, with a single companion, would take more than a month by car. If I were planning on travelling across Australia from Darwin to Adelaide in a car, I probably wouldn’t have taken the Ghan. However, the cost of the journey is incredibly cheap. So much so, that I have already booked my flight to Adelaide with Ryanair. As the train is late, it carries over 600 passengers from Darwin to Adelaide a day. While the journey has been relaxing, there have been some delays. At 6:00pm local time, the train was delayed by 12 minutes after it departed Alice Springs. This was just after the train had left Alice Springs. Since the train left Alice Springs at 6am local time, it had to stay at the Darwin station for nearly 12 hours until it reached Adelaide. It arrived at Adelaide by 4pm local time. But I didn’t need to do anything. I was able to catch the bus to Adelaide. I was already at the train station at 4.20am local time, only to find that there was no car left at the platform. I couldn’t find the bus again until the next day, so I simply wandered around the station in search of a new bus. I found one, a silver one, which I used to call the ‘Delilah’ because of the shape it had. At first I thought it might be another train but the driver seemed to be in a hurry to get us where we were going. After about an hour in the car it emerged that the other coach was about ten minutes late. I began to worry about the weather. I parked the car in the shady spot and began to wonder why we had to get up early if we wanted to get to the other side. Mark walked across the platform and onto the train. “What do you mean?’ I asked. “We are in the Darwin town where we will be staying for a couple of days, so I think we need to get to the other side as well,” he said with a grin. “I don’t know. If I’d tried it, I think we could have ended up in a storm and gone through some heavy snow. What do you think? We need to go to the other side before we can get off the train. Mark pondered his reaction to the announcement. “And I thought, ‘You mean I have to take that bus now and then?’,” he said. “You mean I have to drive through the snow?” I thought to myself. “Well, I’m not leaving the train. I will keep my car on the road and drive through the snow,” he said. I had no idea how far he was going to go. When he reached the top of the hill, he saw the train ahead. At least he saw it.",Mark Ottaway was travelling to Adelaide by train from Darwin in the north of Australia.

He was ecstatic to finally arrive in the Adelaide Station where the Ghan train was waiting. At first he thought it was a joke that the train was late, but on closer examination he noticed that he was able to write some lyrics on his mobile phone in perfect Australian English. Suddenly, something extraordinary happened and he noticed a strange greenish cloud slowly float above his head. He realised that he hadn’t heard the sound before. The sound became more and more intense until it was the sound of a plane taking off and landing.

I put on my hoodie, a pair of light-weight shoes with heels and a hat and headed for the train station. The ticket office at Darwin was quite long. I asked a receptionist at the railway station if I could get a day ticket for €17. I had to pay a deposit of €25. The ticket office staff told me that I could get this ticket on the train. I thought that it was a joke but when I got to the train station, it turned out to be a deal, so I booked the ticket with them. Before I left the station, I gave the guard my ticket. The conductor asked me if I could buy a meal which I said yes. I then asked for a seat on the last carriage. I decided to stay in the last seat because it is very close to the windows. I asked where the last toilet was and the conductor told me to go to the next station. Once I was settled in my seat, I looked around me and saw a vast expanse of empty seats. After some looking, I asked them if they were aware of this place being used by tourists, and they said that it was not. I decided to ask how many tourists are there. The conductor was polite, but he would not divulge the name of the small cafe, which was just a short walk away. I said that there are probably only eight people in the café at this hour of the day and I said that I would be going to the next station. I then looked over at the map of Australia and saw it was on the west coast. We had been told by the office that the train would be on its way to Adelaide in a few hours, so I got on the first carriage. The train passed me and there was only one other passenger on it. He said that he was travelling with his wife and that there were four other people on the train at the same time, so he had the seat to himself. I wondered why they were all alone on the train but I soon found out why. Mark Ottaway travelled on the Ghan train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south.

In fact, it was the second last train. It was a bit late for him though since he was travelling alone. The next train would be a bit earlier than I had expected. However, there were only four other people on the train, and he knew that the last train was arriving a few minutes before he was. It was getting late. After about 20 minutes he started to get hungry and started to look for food. Eventually, I found a restaurant that was open and ordered a meal. I was not hungry at all. I ate a large meal and then went to sleep. Later on, he woke me up. He said that he was sorry that he had woken me up. Luckily, I had arrived a bit late. I got off the train at Adelaide. I got off at a hotel that was not far from the train station, and started walking up the path through the woods to the train station. He went a little further but there wasn’t much there. So I went back to the hotel and ate an iced tea before bed. I woke him up an hour later and we went to a restaurant for breakfast, which was"

B1,"What I thought was a bit of fun had turned out to be pretty terrifying in the extreme. Matt had climbed a few routes and was a master at belaying so, after a bit of thought, I decided to do the same. Then when it was time to go on a route, we both had the courage to go on the first one and start belaying. I was terrified. Surely they were going to be roped in at the top with a squealing harness and belay box! So, I went to grab the rope and get on. The first route was quite a bit harder than I thought but it wasn't bad. The hardest part of the trip was the first belay box. I knew we were going on a rock, so there were a few handholds, a small handrail and a big, solid sandbag. The rock was actually quite a soft piece of rock and it was pretty easy to get the belaying box into position. At first, I tried to reach out and grab it, but it was a good 10cm short of me so I just stood there. Then I realized it wasn't too big, but I had to be careful to grab the small ledge and not get caught on anything, which was quite scary. But I started putting everything in place and it felt great when I was ready to go up. This first section of the first belay box was where we had to make sure we got it right the first time. I managed to pull myself up the next part easily enough, but the belaying box was really narrow and the rope came off the bolt too quickly for me. On the way up I got really tense and worried about falling back down. I got to the top and I thought about how my feet were in a lot of pain so I pulled them off and laid down again. I was shivering and numb in that moment and the experience of being 30 metres above the ground made me feel so alive. The next few sections were all pretty easy too, but once we arrived at the top and saw the view, I thought, ""That was pretty damn awesome."" After a few more tense moments we started walking towards the top and then we started the descent. My nerves started to calm down a little while I was hanging there and then we started to scream. I was actually really excited and was thinking this might be a good time for me to try it out with Matt as I've never done anything like it before. The down side was when I got on the ground I didn't feel like I should be there. I got on my harness and started putting all my effort into getting back down. It felt really weird. I didn't want to fall though. After all, it was only about a 15cm rope and I thought I might fall but not this much. I jumped back on and tried not to freak out. Luckily the guides were great and helped me if I needed to use the anchor. After a few seconds of screams, I found myself in the shade. I took my time and I didn't even feel the fear - the adrenaline rush was really exciting. The next day we did the rappel, but I was too tired and went down. On the way up we spotted a beaver and after climbing the remaining route we headed for our cars and returned to the Activity Centre. I was really glad we did it. This was the first time I had been so close to the ground on my own and I had to get very careful to belay without getting caught, or even fall. It was a great experience. I went for a beer afterwards and the atmosphere was so nice I just wanted to go back again.","This is the first story in a series about a rock-climbing activity I was part of. The activity was called 'Rock-Staying'. It involved moving up a long wall of rock using a harness, while the person below you had to walk over a thin metal bar to hold onto the ropes. Matt and I both enjoyed it, and would do it again. It's a fun activity for kids, and anyone can do it, I think.","The Activity Centre was closed on Friday afternoon after a flood caused extensive damage to the building. After an hour's wait, we were allowed to explore the buildings. Matt had a lot of energy, and I hardly had any of mine. He did, however, look like a bloke a bit bored on the way there. We were all very pleased to see our friend's parents, as we could only imagine they were very proud of him. The Activity Centre was divided up into the following: Levels 1 - 4 Rock Climbing Levels 5 - 8 Outdoor Activities We visited one of the main bouldering areas, which is located on the roof of an old barn. The area was built up in the past when it was used as a stable in the 1800s. At this time, only a small part of the original wall remained. The climb went quite smoothly, and we both thought that the way to the top was clear and easy. For the first part of the climb we were a little nervous about the height of the wall. The first pitch was on a very thin handhold. Once we got to the top of the wall, we felt that our nerves had calmed, and started the second pitch. As we got to the top, we were able to see more of the surrounding area and were soon in a much better position. The route we were on involved a lot of overhanging and ledges. We had to make sure to take small steps to allow ourselves to progress through the more difficult sections. It was fun to take tiny steps up and over the ledges as we were getting used to the move. After completing the second pitch, Matt and I were ready to descend. The first pitch was on the left of the building, and we had to face some very technical routes. We were told that the top pitch would not be too tricky, but at that point we were a bit nervous, so we decided that we would just attempt to get down. We also learned the basics of anchoring and self-belay. We sat down on some ledges and enjoyed some delicious snacks. We had a very exciting day, and I learned that even though rock-climbing can be difficult at times, it is not impossible. In the end, we decided that it was safe and we had an enjoyable afternoon. Matt and I couldn't wait for the next bouldering session.","The two of us arrived early for a climbing session. Matt had never climbed before, while I had climbed only once, in the summer. We were both nervous, and climbed about 200 metres per day. By the time we reached the top, Matt had climbed over 200 metres per day. That sounded too difficult, so I took Matt's place on the first wall. Matt and I stood in the shadow of the big tree that was blocking the view from the other side. Matt was about to get scared, but I was just happy to have a challenge. Before we started our training, we learned how to stay balanced. After our training, Matt put on a climbing harness and helmet. I started using the harness and helmet. I got on the climb in a couple of minutes. At that point, I couldn't believe that I was hanging 30 metres above the ground. I started to think about my life. Was it worth it to have such a great time? That was the first time that I thought that. Now, looking down at the river, I realised why people love rock-climbing. I don't need the thrill of being high. I could have just stayed at the base, and enjoyed myself. Rock-climbing is like a roller-coaster that takes you on an exciting ride. We started our training with a half-hour lesson, and climbed the first half of the wall. We were both nervous. As we were training, Matt had to keep his balance. He had to balance on his own and I had to balance on someone else. When we reached the top, Matt had to hold on with both hands to keep me from falling down. I had a short break, then started on the next wall. My fear was no longer there. The wall seemed very steady, and I found the rest of the route easy to follow. We started by climbing down a large ledge and following a small crack on the other side of the cliff. We kept ascending the large crack and making our way down. The second part of the wall was tricky, but we got the hang of it. Soon we could see the glimmer of the river below us, and the cliff was a short distance away. The cliff was pretty hard, so we were both really nervous about it. Matt's fear was gone now. As soon as we were safely on the second part of the wall, Matt asked me if I would mind if we took some photos. I agreed. We then started to climb the final part of the wall. The first part was a short climb, but the other half was quite difficult. We walked up the route, which was about 30 metres long, and were joined by a gondola. We then got down to the other side. Once we were at the other side, we walked up the glimmering cliff. It was a very scary sight! At the end of the walk, Matt looked down and realised how far down we were. We had no idea that this was the top of our climbing experience! It was exciting to look down at the river. We could almost see the sun on our face. The sun had started to go down as we were walking up, but we didn't want to miss the light. We decided that we would go for a walk instead of climbing up to the top. As we went, Matt kept on laughing about how scary it was. We kept up our pace and went up a further rock-climb until we reached the top, which was 40 metres above the ground. Matt was scared of what it was like to hang so high above the ground. When he reached the top, Matt said that he'd never go back down. He said that he would just have to try again next time. I can't say that I agreed with Matt, as I really enjoyed this experience. But when I reached the bottom, I was able to look down at the river below. It was very peaceful, and I even enjoyed it. I got back down the lower routes and found that it was easier to walk down. We stopped at a cafe for a quick drink, then made our way home.","We arrived at 8pm on a Friday evening and made our way to the Activity Centre. The first thing we did was to change our clothes so that we wouldn't get cold while we waited for our instructors. Before leaving, Matt bought us our climbing equipment. Matt explained that there are different types of equipment for different types of climbing and they each cost around £50. We took a small amount of equipment and went down the small path to the first boulder. Before we went on the route, we walked down a short, muddy trail. It was packed with people. We got on the first boulder and it was easy, except that it was quite big. Before we went on the route, we scouted out the first part of the wall. I remembered the first time I ever climbed a rock. After we were on the rock, we went through a tunnel in order to get to the start of the route. After we reached the top, there was a big obstacle. The way had no handholds so you had to climb using your hands and feet alone. You had to climb up this wall while there is no handholds. On the way down, you had to go through a fenced area. You had to be careful about not falling down the stairs unless you were used to it. I forgot to take my safety harness but I managed to keep it on my shoulder. Then we took the second boulder and started negotiating its walls. Usually, this route is easier for beginners but in my case it was the hardest one. I wasn't even sure if I was going to finish this first climb, and was nervous about all of the moves I had to make. I was worried a lot because I'd climbed the previous route more than once before. I'd also never been in such an environment and I didn't think I had enough experience. I kept on chatting with people. Eventually we started to feel the fear and I had to hold on for dear life. I slowed down to a walk and then we decided to rest for a few minutes so I could calm down before we continued with the next. The route seemed to get harder the further you went and I had to focus on keeping my balance on the very loose rock. I started off slowly but soon started to run as I got more scared. I fell but didn't really hurt myself. When we reached the top, we took one more look at the route and we started to descend. I got more nervous and began to panic a little. I tried to keep calm and tried to relax, but that was futile. When we finally made it down the river we looked back up and down at the base of the climb as we looked down at the river. It was lovely. I'd never felt so calm and peaceful. Definitely something I'd like to try in the future.","My friend Matt and I decided to go rock-climbing on a Saturday afternoon. The weather was cold, but it was great fun. We climbed two different routes: the high wall and the big wall. We even had to climb some trees to get to the top. After a week, I felt really excited. I was really hoping that on my birthday, I'd be able to do something that I really like. Despite how scared I was, I really enjoyed it. My feet felt cold on the rocks, but I thought the cool wind from the river would make it bearable. At the top of the big wall we had to climb up some little ledges that looked over the river. At first it was scary because the ladder on the wall was quite high, but I felt good that we could climb the ledges. When we had to climb the smaller ledges, I was really pleased that I was able to. The weather was cold and it was hard to climb on a chilly day, so I felt really sorry for myself. On the way down, I thought I looked down on my dad as he drove away, but he was having a very hard time getting up. I was glad that I had a friend who would help me. We waited for Matt to get on the ledge and then we sat on the bench and looked down at the river, wondering what made the people who lived there enjoy rock-climbing.","We decided that we would go rock climbing on Saturday morning. I'd heard about it from a few friends, and we also decided to get the tickets early in order to find out all the details about the activities. It was a Saturday and the sun was shining, so I thought we might be able to go without getting wet, so I hurried up to the Activity Centre and bought a jacket so I could climb as I was tired. Matt was still asleep when we arrived, so I just asked the assistant if he'd be able to go with us. He said he could bring the backpack over the next day, and that was just fine. We rushed to get our gear and our harness, and when we finally arrived at the Activity Centre, we found a small group of people setting up camp for the next few days. We climbed in the dark, and we were on the ground when they turned on the lighting. The first climb was a little bit scary; we had to slide across a narrow, muddy river bed into a small hole, which we had to climb across again. As we climbed higher we were able to get a better feel for the path, and our shoes started to feel cold. We thought it was probably going to rain while we were on the rock, so we were glad we got the chance to take it easy on the first climb, but we didn't want to risk getting wet. The second climb was also the best. We just could not get the rock right - we were just not strong enough. We were stuck for a long while, and it seemed impossible to reach the top, so we tried to walk down the narrow path so that we could go back up the rock more safely. Eventually we reached the top. We then headed back down and came back to the car. At the car park we got the rest of the equipment: our harnesses and helmets, and the equipment that we needed to climb. A few hours later we came across a family of monkeys, who we could hear squealing in the distance. We knew they would be on the next rock. We tried to climb alongside them, and it felt much easier to climb down than up. Then we decided it was time to come back to the car, and after getting a nice ride back we left the rock area. Matt started to be scared of the climb and started to feel sick. Eventually, though, he decided to keep going. The last climb was the hardest. It involved a combination of using a harness and a tree branch that was twisted around the rope to hold itself. When I reached the top, I felt a bit dizzy, but after a few minutes he helped me up and I started smiling again. I was still afraid, and felt like I should probably call for an ambulance. Matt told me to relax and we could enjoy it some more, but he was worried it might make me dizzy. In any case, we climbed back down and I had a great time. I think we might do it again."

Many of them are cultivated for medicinal uses. Also in the biosphere are plants that withstand different stresses. These plants include the sedge, which is able to survive in the tropical jungle and survive freezing temperatures. This amazing plant shows how even in a cold climate it can flourish. Some of the other biospheres are inhabited by people who show how they have developed close relationships with plants. These people are able to speak to them and even touch them. One biosphere was set up to celebrate and pay tribute to the soldiers who fought in World War One. The volunteers were dressed as soldiers who had fought in the trenches and used to keep watch over the land. This biosphere was the final biosphere to be built and is filled with plant life from all corners of the world. The workers made sure the plants in the biosphere were taken care of and the animals safe and protected. A large part of the plant life on the site is also given over to the public. People can buy t-shirts with their name on them and contribute to the conservation of the biosphere. Visitors can also be involved in the conservation of the biosphere through volunteering. The Eden Project is one of the world’s largest biospheres, with six huge biospheres. It can hold a lot of people. However, it is extremely hard to find the way to each biosphere. Visitors have to navigate the underground tunnels to get to the biospheres. This is also a bit of a challenge. If you know how to get to each biosphere you will find it easier than you think. There are a number of guides that can help you.","First we take a look at the Eden Project in the south-west of England. At first sight the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone, showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is.","It was my first time visiting The Eden Project and it seems like a real fun experience to be in. I especially liked the Biospheres! I really enjoyed walking around and seeing the many plants in each biosphere. It was good to think I would be going into a space ship and being able to understand everything. I enjoyed seeing the different climate zones at the Eden Project. Some biospheres were really cold; others had great climates. The best part of the Eden Project was definitely the food. I enjoyed how they have vegan and vegetarian food in some areas. The food there was excellent, and the chefs were very attentive to the needs of the customers. The food is very tasty, and there are plenty of vegan alternatives. I would say the food here was quite good value for money, but then again, I don't usually go to a vegan restaurant. I think the biospheres were really fun to visit, especially the tropical biosphere. The aviaries were really cool and I would recommend having an aviary tour. The water feature was really cool, and the water shows how much the plants are loving the water. They have also got a very fun interactive aviary and a really cool play area.","The Eden Project Since it opened the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK’s most popular tourist attractions. At first sight, the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone, showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is.","I was in Devon a few weeks ago on holiday. Despite being cold and windy, it was really sunny. I took my children to the Eden Project because I knew they would love it. Before we left, we went on a tour of the biospheres. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone, showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. In the first biosphere we saw a temperate climate, in the second a tropical climate and in the third a Mediterranean climate. We also went to see a rainforest and in the fourth we could see an African ecosystem. I think the atmosphere in the first and third biospheres is really special. Before we left, we went for a picnic on the beach. This was a very nice day."

Millions of people, both young and old, enjoy the hobby. And every year more and more people start a stamp collection of their own and discover an interest which can last a lifetime. Starting your collection is easy because stamps are everywhere. Stamps are a type of postage that is made in the United States, Canada and Australia. They are usually flat and cost five cents each. They are not worth a lot. But collectors of different ages have different collection methods. The oldest collectors have a collection of more than three thousand stamps, but it may not be big enough for their tastes. If you can’t afford this kind of money, you can buy collections of lesser-known countries or even just one stamp. There are very specific stamps that you will not be able to collect. If you are planning to collect rare stamps, you need a special machine. For example, the USA requires that you have a special machine to collect stamps. However, there are many other types of machines, for example, that will let you collect the most common stamps, like postage stamps. The most famous collection is the Royal Mail stamp collection. Some people collect stamps from all over the world, but the royal mail stamps are the most precious ones. You can see some royal mail stamps in museums. Collectors also collect many common stamps. The most common are those from the United Kingdom and the United States.","I like stamp collecting too.

B1,"I grew up reading The Finnegans by Evelyn Waugh, a beloved British classic. At a young age, my mother had a copy of the book with the illustrations by Jane Austen. She and I would sit on our bed and read it in bed together, or if my parents were lucky I would sneak it out on the train. Every time I read The Finnegans it would ring through my head and I’d say, ‘This is perfect for me, I love these women.’ When I started university I knew I wanted to go into acting but I was a bit hesitant at first. My uncle said he was an actor too and I’d always imagined myself playing Polly. My mum had told me how much she loved the book and that I was just like Polly. I remember how excited I felt when it was announced that I would be playing Polly. We started filming in October and I started filming the second series in December. I remember when we found out we were going to be filming again in May and so the casting call was early that month. It was hard to find the right actress to play Polly as it was a huge part of my first year at university and if the script was right, I would be playing a part that was the best fit. I think that’s why I felt the casting process was so tough. The show is set in a 1950’s pub and Polly is a beautiful waitress in the local pub. She’s very naive and loves the sweets. We found that she was a great fit for the part – she was extremely intelligent and had a big heart. We had a lot of fun filming the scenes. The hardest bit was being Polly and rehearsing in the pub as we were getting her down to size. We had to rehearse for over an hour every day and the audition process was terrifying for me. You’re told about the audition when you’re about four and a half years old but you’re never allowed to take on anyone until you’re eighteen. You’re also told to keep a straight face so that you won’t get laughed at! The rest of us were claustrophobic on set and in the pub. I learned to sit up straight and act nervously so that everyone else could see what I was doing. It wasn’t easy, though. My dad’s in the filming of The Finnegans and he was a great support. I found he’d seen it a few times and liked it when I had to tell him, ‘You’re doing it! You’re doing it!’ So I was really nervous and nervous. We had a whole day to film in the pub in the wee hours, if we had been out in the day. We stayed out late and I made quite a few bad decisions because I’d been in a pub with a lot of drunk people. But you have to make them like it and you have to get them to enjoy themselves and take risks. For me that was a challenge, particularly as I’d been so used to sitting in a dark room alone. I was really nervous and kept thinking ‘what if I screwed up? What if I slipped and fell’. I just hoped it was a small error. But the day of filming I was worried we would shoot in a pub that wasn’t licensed for alcohol and I couldn’t find anything. Finally after all that hard work, the script was signed and we were ready to go! The Finnegans is a wonderful role and I’m so proud to have been a part of it. It’s very interesting to see it reimagined in film, especially because the original book was originally written by Anne Macmillan. The script was also revised during the filming of the TV series. What was the process like for you? The Finnegans is a great role because it’s all about being yourself. People can see your true personality in the character you play. I think you’ve nailed what it’s all about and the part I’ve been given was perfect. I always knew I wanted to be a performer but I never thought I could do it. I always thought I’d be an actor but I never thought I could do it. I just hope people see my work and recognise me when they do. I’m only 19 and a few films after I graduated. Luckily, the first film of The Finnegans was released in","Caroline Benson is a new television star. But she hasn’t always wanted to act. After reading Polly Finnegan, a young girl with a terrible crush, she thought she would make a great actress. But a friend – then at the University of Reading – suggested that if she would just do something she’d never done before, she could become a TV star. And Caroline has just done just that.","This week I sat in my bedroom and watched a new TV series starring Caroline Benson as Polly Finnegan. I’d always loved the book but had never acted at school but I’d loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her. My first TV role, I had no idea when it would be. I was a new student at the University of Bath. I was studying Drama and Performing Arts and my first year at university I didn’t know about TV but I was obsessed with the book. This was my first TV role, a big decision for me and the series, I thought, would be a lot of fun. I hadn’t read any acting books so this was my first real chance to learn. I was unsure of the character of Polly and I didn’t know what I needed to know to play her. But I knew about the show because my grandmother used to say I was just like Polly and I always imagined myself playing her. The main characters were very believable and I knew I could bring them to life. The Finnegans was based on a book by Michael Morpurgo called The Finnegans, by E.B. White and it was made into a BBC TV show about a family’s life in Ireland after the conflict in the island in the mid nineteenth century. My role as Polly was a huge challenge. I had to read a huge amount of information about Polly. I had to know all about her, her parents and the history of the Finnegans. And I also had to memorise a lot of lines. I had to memorise a lot of different accents which I couldn’t control and I had to go to a lot of different auditions before I found one that I thought I could do the part well in. I had to be careful about what character I chose, I wanted to play a real-life character. I was very nervous but I was confident with the material. The director, Sarah Dagenham, had a wonderful sense of humor and was very supportive. After filming a lot of scenes, I realised that when I read the script I had no idea where I was going. When I wrote it, it was very different to what I thought. It was easy for me to go into an interview with the director saying it would be easy for me and I would get to play Polly. I was worried I wouldn’t make a good Polly but it was so different. It was very exciting and I cried a lot and got shivers when I was finished. That night was the first time I had ever laughed so hard at the script. I never expected to be playing Polly Finnegan. I love the book and it was very important for me to be able to make a living in the UK on TV, as I want to live in London one day and the Irish people will recognise me and know that I’m from Dublin. I feel really proud of myself and the work I did. Now I’m working as a professional actor and am loving every minute of it.","Caroline Benson plays Polly Finnegan in BBC1's new drama series The Finnegans.

B1,"My name is Justin Rowlatt and I’m the BBC’s 'Ethical Man’. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car, recycling wine bottles, not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out.","Justin Rowlatt is the BBC's ""Ethical Man"". He is a man who lives an ethical life. He spent a year learning about ethics and living ethically. This article is excerpted from the full text of a series of columns he wrote for the newspaper The Observer called, 'Ethical Man'. The first essay deals with an ethical debate about whether or not the way we live our lives can have any real impact on the planet.","I was in the pub at my parents' home when I was chatting to friends, asking them, “Where can I find stuff to buy ethically?” I told them I wanted to live a bit more ethically and that I would have done it if I could. I asked how I could buy more ethically and they explained they would find me a job showcasing the best ethically-sourced products. It seemed like a great idea, so I went to the BBC - in a bright yellow jacket of course. I climbed in, and was soon in the studio, wearing a simple navy shirt and blue jeans. What was I doing here? I thought. I was living a good life. I liked walking and being outdoors. But I was not looking for a full-on vegetarian lifestyle, nor was I trying to do my bit for the environment. What I was doing was exploring my options for living ethically. As I began to change my lifestyle, I was asked about other ways people were living ethically. I was asked how many people were living ethically in their homes. Many of the answers seemed contradictory to the lifestyle I was living, but I did find that many people were already making their own ethical choices. In fact, many people didn't know about the products themselves. They didn't know that some were sourcing ethical foods using organic farming and reducing food miles. As I found out, I learnt more and more, and the more I learned, the more I knew about the products. I was more eco-conscious, I was more socially conscious, and most importantly I felt it was my duty to change, to do my bit for the environment, in my home, in the community and in the world. I learned so much that I'm now putting this knowledge into action for others. I am in no rush to change anything because my real purpose is to share what I have learned so that others may benefit from living ethically. I am living ethically because I am making a difference to myself and to society as a whole, and because I want to see people around the world, young and old, not just doing what's right and ethical, but doing what's right for them. The results have been quite unexpected. People all around the world have asked me why I chose to go from living a car-filled life to living an ethical life. People from all different cultures, backgrounds and beliefs have all asked why I chose to go from living a car-filled life to living an ethical life, and the answers vary. Some people say they just feel happier, others say they lose weight, and still others say they go car-free. It isn't so easy figuring out how to live an ethical life. You need to take responsibility for your own actions and what actions you take. People need to have confidence in their decisions, because they will know that it was their own actions that lead to the right choice, they have a right to feel a sense of happiness when they make the right choice, and it is important that we are responsible for our own actions. People have to take responsibility for not just the actions that they take, but the actions that they take too. A lot of people don't feel comfortable using the word ethical. We believe that if it is done well, everyone will benefit, everyone will be good, and this world will be a better place for it. There has to be an ethical way to live, and I believe that the BBC are there to help people explore these ideas. The journey has been very rewarding - I have been able to make a real difference and help others do the same. I think this is a great way for people to understand how their lifestyle choices are affecting the environment in an organic way.","A BBC camera crew filmed me during my first year as Britain's 'Ethical Man'. One day I looked back and said I shouldn't have done it, and the next I was trying to get out the front door to the cinema. I was thinking to myself, I've been 'ethical' all my life, and it's hard being a journalist when the camera pans out of the window. But I really wanted to find out what being ethical meant. In the end I decided that if I wanted to change my lifestyle, I'd have to leave the car. After all, it's not as simple as giving up the car or not using plastic bags. But I did it. I decided to try things out. I spent a year not using any plastic bags, using reusable coffee cups instead of the disposable, making my own bread every day, avoiding the supermarket because I hate the waste and using the bus for my shopping. I did it because the BBC wanted a spokesperson to explain some of their ethical policies and to explain how they reflected a wider society - and I think it was an interesting approach. So that's what I am now - Justin Rowlatt - the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. I am now living in a London flat that was never intended for me, I get my own fridge and make my own pizzas, I've made my own cheese, I no longer drive, I don't wear jewellery and I don't have a TV. It's all part of being the 'Ethical Man'. My day started with me getting up before the sun came up. It was a great feeling to be getting ready to go to work and the news was that I had been appointed 'Ethical Man' on BBC1 and I get paid to sit on my sofa all day. My favourite things are going out to the cinema, a nice pint in a pub and a bit of a chat with my mum about how I haven't been watching TV. Luckily I got a lot of things right this year. For example, I've never got into the habit of watching TV during the day. We still have the odd episode of Doctor Who, but we only do one, so that's not bad. It's been a year of experimentation, living an ethical life and changing my lifestyle all at once.","I'm Justin Rowlatt, the BBC's ‘Ethical Man’ and the first person to become the BBC's ethical man in the history of television. I have only been at the station for a few hours but I immediately fell in love with my surroundings. From the moment I stepped off the plane I was immediately drawn into the BBC's story. I love that my everyday decisions – such as getting up at fiveam to work at 5.30am every day and cooking at eightam – can still mean a bit of a jigsaw puzzle. It's hard to explain to anyone else who hasn’t been there what a year living as the BBC's ethical man means. I do want to be clear that it was the BBC that asked me to be the ethical man. That said, it took me a while to warm up to the job. I was nervous but the more I got to know about the job the more I wanted it. I soon discovered the people who work there all have the same values as me. They are all passionate about protecting the environment. They all genuinely want to make a difference to society. When I first came to the station they were all very welcoming and helpful but I soon felt at home. I liked how everything was organised and there was a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. It was clear that everyone had been told what to do. I was offered to write about my experiences, which were to be broadcast on Radio 1 and 2 on Saturday nights. To see what I was doing I started to ask questions. One of the first things I asked my boss, Sarah, was when she told me I had to have a full-time job, so I couldn't just go to work all day - I needed to give back to the community. There was a lot to take in, but I wanted to find out what it was like in real life. I had to learn to live without a car and I needed to cut back on my plastic use. There was no point in me living a frugal life like the other people on the programme. Luckily I stumbled on some really exciting information in my first week as the BBC's ethical man: the charity Plastic Free March was hosting a day of bike rides in London to raise awareness of single-use plastic. I knew I needed to go so I headed along. The day started with a bike ride, then a picnic and a pub lunch with some of the people I met during the day. I stayed in one place all day. I walked around the streets of London on the bike and met some really lovely people. It was incredible! We hung out in the city centre, tried out lots of different bars and restaurants, bought a lot of food - there were just so many amazing people. We walked a lot. We went from place to place, meeting as many of them as we could. I learned that people are not all in this for a quick fix. As the BBC's ethical man, I have to make sure I'm doing something meaningful that's useful and worthwhile for people - not just me. I have to make a difference and make a difference for other people - but that's something I have to focus on myself first. If I don't make a difference I won't get paid. Ultimately I want the BBC to produce ethical programmes that show people how to live ethically. By living ethically, I'm trying to show people that, to really make a difference, you need to start with small changes to your everyday life. If I don't make a difference then I won't get paid.","Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car, recycling wine bottles, not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I want to be clear about one thing right away - it wasn't my idea to become the BBC's ethical man.","Hi - I’m Justin Rowlatt and I’m the BBC’s 'Ethical Man'. So what does living ethically mean? Giving up the car, recycling wine bottles, not using plastic bags? I spent a year trying to find out. I’m always surprised by people’s reactions when I tell them I’m the BBC's ‘Ethical Man’. They want to know if I think the BBC is being irresponsible. After all, it is the British Public Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC's parent company, that produces a lot of news, whereas most of the TV and film industry is British. As a result, the BBC is the biggest broadcaster in the world. What does Justin Rowlatt’s role in the BBC’s coverage of the World Food Programme mean to you? Is there anything you’d like to know about living ethically? Do you think living ethically means giving up the car, recycling wine bottles, not using plastic bags?"

B1,"The town of Iditarod was named after a young Alaskan explorer named William Boyd. The old men lived in a log cabin, which they called a hotel. In 1889 a large gold rush hit the area. In a matter of a few weeks thousands of acclimatized young men, women and children arrived in the Iditarod. They were encouraged by the government to set up a race between their settlement and the booming city of Skagway. One such adventurer was Bill Boyd, who travelled from his home in California all the way to the Arctic Circle to seek gold. He found the gold in one place only. But his gold was worthless. In 1909 the race was discontinued. In 1950 the race was revived by its former leader Bill Boyd and he set off on the journey that would become known as the Iditarod.","The Iditarod was an enormously long run that crossed Alaska. Each team had an ox wagon that drove them around. This wagon had to be specially made for the iditarod. The wagon had to carry about 1,000 pounds of food and water to survive the long journey. A racer called Robert F. Iditarod had to travel this distance to win the race. They travelled across the tundra, and then on land, for about 1,500 miles. The last surviving team crossed the finish line in Iditarod in January 1968. In its early years Iditarod was a family affair. One person, Tom Iditarod, was the son of an Inuit chief and was the winner. They said he would do his best to win the race. Tom had to work hard in his village because his parents and grandparents hoped for a son to replace them. The Iditarod was a huge success. At the beginning of the race there were nearly 1,400 dogs. This number doubled a few years later. By 1950 there were over 600 dogs competing. Then in 1979 the race was expanded to include dogs on sleds. The first race took place in 1979. The dogs were named Tom, Bill, Mike and Jim. In each year only three teams participated, and the dog teams were: Tom, Bill and Mike The dogs had two brothers named Tom Iditarod and Don Iditarod. They also had two sisters named Sarah and Alice. These two sisters had one child each. John Iditarod had two daughters named Jenny and Margaret. The race was started in 1959 and there was a final dog-sled race in 1993.","Iditarod means 'far distant place' in the local language. It is a race of 1200 miles which is essentially the length of the US state of Alaska. The name Iditarod comes from the river that runs through Iditarod. It is run by pack animals who travel over rough, frozen terrain at extreme speeds. Dog teams also compete in the race, but this is limited to dogs and ponies with mules or mules, not dogs. The race starts at a point in Alaska known as Iditarod Village, then it travels over a wide range of terrains before ending in the village of Iditarod itself. The winning dog team is said to have clocked an average of over nine hours each day.","The Iditarod – The Last Great Race On Earth A lot of sled dogs and sled dogsleds were raced over the long distance from the Alaskan town of Iditarod in what is now the most northerly state in the USA. It was a grueling race that ran from June 11 – August 25. It was a hard gruelling race with gruelling conditions and fierce competitors. The men were led by the sled dog team known as the Iditarod Dog Team. It was an extreme event. The men would have to race across snow and ice. They would push their sleds through dangerous weather and harsh terrain. The sled dogs were led by the dogsled dog team of the Iditarod Dog Team. Their job was to pull their sleds across the most treacherous ice and snow. The dogs would ride at a brisk pace and must maintain balance. In some places, the dogs could not control their sled. They would lose their balance and fall out. They were also likely to be hit by an ice-laden pack of huskies. The Iditarod Dog Team became famous as the most brutally competitive dog team race in the world. These dogs would beat their competitors on the longest endurance challenge in the history of the sport. At the end of the race, they would race back to Iditarod for the championship prize. These dogs were trained to be the toughest and toughest on earth.","A race across Alaska in the late 1880s was one of the greatest human challenges ever seen. The journey was a four-month journey from the Arctic Circle to the southern coast of Alaska. Almost no one completed it. Many did, though, and for more than thirty years it became the most famous sled dog race in the world.","A young girl in Iditarod, a town in what is now the most northern state of the USA, is excited to tell a story about her friend. Last year, she won an American dog sled race in an adventure called the Iditarod. The contest was called The Great Iditarod. The winner was a dog who went a very long way. He ran across the plains, then through snow to a river where the dogs ran in teams. Some of them walked, but others were in sleds and some rode on a horse. Some ran, some rode. The best dog in the race won a gold medal.","This is the story of the Iditarod - the last great race on earth. It started in 1888 in the area now known as Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far distant place'."
B1,"It's hard to believe that the first 'The Body Shop' was opened in 1976 with the only object of earning enough to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is an international company rapidly growing all around the world. In the years since we began, I have learned a lot. In order to make the Body Shop the global beauty superpower it is today, I have had to change a lot. You see, I learned one thing when I was a kid; I didn't care what people thought of me. In order to change, I have had to change myself. Because if you are honest about your imperfections, then you may discover something new about yourself. So why have Ina been named 'Owner-in-Chief' of 'The Body Shop'? I thought this was so cool because I always thought it would be easy to spot and would be fun to write about. Is there a secret to being in the company? It just so happens I am the 'In-Chief'. I have been so involved with the Body Shop since the beginning and I believe it is because of this and the passion that I have for it that I have been so successful in creating the Body Shop as we know it today. 1. People were not interested in what was going to happen next day. 2. Many things that had to be done had to be taken care of by me first. 3. There were many peaks and valleys along the way. 4. Sometimes I would say, 'If we could just make it last year, we could take it to the next level.' 5. When I would be at a low point the body shop would close and we would go shopping in another store. 6. Many times I would be at a high point and everyone would stop by the body shop and buy the same product and walk away. 7. As the Body Shop grew, I was able to create an amazing team of people who would help us grow. 8. I would always have a few days off from work and would go home and get ready to work. 9. To see the Body Shop's success as a whole is pretty amazing. If you just remember the journey, it shows that it is not only a successful business but a great family business too. 10. I learned that life is not about winning or losing. Life is about doing everything you can to achieve your purpose. 11. When we were first beginning to sell body products, we were very worried about the health of the skin. We were very hesitant to sell soap, lotions, gels, perfumes because we were worried it could kill us all. So we stayed in our home where we had only two children and only a little bit of money. We learned by trial and error that if you were honest, honest you could create something that would work. But that was the problem at the time. If you weren't honest, you would fail. 12. My husband would always tell me to keep quiet. I knew it wasn't good to keep secrets in my childhood. 13. I am very glad to be able to sell cosmetics to women and men of all ages, as well as the children of customers and friends. 14. In the years since we began, our goal was to make sure we did all we could to make The Body Shop the greatest thing a woman could own. Now the number of shops is growing rapidly every week and we are growing in numbers. 15. We are constantly learning and improving. Our mission is to give women of all ages something that they can use to look and feel beautiful and not have to spend a fortune. 16. The Body Shop is an example of a company that can make a difference in people's lives.","The first Body Shop was opened in 1976 by Clare McFarlane who was a single mother with two small children. She was a poor housewife and had only one shop. Today ‘The Body Shop’ is an international company rapidly growing all over the world. In the years since we began I have learned a lot. In the 70's Clare had been living alone. She had worked at a bakery as a baker. When she was sick she went to the doctor and told her she could not work for three days because she had a cold. They put her in a cottage and she came up with a brilliant scheme to sell products to people who couldn't afford to buy them. She put her idea to the public and began to sell products, selling them at fair price. The first Body Shop was opened by Clare McFarlane in a village in Devon. Clare was very poor, so people could buy her products. She wanted to be a great baker and cook. She even asked to be the company secretary, so she could cook for others. She worked hard and she was happy. I was so impressed by what she had achieved. When I was eight I sold my shares in the bakery and opened a small business to earn enough money to feed my children. Clare had worked in the bakery since she was 13 and had been paid £9 a week. Then she went to the same school Clare had attended but without her, she was sent to live with her aunt. When she got home she had only a small amount of money. She was happy to earn enough to feed her family. When she was sixteen I sold my shares in the business and we became very rich. Clare became an international businesswoman and became a great businessman. She had learned a lot in the years since she started. She was a very hard working lady and had a lot of ambition. She saw the world and decided to go after it. She travelled the world to visit all the beauty salons and was amazed by the way they were run. She was a very dedicated worker and would go the extra mile to make sure that her customers had the best experience at her salon. It was a very successful period for her, her daughter Clare and her brothers. Today 'The Body Shop' is an international company rapidly growing all over the world. In the years since we began I have learned a lot. For example, I never thought that in three years I would have a business that had grown to be so large. Today the company has over 1,200 stores and over 500 employees. I have learned a lot and in those years I have gained many important life lessons.

B1,"The first time I used my new guitar, I had no idea how difficult it would be to get a sound. I was sure that the guitar strings would catch fire and that it wouldn't be safe to play. But it turned out to be very easy to get sound. It was like being able to drive away a thunderbolt. Ben tried to practice in the living room, which we hadn't thought of before. After a while we managed to find the right spot and after a few months of practice, I started to think that Ben might be right. Then last week, I took Ben to his first music concert. The band is called the Black Angels and it's a great band that played all kinds of music. We got there about 20 minutes early to get to the front of the stage so that Ben could check that all the cables were in place. It was a bit difficult to get the stage set up at first, but in the end it was quick and easy. I had to stand in the middle of the stage, and then get all the cables out of the way. I started to practice. And then I realized that it was not so easy after all. I had to get the right microphones and amplifiers, as I couldn't be the only one who had problems with that. As I got ready to start, I found myself in a frantic scramble to get the right cymbals and amplifiers. I was able to get my microphones and amplifiers out of the boxes but I didn't have the cables, so I used a screwdriver to push the cables out of the box. Then I put them into the appropriate place and plugged them in. As soon as the music started, I could hear the band practicing. I could see a huge gap between the mics, and I knew it was Ben's microphones. I figured the noise would drown them out, but it didn't. After about ten minutes, I heard the lights go out. It turned out that the drums had a microphone in them. I took a look at them and found them very small and tiny. The wires seemed to be very thin. At this point, I tried moving the microphones and amplifiers, but all seemed to be working fine. I called the school and told them what had happened, and luckily I found some of Ben's schoolmates who were able to help. They all looked at me and assured me they hadn't heard anything. When it was my turn to play, I found my mic in the back of the room and started to jam. After I played a couple of songs, I had to take my microphones and amplifiers out of the box. I was just about to change the cables, when I thought about the problem. Then I got the cable out of the box, and took the mic with me. Luckily I found my microphone in the same place I had put the cables out. The next time I practiced, I realized that the mic wasn't really working. Then I realized I didn't have to play the drums. Then I had to find another place to practice. I went down to the living room and turned on the television. I went into the music room and started playing. I couldn't believe that Ben sounded like he did. He started to play the drums and I saw his face light up. Then I went to his room and started playing. Ben was so proud of himself. I was so proud of myself too. I looked back at his little drummer head and remembered that he was very happy with his progress. So, despite all the effort that we put into trying to get Ben to practice, it all worked out. When Ben finished playing all of the songs, he took the cymbals and amplifiers away and put them on a stand that we made out of cardboard. I asked him why he didn't put them in the stands. He told me that his friends in high school were really happy with his new musical accomplishments.","We had a good time playing together as a band, but the only reason Ben wanted to play the drums was because they made so much noise!","Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday.

She is a member of the British Underwater Federation and holds three world records, including a 122.8 metre dive in 2003. ""I've been free diving with my sister for almost 14 years now,"" Streeter told the Sun. ""We've travelled to about 35 countries, including Antarctica, since I started free diving. My sister and I would often stay at the same spot and we would dive the same spot over and over until we'd got to the point where we couldn't keep going any further. ""It was quite a challenge, because we were constantly breaking each other's records. ""It took me years to realize there was a risk factor, because you can't stop and look down if you don't have to.

B1,A man opened the door of the zoo and came in. He looked at the animals and thought how strange it would be if they were there. He asked the man to let him have a look at the animals. The man turned to the animals and looked at the people but the man looked blank.,"ZOOS A man who was visiting a zoo a couple of years ago saw a monkey in a cage. He didn't know whether the monkey was wild or not. To find out, he got into a cage and started to feed the monkey. The monkey acted obediently and the monkey looked at him. He then showed the monkey to his father, who was also at the zoo. The monkey had been in the cage for three years. The monkey had never eaten before, so the monkey didn't need to be fed. The zoo staff told the monkey that if it did eat it, it would be taken to a hospital because it would make the monkey sick. This monkey would make the best animal of the bunch. The bear looked at the zoo. The bear was very happy to be there and it liked its friends. After a few days in the enclosure, the bear began to leave.","After the earthquake, people started to bring animals into zoos. Before that they kept animals in cages in forest. People kept tigers in cages. Today, many zoos keep the animals in natural habitats. They do not keep animals in cages because of people's desire to see the animals perform. A large zoo even had animals which had never been in a cage in nature.","Zoos have been around since 3000 years ago. The rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos, animals were taught to perform for the visitors.

B1,"For my story I chose a few numbers. I thought about money a lot. It’s a little tricky to explain, though. I had to think about what a dollar looked like, or a centimetre or a kilometre felt like.

The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book a huge bag of sweets or a couple of cinema tickets.,"A number is also called money.

When you go abroad you have to spend money too. The money we have is only like the distance we are able to travel and the costs of our flights. It's very nice to have money because it can buy us things which can't be bought with other things. However, money is only like the numbers we see on paper. Money doesn't really mean anything until you have it. If you have money you can give it away so that your family can spend it on something really nice.",What is money?

It’s easy to understand why the local people are so thrilled to see the rain. The desert is always barren and it was a good thing to see the little green leaves start to emerge.,"Marrakesh has not had any rain for more than three weeks and as a result the city has a shortage of drinking water. But as soon as the rain stops the locals gather around the taps and drink the safe drinking water. In the late evening the city gets extremely hot and dusty and the roads become so dusty the road is difficult to travel on. Some people use their cars and bicycles, others walk. Even the dogs walk on the roads. In the early morning it can still be difficult to get the water in the city. However, when the street gets flooded, locals leave their cars and walk home so they can clean up after the flood.","Marrakesh Morocco is one of the most arid places in the world. It can be rainy any time between November and March, and when it does, the city’s water pipes can’t manage the sudden floods that turn the streets into rivers. But as many winters have remained dry in recent times, when the rain does come it is welcomed by the local people.","There is one major problem with Marrakech’s water supply: it is run off into the Red Sea. If it does start to rain after it has already rained, it can’t handle this volume and soon the streets turn into rivers. So for the people of Marrakech, water is precious. The water is stored in gallons so that it lasts throughout winter. When it does rain, the streets become flooded and people wait patiently to cross them until the water is gone. At that point, people pour onto the bridges to save the city’s sagging roofs. But the rain only lasts for a few minutes. Once it has stopped, it is too late. The roads are again deserted and the people head for the rooftops, where shady cafes and coffee shops have become deserted. Many people are too poor to afford the water, but one family has borrowed a few gallons. They fill a tank and if enough people are interested they will fill one more to take a boat across the river. On one occasion, all the people in the water are tourists and they all start to flood. Before long, the streets are filled with tourists taking boat trips across the river. By the time it’s safe to cross, no one is left to swim in the desert. When the rain stops, the streets are deserted again and the city is again run off into the sea.",With a little rain we can water our gardens and plant trees.

B1,A beautiful girl from an impoverished village appears. She turns to look at Gareth who starts to cry. She has not spoken to Gareth in several hours.

Kath says it's normal that you would have to take part in a circus to become a clown, but this circus competition is a little different. They say it's different because they aren't in the circus. They aren't working the audience and they don't get paid. 'Sometimes, you have to give your life for someone else's happiness' Gareth says. As a result, Gareth isn't allowed to take part. He was asked to go on the competition. He said he would have to lose in order to show that he was a real clown. After that he was asked to stand up in the parade.

B1,"The kids all seemed to enjoy the cooking sessions. However, the only person who never complained of being hungry was Harry. I imagine he would enjoy it even more if his parents let him have a bit more control over what he eats. Harry was happy to eat a bowl of cereal or some fruit, but when the chef turned on his cooker, Harry was unhappy. I've been thinking about you all this morning, wondering what your reaction would be if he'd been asked to help. Aside from the usual grumpiness, Harry did say, ""You were quite surprised. I hadn't wanted you to know that I've been doing it for quite some time now."" I explained that we did this once a week for an entire year and that we wanted to have a go at cooking together. ""I did get a lot of strange looks from everyone. But it's fun and I've enjoyed all of my cooking."" My mum would get a pity party, I guess. ""He had fun though, and I know he'll do it again.""

My mother told me that when I started I was a bit wobbly, but now I'm fine."" He asked, ""Would you like to try it?"" I said, ""You're welcome. I'll get in touch with you if I need more advice.""

Their teacher, Michelle, explains all the food in a calm way. She gets the children to talk to her about the dishes they have made. Michelle tells them they will have two main courses for lunch and a simple desert. The children look forward to this as they have already been told to come up with ideas. Throughout the morning they learn how to work the knives properly, as well as how to use the oven, the hob, the frying pan, the toaster, the electric kettle and the refrigerator. The children are taught how to use their equipment and how to do all the washing up. When the lesson is over, they get to eat their food. Michelle tells the children about some great food they have had such as roast duck, steak and ham. They all loved this course. Michelle also tells the children about the children who have had accidents with the food they have eaten. For example, on the first day of class a child had cut her hand. Michelle told her teacher that the chef had cut the child’s hand too close to the heat of the oven. The next day a child who fell into a saucepan had cut off her hand. The chef had to stop the lesson before he could make a new one for the next lesson. He had a lot of fun doing this. Michelle told the children about all the things they had made on the first day. The children also talked about how the children had enjoyed their first lesson.","After school, the children are required to cook a three course meal. Today, the meals are all different.

One of the ingredients for the curry is prawns soaked in lemon juice and chopped fresh coriander. She also served it with a dollop of yoghurt, a sprinkling of chopped parsley and fried veg. It was delicious. The children were given two plates, one with rice, one with chicken and one with the prawns. Each plate had to be cleaned before it was eaten. Next were the carrots, cabbage, beans, butter, onions and some tomato sauce. Sarah put all the ingredients into her cooker and sat down next to it. She also took out the tin foil she used to cover the plate with. She took out the saucepan and filled it halfway with water. Then she added the garlic and chopped the fresh coriander.

B1,"The collection begins with a series of interviews with women whose lives have been dramatically affected by women's health. The first conversation begins as the writer considers her experiences of women's health. ""Even if you don't write fiction, you can write about this subject in a way that will leave people wanting to know more."" ""How have your experiences shaped the way you write? How do you use your stories to challenge us?"" the writer continues. ""I believe that what's going on in a person's experience is as significant as the fact that it's been taken away or isn't really there.

It's a representation of what has been taken away.""",No Title No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection New Writing 3. Although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain.,"The book I read was New Writing 3. I think it was interesting and varied. I especially liked the first chapter titled 'An Exotic Journey'. I think the author did a good job showing a glimpse into a life beyond the plane. The book then goes on to describe how a character is transported into another world when they lose their identity. There are some amazing examples such as this: 'The first part of 'The Gifted Child', a fictitious book for children. A story by Candia McWilliam set in the near future. An intriguingly detailed, complex and very original perspective on a child in the future. The next chapter was a very long story. The characters of the main character and a number of supporting characters were drawn out and I could picture the story becoming more interesting as more details were revealed. The ending was a bit of a shock. The story was also very powerful because the ending seemed to be the end of the world.","I started reading New Writing 3 the day after I received it. It was very nice, well-written, and interesting to see the witty perspective of a famous author. After a while I decided it might be a good idea to purchase it. I think this would be a good way to encourage young readers to enjoy new writing. I have learned so much in these books and hope to learn more from them in the future.","Many of the works are by famous writers, but there are also some short stories by a range of other writers including John Rees and Paulo Coelho. Although the books are in different languages, they are all worth reading if only for the variety of writers and different experiences they offer.","I had been reading new writing 3 for a while. It is a great collection of writing with the usual variety of styles and genres. Some of the writing I particularly enjoyed are the stories by Candia McWilliam. It is always so refreshing to read original writing, but it is not always easy to find in an older book. You may not even find it in a new book. Some of the writing in this collection may be old, but it is still written well and has a fresh tone. Some of the stories have good characterisations. The book includes fiction pieces by authors such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. I particularly enjoyed the story, ""The Nightingale"". The book is about a bird that dreams it is a fox. It is very strange to see the fox in such a dream. Rose Tremain is writing a novel so I can expect it to be a good read.","An author describes his writing in a simple but effective way. He describes his work as ""poetic and complex"" and says that it contains ""very human behaviour and feelings... all of which are inseparable from the writer's art, his experience, and his perception of the world"". He explains why he chose that particular title for this piece."

""I wish I had a lipstick that looked like that,"" she smiled at Mandie. ""You just never know what can happen on the set of a fashion magazine. It can't have hurt.""","It was a really big shock when I walked into the office. Marie Claire was packed with beautiful girls in white dresses, lace up heels and fancy hair. I felt really nervous because I have never been to such a glamorous place before. Mandie looked so pretty I could have just stayed in my uniform and taken a nap. Marie Claire was very well organised. My first interview was with the editor-in-chief, Natasha, who was very lovely. She was very welcoming and asked me lots of interesting questions. She asked me if I had ever been to the magazine before. I said yes and we decided that the day was the best of our lives. Our first meeting was during lunch, which was amazing because my outfits all looked stunning.","Mandie Currie is a zoo keeper who works as a fashion assistant at The Toronto Zoo. The day before, she attended the press previews at The Toronto Zoo. For her day at Marie Claire, Mandie wore a suit. The still-life photo studio was her first experience of shooting in a professional setting. She had to try out hair and makeup and change into her clothes. She had to go first to a photo studio where she had to shoot a bunch of flowers, then to a press preview where she had to make a model look good. For lunch, Mandie was given some macaroons, a croissant, and a bottle of milk. She was very surprised when she tried to take a photo of the macaroons. She then forgot about it and started licking her lips. Finally she decided to pose for a picture after she slurped her milk.","I have to give the credit to my assistant. She was amazing! I really enjoyed my day at Marie Claire and I got a chance to meet lots of other people I normally don't work with, such as models, photographers and even a florist! I was also lucky because I met the new editor, Mandie. He is so nice and a pleasure to work with. Mandie told me she had just arrived to the office from her job at the zoo. We had a laugh and I got to tell her about the day I had with her. After I got settled I then went to a photo shoot. After that I did press previews, an interview, a shoot for a TV programme and went home to get ready to leave the office. Then I went to a photo shoot in London for the magazine, the photographer was looking for an extra special model to do the cover of the magazine for January."
B2,"The Lagasse brothers have been playing a game called ""Onto a Winner"" for years. It took two years for the Lagasse brothers to make their father’s invention a hit. They tinkered with it in the summer for years, then the lads finally got around to making a product and selling it at the local flea market. The Lagasse brothers got tired of selling the game because they wanted to make a few extra bucks to send to their eldest son, but they knew that if they brought in enough people they could start a big enough business. So they decided to start selling the game on Amazon. They were surprised when Amazon customers loved the game just as much as their dad did. “What an exciting idea,” he said. He looked across at Dave and Norm. “It sounds like the perfect thing for you guys to do."" “So, what is it about?” “Well, it’s pretty much a game to win money. You win money if you have the most money,” Dave replied. “Now, just how much money?...How much money can you really make if you sell an untested product? A lot of people will try to sell you a product that they’ve never tried. You have to go through a lot of hoops to get approved,” he said. “And that costs money.” When Norm saw that he was in for a big hit, he said, “I was just hoping you’d think of a way to make money.” “You’re going to have to sell an untested product, Norm.” “Don’t worry though, it is simple enough for you and me, we’ll put a few rules in the rules so that you can understand it yourself. Generally you try to figure out the easiest way to do something, how to make money, and you need to see things a certain way to make money. That’s why I set out to create something that I could just sell if I wanted to, so that I could make money.” “Yeah, it isn’t that easy, and there’s a lot of money to be made, but it isn’t too difficult. You just need to keep going,” Norm said. He continued, “I am the owner of this company, so I really have to find a way to make money. Initially, I was going to take my product to the flea market in Santa Fe and sell it there, but I would rather take it directly to people and sell it online. My father thought I was crazy, but I’ve found a way to make money and have success.” Dave laughed and said, “But if you’re not in Santa Fe, where you live, the game is probably nowhere to be found.”","The Lagasse brothers look back over the game that made them famous. ""You know, we used to play this when we were children. We played it for hours, and then a friend of ours, who was just learning about our game, told us about this game and made us like it, so it's still popular."" ""We've put the rules in now, but it was quite difficult when we were kids, and we could still get the pieces wrong. They're much easier to move now."" ""But what do we do with the rules?"" Dave asks. ""We sell them as trophies. We put a sticker on it with the rules and a picture of one of the pieces, and put it back into the box. You sell them as trophies. And they're very expensive. We charge twenty cents for each trophy, and the plastic pieces come to about six cents each. It's a very expensive way to buy a piece of history."" Norm tells him about a new game coming out. It's called ""Onto a winner."" Dave catches him, as he says, ""You sold that game on eBay. How many people do you think has played that game?"" Dave asks, surprised. ""About eight. And they've got it on Ebay.""","Both Dave and Norm Lagasse are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico USA and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. Now, the board is being sold by their company, Norm and Dave Lagasse, for $13.95 a piece. The brothers do not know exactly how much money their game is making, but it is certainly a lot. This is a great win for the brothers, who were not expecting to make a fortune from this business. Dave and Norm also reminisce about their own childhood games, the ones they used to play. They remember that some of the smaller round pieces like the squares and the triangles had a special purpose, such as the squares to protect a player from being caught in a move that would result in their opponent being beaten. The biggest advantage of the game is that it can be played by two or more people, even in the most remote areas. So, whether people want to play the game alone or with others, they will find a way to do so. The other brother, Dan, was never an actual player, but he has always seen the game as a way to learn about life, about others, about geography and the universe. He thought that it was very strange that a game that had been played a thousand times by children to this day is being sold as a game, but the brothers think that the competition between their businesses is making it more and more popular. “The game has been getting better, the packaging is better, the prices are better. It’s going on the internet. People are saying it’s better than this,” laughs Dave. Their business is now known as “Dave Lagasse Games” and they sell the game online, for $13.95 a piece. “We have to take our time to figure out how to take our game from a hobby to a profitable business. We’re not making as much as I think we should, but we are having fun,” he adds. “That’s nice, we’re going to have to start charging a little more,” says Norm. The brothers decide that they want to advertise their game in more and more places, so that when they need to sell the board it will be displayed in a more prominent place, preferably somewhere in their home, and it will also be displayed at fairs. “It will look nice on a wall in the living room or in the basement, or in the back room. We’ll make sure the pieces we sell are sturdy and don’t get thrown out. And we’ll give away a few of these. It’s a win-win,” says Dave. Then the game comes into its own: at night, the pieces are stored in a special box, and they will be presented to the winners when they leave. “This should be an interesting game,” says Norm.","The Lagasse brothers are two old friends who still like to play the game called Tic Tac Toe from their childhood days. The Lagasse brothers are two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties who are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico USA and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. The Lagasse brothers grew up playing Tic Tac Toe with their parents from the time they were eight years old. They would play with their friends over and over again, and when their parents divorced they had to stop playing. They used to buy the game from their aunt and uncle or have a friend make a few bucks selling it to their friends. But now they have found their childhood game very good business. “Who is the next big kid to come out with that game?” they ask each other. One of them is David Lagasse, an engineer and computer scientist, who has grown into a handsome 58 year old computer whiz and a successful salesman for a major computer software company. He loves the game so much that he sells it online. He says that he doesn’t like that this game is popular, but he can’t let this one die. “Do you think it would be a good business idea to make Tic Tac Toe a game?” David says. “I think they have done their research on it and we would be proud if it made money. The company needs some marketing help, but we could easily make a big chunk of our money.” The Lagasse brothers have set up a website where they sell their game with all the necessary instructions and pieces, and they are hoping to start a online shop soon.","In addition to their own company, the Lagasse brothers have also set up their own small business, selling their childhood game – they are now selling it at Christmas in New Mexico, USA. Norm explains that the game was originally used by kids in New Mexico during the Depression, when there were no other game-makers. They bought it from a relative who was selling a farm in the village where they grew up. The game was very well received by kids at the time and Norm soon began seeing it as a good business idea. One day he called Norm and asked him to make a large batch of it. He bought 300 rounds of the same size, and Norm set up a small workshop with a few of the pieces. Almost overnight the game went from a toy to a lucrative business. Norm was also able to rework the game to a profitable family hobby. His business was thriving. But it didn’t stop there. Norm also had a large business in real estate where he bought and renovated older houses to be converted into vacation homes. Dave had his own building company where he made a range of wood and plastic products. While their business was expanding, they started reusing the plastic round pieces for toys. They sold their game to a number of different people. Dave is a builder and Norm is a carpenter. The idea of reusing these pieces was not particularly new. They were used to use the round plastic balls for a range of games in the 1950s. The idea of recycling them also seemed pretty new. Now that their business has taken off they are now selling the game on the internet. The business has even spread to Japan where they are selling their product to children. The Lagasse brothers were selling their game at Christmas in Santa Fe and later Norm and Dave started selling them in Japan. The business was profitable and the brothers began a marketing campaign. Dave and Norm went on to buy several companies and set up a website to sell their product in Japan, a process that had taken years. They soon started to see an increase in sales. They started getting emails from people all over the world asking to buy the game from them and they quickly grew to be one of the biggest sellers online.","Norm and Dave Lagasse, both bushy-bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe, New Mexico USA and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. Both brothers are in their forties and they can’t imagine what life would be like without this childhood game. They both sat and played their childhood game many years ago and now Norm and Dave are finding that their childhood game is very good for business. The game they once played when they were kids is still going strong and the brothers say they hope to sell a million of them. They plan to release a DVD and a book which will tell the story of the game. The DVD is being sold by a local comic book company who is putting out a documentary, titled “My Dad’s Game” about how the brothers played their childhood game and the documentary will be filmed and then sold at the local library. “My Dad’s Game” is being filmed as a television program. The brothers are hoping to get the show in more stores and possibly bring it to the movie industry. The brothers are currently trying to get a television deal and are holding a fund-raiser to try to bring in millions. “Onto a winner” is being aired by the national cable network ATV in Canada, and is currently available on DVD.","They were both students of the business department of school but soon they found they had lots of friends who were interested in gambling and gaming. The Lagasse Brothers have a small business selling dice tables. The Lagasses have also been a big part of their local community, as it is their home and their own children used to play there. They have sold over 1300 table-top dice-gaming games to thousands of people and raised tens of thousands of dollars in donations to charities. So if you are interested in gambling or playing games, you might want to consider joining their business."

He knew he was not guilty.,"Dr Kemp opened the window and looked out. He noticed some smoke. He hurried to the door, but there was no smoke there either.","The Dr walked out from under the desk and towards the lighted street. He reached down and pushed open the window and looked out. ""Better than I expected,"" said Mrs. Kemp, who looked at him worriedly, ""do you think that is possible?"" ""Yes,"" said the Doctor, who began ruffling her hair. ""Well a stranger here for sure,"" she said, ""but then he could have been the first one to have got here."" ""I'd have got here before dark too!"" she said. ""But you might have got here if you'd had time."" ""How do you think you know?"" asked Mrs Kemp incredulously. ""I suppose you could've just left town.

B2,"In the French Alps, a few of the most iconic images of human history have been vandalised by tourists. The 36000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps have attracted more than one million visitors a year, but it is feared that such a huge number of tourists could be destroying such an important part of the world's art heritage, the AP reports. The scientists say a new approach is needed to stop the damage, which may never be reversed, and warn visitors to use care. ""Careless tourists are deliberately and intentionally damaging these drawings in order to make them more attractive,"" they wrote in a study of the damage. The group urged the public to take care in their behaviour and to beware if they plan to visit the site. They said there was ""no need to be overly cautious about who comes here, as there are only a small number of really knowledgeable people.""","“The stones are being taken away by tourists. They are pushing them under stones. They are breaking the edges and breaking the shapes. They are scrubbing them away with their boots, and sometimes they are taking rocks that have been carved with drawings to clean them. “The pictures are being used for souvenirs like mugs, plates and bags, which are taken away. The relics of rock art and the culture of the ancient Alps are disappearing faster than scientists can find new ways to protect them,” said Sylvie de Boitesse of the Institute for the Environment, Culture and Tourism, an archaeology university, in France. “Noone cares about the relics because it is just a beautiful sight.” She was in Mont Bego, in the French Alps, visiting her father, who is a French archaeologist. “What was once just a view of the mountain is being destroyed. The rocks are being taken away by tourists.” She said she often had to walk around rocks that were already shaped in some way. “We often have to make decisions,” said de Boitesse. She said that tourists were using hand tools to break down the rocks to remove small pebbles or pieces of glass that had been carved into them. Some visitors have worn off the rocks, leaving nothing behind, she said.","A series of tragic accidents in the French Alps has revealed the worst destruction of the 3.5 million-year-old rock carvings in Mont Bego. As a result, scientists at the Gifford Pinchot National Park are fearing that 36000 drawings on rocks on Mont Bego will not survive for future generations, reports the Associated Press.","In the French Alps, where millions of tourists take tours, many of them unaware that so many pictures are being vandalised by reckless tourists. Researchers are concerned that over time, a large number will be irretrievably damaged. A new study has called for a radical overhaul of the way Mont Bego is protected in order to protect the drawings of prehistoric and historical figures carved into the mountains more than 3,000 years ago.","A group of archaeologists and scientists say they have discovered a unique piece of human art on Mont Bego in the French Alps, where a single tourist can cause significant damage. The 3,000-year-old inscriptions were made by the people of the Isère Valley. They date from the Neolithic era, which is believed to have occurred between the mid- to late 4th century BC. The work on Mont Bego is famous and attracts thousands of visitors a year, most of whom walk to and from the site. But the inscriptions are being destroyed by visitors who think the drawings are nonsense. 'These are artefacts of human history', said a geologist and archaeologist, who focuses on the local region. He told the Guardian that the engravings were made by people in the Neolithic era. 'It is extremely common to see the carvings of people doing stupid things with their hands and feet. But this is different to human art. We're talking about things that were made with our hands, such as writing. There are so many people doing this that it will lead to ruin,' he added. The researchers hope that the paintings can be repaired before they are completely gone. The inscriptions are of significant interest to archaeologists because they can tell us about how humans lived in the region, such as their language and religious beliefs. The figures on the boulders are a thousand years old. The researchers are currently cleaning up the site and restoring some of the ancient stone works before any further damage is done. The team hopes to return by the end of this year to see if the paintings can be preserved.","Thousands of ancient rock carvings in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being gradually destroyed by tourists who trample on them. Researchers said the drawings, made between 8000 and 12,000 years ago, are being damaged so rapidly that they will not survive for future generations.","Careless tourists have been speedily erasing the 36,000 art carvings into the rock at Mont Bego, a site which is one of Frances most important tourist spots. Archaeologists are fearing that the drawings are being destroyed so quickly that they will not survive for future generations. ""It's like a painting that you can see just for a moment. ""The last time he made that rock art, he was about six years old,"" said researcher Dr Anne Prentice of the University of Bath. ""Then he was about 10 and he had a pencil and a ruler. ""Now, in just a few years he's damaged it so much that he won't be able to save it."""

B2,"A few years ago, I was searching for a flat in Dublin. I had contacted the landlord of the previous flat I was staying in and left a message. When I called the landlord’s office, they responded promptly. Apparently a very large family was moving to the area. I assumed the family was in a hurry to move so I left my name, address, and phone number in the message.","It was late afternoon on a warm and sunny afternoon in a quiet area of Dublin. A bus pulled into the station and in a short space of time we were in the local shop. A few minutes later we were in the door. The flat we had been looking for was a large two bedroom house with lots of nice features. There was no off street parking and a small lawn to mow. The garden area had nice gardens and large grassed area for playing football. It was neat and tidy, but we knew it would get full of noise and squander before long. As I walked out the front door it struck me. This flat had all the features I wanted. It was spacious and light. The kitchen was modern with lots of cupboard space. The lounge had a beautiful fireplace and a lovely large window. As we entered the bathroom it was very spacious and the shower suited our needs. It was clean and the toilet had a good flushing system. The bed was comfortable and we had a nice sunny garden. We were very lucky and were first in line for the flat. As you walk in you are immediately greeted by a big welcoming smile. It is immediately clear this is the place we want to stay. We sit in the lounge and there is a chair and two stools in the corner which is our table. We sit together and chat. It really was lovely to meet you.","I lived in Dublin for 6 years, when I finally decided to move to the city. I had been in this flat for over two years with my partner, but I had started to notice a few things in it. I noticed two things: the first thing was the white walls. Usually a white wall is just plaster - it's the smoothest finish - but not always. The second was the carpet was a strange yellow. Basically, it just looked like a tarp with white-looking tacks stuck on. I liked the carpet, but thought it looked a bit odd with the white walls. It was the only thing that wasn't a huge problem to get tacks stuck in. At first I decided to replace them. It would be cheaper to do it and it also didn't have the same effect as if they'd been glued in. When we moved in, the paint had faded a little, and the carpet was coming apart from the walls. In the end, I decided to replace the carpet - and that was the end of the story. I liked the colour, and it also didn't have the problem that the carpet tarped the wall. I wasn't sure what to do with my old apartment, but I still wasn't ready to let it go yet. I had been there for two years, and I had already bought a home in the suburbs. I could live in a flat anywhere. It didn't matter whether it was a large flat, a studio, a one-bedroom flat or a flat with a roof terrace. It would be a flat. My apartment was a flat - I had no time for anything else, it was a flat. When I finally found an apartment to move into, I was so happy. I hung a coat on the hook, and that was that. I wasn't looking for a long term place, just a short term one. I knew the time would come when I couldn't afford the monthly rent anymore, or was over it. I needed a space. But it was an opportunity I couldn't refuse.","At one time there was a lot of new construction in Dublin. The old building – which was near the site of the present city of Dublin – was a large flat complex with six blocks of flats on the same road, but each was rented out to only one family. This meant that there was always another family looking for their own space. When Mr McLoughlin died suddenly in his sleep, I decided I wanted to move to a new house in the new city. I got in touch with him and told him that I wanted to look for an apartment in South Africa. My friend and neighbour, Frank, lives in South Africa, and he was able to give me a price for an apartment in Johannesburg. The problem was, I was still not sure that my wife would allow me to move into a small studio flat with a bed – but I had to find a way to get around this. After some searching and contacting friends and relatives and comparing properties, my friend got me a two-bed flat on the north side of South Africa. Mr McLoughlin liked the apartment and told me about it. He was not sure if I was the right tenant as we had already lived there. I had to move in on Sunday and there was no one there. The problem was that I couldn’t get a job to help pay the rent. I went back to Dublin and the office job I used to work with went to someone else – a lady who had just moved to South Africa and was unhappy about her new flat. I tried to talk her into helping but she vetoed that idea. As my wife is Irish, I was worried I wouldn’t like it here. But this is South Africa. What else could I do?","Initially I was impressed by the flat. It wasn't like other flats I had seen in Dublin; there wasn't a lot of space and it wasn't very modern. The apartment was pretty much perfect for me as it had two double bedrooms (one with a double bed and one single) and a large living area. Despite the fact that we had to pay a deposit, it was cheaper than most other flats I had seen. The area was safe and I think we could live in it for a long time. I also liked the fact that it was near public transport. I went to the flat in the morning and went shopping. I also did my homework. After I got home, I went to see a friend and we discussed a property. I explained that it was for rent so I needed to pay the deposit. The agent gave me a contract to sign, but I thought I couldn't afford to pay the deposit yet. The landlord agreed so I signed the contract at the end of the month. I took the apartment in the evening and I went to see it. It was nice and clean. It was a two-bedroom flat so I didn't need a kitchen but that was a bonus. In the morning I went to the bathroom and the shower room. I had to pay a deposit because I'd missed the payment for the flat so I had to pay the rest of it. The bathroom was very old and there were quite a few spiders on the walls, as well as a huge hole in one of the walls. I told the landlord that I didn't have time to clean it and he agreed. The next day I got home and finished the cleaning. It took me about an hour to make sure the place was clean enough. I also had to clean the kitchen and make sure I had everything I needed to cook for the people I lived with. I didn't know what to do, but I decided I didn't want to mess around with the cleaning, so I went out to the kitchen. My first task was to clean the tiles and the sink so that they wouldn't be stained. I also had to wipe down the shelves, but I had an idea. I would make a mud pies for our friends so they'd have something to eat. As soon as I was done I did the kitchen. My sister had given up having a kitchen, but she wasn't going to move out without an affordable flat to live in. I had to do a job at a construction site to pay for it, but I was lucky enough to get a scholarship and could do a proper job. My sister had to work full time after the Christmas holidays so she didn't have time to go to a lot of work. I told my sister if she felt like cooking, she could bring one from home. This would be a great excuse for me to get out more. I also had to clean the bathroom so I was able to urinate properly. This was very stressful as I didn't have a washing machine and I never had access to a washing machine before. I also needed a shower and toilet as I had the least amount of experience. After I had finished all my cleaning, I went to go to the kitchen and put it all together. I put all the items into the washer and put them in. It was also time to get the kettle ready as I needed to clean it myself. I got everything ready to go. I turned on the tap and boiled the water for about 1 minute. The water was coming out white as though it was boiled. I drained the kettle and started washing the dishes. As the water heated the towels started to get colder and colder. It was now the middle of the afternoon and the temperature dropped to around 7 degrees. I decided to go home and try to get some rest. I was hungry and I was thirsty.","Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place that often worked. The landlord had to give the old lady an extra month's rent. So the landlord told the old lady that, if she would like the old lady to continue paying rent she had to tell the landlord that she had been living in the place for so long she would be retiring in a few weeks. She agreed to the terms and moved in.","He took a train to Dublin from London and had a long walk up the hill. When he reached the top he met the guy who had rented the flat the previous week. At first he had been impressed by its size and the fact that he had a spare key. Seeing the flat filled with other guests he asked: ""What do you think it's like in there?"" ""It's much nicer than what I'm used to, but it's still quite small."" The man said, ""Well, it's only two beds but it's the best we've got."" He pointed to the window and said, ""Oh, that looks nice,"" and then he laughed. ""Then I want to see how the windows work. I think they do them like the windows in my old house. I'll need a ladder to get up there."""
B2,"Last week I was sitting in my interview. The interviewer asked if I was nervous. I said yes. I was nervous. So, how do I give the interviewer the confidence I need to take this important step? Well, it’s a simple idea: have the right stuff when you step on stage. Wear the right shoes for the job. Be yourself and smile. It’s not like I’m trying to sell myself to the person on the stage or trying to be someone else. It’s just about putting yourself in your best light. Have a nice outfit for the interview. If you don’t have anything nice to wear, dress professionally. If you do, you may seem too stiff and stiff. You’ll be nervous so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. Be a good listener. If the interviewer is in the room a long time, they’ll probably miss the subtleties of what you’ve been saying. It’s especially important to pay attention to their questions so you give them the information they want. Do you see the similarities between the two jobs? If the interviewer asks you a question about a particular part of the job, use your best answer to answer the question. If you find it difficult to answer the question at all, ask someone else to give you an answer. Ask a question if you’re not sure whether the question is relevant to the job you’re interviewing for. Make sure you leave lots of time to complete your task. Think about how you can demonstrate your skills to the interviewer. In fact, you can ask your interviewer a simple question and let the interviewer do the talking. For example, “I know your interviewer is looking for a manager of sales. You can explain why you’re the right candidate for this position.” For example, “I know that you’ve worked in a large organization and you have experience in building and managing customer relationships.” You can ask for a compliment or ask a question that’s specific to your experience. Don’t feel bad if the interviewer tells you they weren’t able to interview you because they didn’t have any answers for the question you’re asking. Sometimes, you can come up with an answer at the last minute. For example, “I learned about the company through our website, and I’m extremely passionate about the position. The company is looking for a sales manager and I can’t find anyone right now.” While it’s important to focus on the job at hand and your own skills and abilities, it’s equally important to be yourself and talk yourself into getting it. Practice for the interview and make sure you’re confident and ready to take the next step.","First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress our eye contact our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk our volume and tone of voice as well as our actual words. If you are nervous, practice the following techniques: Eye contact Maintain eye contact with a firm hold for 10 seconds Maintain eye contact with other interviewers Keep your body language relaxed and natural Smile Your facial expression should be friendly but not exaggerated Extend your eyes so your gaze is directed at the interviewer Eye contact Use good eye contact when you speak Eye contact helps make eye contact Increase your volume Use good volume to deliver your message Remember to stand up straight for eye contact.

So before you do anything that may affect the interview, make sure that you are ready for any questions they may have. This includes: Dressing for your interview is easy! The last thing you want to do is go in looking like you just came back from a day out, but even a polka dot dress is more than acceptable. Getting yourself dressed in a suit and tie will not only help you get your outfit right but it will also give you the appearance of having arrived on time. If you are nervous, do not try to overthink it. As you are approaching the interview, stand in a firm but relaxed position with your eyes on the person whose job it is to interview you. Try to look straight into their eyes as if you are saying a question to them. Be confident about your answers to all the questions. Also take your time to answer each question thoroughly. Being clear and concise is important, so be sure you have included everything you need to explain. Using body language helps to establish whether you are talking slowly or quickly and whether you are looking at the person talking to you, so move your feet slightly when you speak to show that you are paying attention. When you answer a question, keep your face in the eye of the person you are interviewing, not looking away. Be aware that when you are nervous, people can sometimes see right through you. Avoid squinting and look away when someone is speaking to you, which will give the interviewer the impression that you aren’t paying attention or are afraid of something. People aren’t going to think you are a good candidate if you look like you’ve just spent the last half hour eating.",First impressions are often lasting ones.

When I went for the interview I went to the store to buy some things and went shopping. I was so nervous. I didn’t have time to dress nice. I was worried because when I went to the store the shopkeeper had all black clothes with white collars. I was very nervous because the shopkeeper did not have a tie. He always wore a black coat. I went to the shopkeeper’s office and he told me the shopkeeper was working hard and had a high percentage of repeat customers. I went to the shopkeeper’s office to look at the people who were already working in the store. The people at the store did not have ties. They had white shirts with white collars. When I went to the shopkeeper’s office I saw that the shopkeeper’s office had white collars. I felt very nervous because I didn’t know what kind of clothes I should wear for the job interview. I did my research about the job and the company and went to the stores to buy the right clothes. I didn’t like the clothes in the shopkeeper’s office because I thought they were to casual and uncomfortable. I thought, maybe they were too old, maybe they had bad habits. They said, it would be better if I wear a suit instead. I started to choose the right clothes. It was my first job. I knew that I wasn’t going to get it, but I wanted to show the shopkeeper that I was reliable and honest. I was going to look like a professional. I did my research and had my friends and family review my CV. Whenever I was nervous, I went to the interview.

B2,"People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. A man named Ian Thorpe, who is chairman of the WWCS, says that the decline of the species ""is happening at a rapid rate"". According to his organisation, this is because they are becoming invasive and have become more aggressive when the water temperature rises. Ian is in an area of the Atlantic known as dolphin hotspots and in an area where some fishermen have also set up camps, the number of dolphins there is in fact ""becoming almost unprecedented."" The species of dolphin that has been the most important for the survival of mankind has become extinct. The world's population is thought to have declined from 200,000 to 200,000 during the industrial revolution, according to WWCS. That number now stands at just under 23,000 dolphins. Ian says that there is no evidence that the decline is due to human activity, but rather because they are now being hit by climate change. He says: ""It is a fact that a very small number of dolphins are now on the brink of extinction. This means that our survival for dolphins at least may depend on it. ""In the face of climate change, we are seeing the decline of dolphins not just globally but even within their own territories. In a survey of dolphins in the Arctic the scientists said they were under threat of extinction at an alarming rate. So why is it that dolphins do not seem to like the thought of warming? What happened to them is that as they got larger and larger they became more aggressive. Over time, their scaly flippers became more pronounced as well as their teeth and they became more aggressive. However, the species does not seem to be affected by climate change as yet as they do not have to adapt as quickly to the change in temperature. ""So what is causing this? Well scientists aren’t entirely sure because we don’t know how the climate has changed. In some cases these changes have been made by human activity,"" Ian tells the BBC. In many of these cases, the scientists found that global warming has led to the expansion of feeding grounds for dolphins. Also, in some cases, changes have also been caused by human activity as well. The scientists claim that in the 1960s a whale shark was spotted by a zoologist in the Gulf of Mexico, who questioned him about the presence of dolphins in the sea. At this point, the scientists could not explain the behaviour of the dolphins, but the scientists concluded that they may have used oil. It seems likely that the marine mammals were dragged into the oil well as a result of their proximity to oil platforms. ""If we want a marine mammal that’s going to be there in the future we’ll have to go to sea and find the oil,"" says Ian. In recent years, the researchers found that human activity contaminated the ocean and the fish that eat it. ""It’s a very complex issue involving different kinds of human activities and even the ocean itself,"" says Ian Thorpe, co-author of the new study ""Dolphins - Where are they going?"" and who is behind the WWCS project. He says: ""It is not clear why we are losing the dolphin species. ""We certainly know there’s an issue with oil, but it is very hard to link it to dolphins and whales. The research does not say why dolphins have become extinct. ""They will likely become extinct if the seas are not managed appropriately.... A disproportionate increase in ocean acidification, in particular due to rising sea levels. Dolphins have been struggling to feed for decades but the loss of marine mammal habitat is a big contributor to this problem. ""They are becoming more inbred. The number of dolphins has been declining but the number of individual dolphins hasn’t. Many marine mammal species are going extinct because of their habitat loss. Dolphins are also suffering from a decline in fish stocks. The world's fish stocks are dwindling because more fish is being caught up in the fish nets as well. So it is only a matter of time before all animals are completely dependent on their food source – which is food. Then maybe that will give them the energy to survive.""","People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas, films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. This is a story about dolphins and their struggle to survive in the wild.","Dolphins are a special species and, for many, are considered a symbol of wealth and happiness. And yet it is estimated that only about 5000 dolphins still survive across the oceans in the world, making them at risk of extinction unless we act. Mark Simmonds, chief executive of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, explains the sad state of the marine mammals. Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. They hold a special place in our affections and, for many, are considered a symbol of wealth and happiness. Yet, it is estimated that only about 5000 dolphins still survive across the oceans in the world, making them at risk of extinction unless we act. And it is estimated that only about 5000 dolphins still survive across the oceans in the world, making them at risk of extinction unless we act. ""This has led to a huge decline in the number of dolphins in the ocean, and if this continues we are likely to see a complete extinction of these magnificent animals in the next 30 to 40 years,"" says Simmonds. It is estimated that between 2,000 and 4,000 dolphins still exist, meaning that the total population is likely to be cut in half in just a few years. The global population of wild dolphins is expected to be cut in half in the next 30 to 40 years, which means that we are likely to see a complete extinction of these magnificent creatures in the next 30 to 40 years. Simmonds says, however, that dolphins are more than just symbolic symbols. According to the prestigious conservation charity there are several threats to the survival of dolphins. Most are caused by habitat loss, poaching, fishing, and pollution. Yet, to preserve these amazing animals, the government needs to ensure that the oceans are healthy and that humans do not impede their existence. This week, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society released figures showing that there are less than 10,000 wild dolphins left on the planet, a figure that is now feared to be understated. ""The extinction of dolphins is one of the greatest conservation threats in history,"" says Simmonds. But he argues that we need to address these issues in order to see a complete extinction of dolphins in the next 30 years. ""With a global population of fewer than 4,000 wild dolphins, and no end in sight, there are just two options left. One is to completely eliminate the dolphins, and start from scratch. The other option is to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus that is causing the decline in the dolphin population. That is certainly the direction in which we need to go, but it is a complex issue and we still haven't come up with an easy solution,"" he says. As the threat to dolphins increases, conservationists will have to go deeper into the ocean to save this threatened species. ""The first step is to identify the causes of the decline. This needs to be done by a careful analysis of the oceans to identify where there are natural threats, where we can intervene, and what kind of action we will need to take to stop the disease. So, if you can, please do something.""",People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas films and TV programmes.

I can do a lot of things at home - a lot of which I can do on my own - and I work four or five days a week.","’This job is good for us because we have our own farm and we have the flexibility to work from home as well as a traditional office. ’My customers are my friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business with a turnover of over £200000 a year and four full-time employees. 'I’ve never been happier. ’It has given me a chance to work from home, do something that I love and have a good time doing.","Sheila SUNSET, a teacher at a rural primary school, runs a small catering business. 'My customers are friends' she says. 'I have a small part-time office in my house, which I work from and a separate office upstairs. So I never feel like I work in a big office. 'My clients are mostly home-based. They are people who I know and I trust, and it makes working for someone else easier. A. LAUREN BOTTOM says she has been working in the country since she was 16. 'I started out with my friend who works in the local church. She saw a gap in the catering market and decided to take the plunge. We went to an open day for caterers and it was the best decision she's ever made. 'I love coming home to my place in the countryside. The people are so lovely there. And the food is so good.' B. NICOLE WARREN owns a business with her husband in their secluded countryside house. She cooks a delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner for clients who come to her. 'They're very loyal,' says NICOLE 'and we do loads of different jobs,' says NICOLE. 'It's been fantastic because we can work when we want and then relax afterwards. NICOLE tells her neighbours she works all the time. 'People ask me all the time what I'm doing. 'So I tell them I make cakes,' says NICOLE. 'And I work the night shifts because my husband is self-employed.","I used to have a dream that I would one day run a business in the countryside. Fortunately, I am now 50, a mother with three young children and a house in the country. I also have the opportunity to work with my husband - I love it!' As for setting up a business, I had no idea that working on the farm with my husband and three children would give me the freedom to do what I like. I didn't even know I was running a business until my husband asked me about it last year, which I enjoyed immensely. I knew it would take time, but I managed it. I've got very good advice for anyone considering setting up a business in the countryside. First, I recommend starting small. Second, don't be afraid to fail. Third, ask for help when necessary."
B2,"-Since Darwin's theory is so revolutionary, a lot of people don't believe it. Yet, evolution still has a huge impact on modern society. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, about 73 percent of all human beings currently believe that evolution can be a good thing. The reason is that, the theory has largely benefited them. According to the IUCN, the reason why people are gaining confidence in Darwin’s theory is that, contrary to popular beliefs, many of the basic elements of his theory are still valid today. The theory of natural selection is widely used and accepted around the world today. Why do you think that is? Charles Darwin wrote that the 'fittest' of animals or plants would be more likely to survive and reproduce. For example, if a lion was born in Africa, then the lion would not only be the most powerful animal but also able to dominate the prey. This led to rapid and enormous population growth.","Charles Darwin (1809-1882) wrote the most important science textbook ever written. In On the Origin of Species published in 1859, Darwin described the process of natural selection. The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. This is how we came to be. 1.

The way we live and breathe has changed. The way we look at the world has changed. The way we think and communicate has changed. What are the effects of natural selection? It’s hard to say. But one thing we know for sure is that things that are ‘fit’ and live well tend to survive and reproduce.,"Charles Darwin was a British naturalist who published an influential book on evolution in 1859. It was called On the Origin of Species. Darwin is best known for his work on the evolution of animals. After studying animals he became so fascinated by them that he wrote several books on them. He first wrote about how fish were created by natural selection, then about how animals could be adapted to survive and reproduce. Darwin continued writing about other subjects including the development of plants and his theory of evolution.","Darwin (1809-1882) was a British biologist, botanist and evolutionary theorist. He is widely regarded as being the first to describe the principles of evolution. He published On the Origin of Species in 1859, but wrote much more about it than that. Darwin did his PhD at the University of Cambridge in 1859, and he was awarded the Darwin Medal in 1861.","Charles Darwin was an English naturalist who published a revolutionary theory of evolution in 1859.

B2,"We set off early and drove through the fields and along the coast, parked on the edge of a wood and the first houses appeared on the far side of the fields. One of them looked a lot like our house but it was not ours. Several days later, we saw several small boats in the water and a boy on the beach with some friends. We all had our phones out and started ringing the bells on the houses in the immediate vicinity. A number of houses appeared next to ours and all four of us became increasingly panicked. The girl looked very upset at seeing our house and I started to worry, especially as it was a holiday that had been planned with this man. I didn't want it to be my holiday. I've known this man for 20 years, so I didn't know this girl very well at the start of our holiday. I asked her when she last saw her mother and she told me that he had gone to Scotland just two weeks before, but we had not agreed to meet up then. She asked where our holiday was going to be and we decided to leave the house and travel to one of the large castles in Scotland. We were planning to hire a car but we were unsure of the cost and it would have to be a week or longer trip depending on the conditions. We decided that if we didn't find a car we would stay on at Glencorn Lodge and try and meet up with her. The problem was that if we did meet up it would be very late. Everyone would have dinner and go off to the pub where they were sure to have a lager with some Guinness and some chips! Everyone could not wait to go back to Glencorn Lodge. It was time for the children to go to bed and the adults could relax. On the last day of our holiday I made a quick run to the supermarket to get some more food for dinner. I went to the supermarket to buy a bottle of whiskey to go with our burger. It seemed that Glencorn Lodge did not stock this drink. The three of us made our way to the shop and found some lager and some Guinness. I noticed that there was a woman selling drinks at the counter. We all thought that this could be her and looked towards the window. I saw a man walking through the door. The man was dressed in a navy suit and he looked young. I asked where the man was but he wouldn't tell me. A small boy with grey hair stood before me and I asked what he was. 'An aos is aos is an aos in Gaelic' he said as he picked the bottle up. He shook his head slightly and looked towards the child. My mother said that she had no idea what he was talking about and didn't have any words to tell me. Her face turned red and she began to cry. I looked up and he looked back at me. I then told her that I was sorry. We drove the two miles back to Glencorn Lodge, parked our car and took the ferry to Belfast. We got off at the docks and took the train to Glenbeagh. I thought it would be nice to go down to the beach for a while. We stopped for a sandwich in the pub before walking across the Causeway to take the train home. The train stopped at the town of Antrim and the four of us took a short walk along the cliffs. We decided to stop in the town of Coleraine on the way back to Glencorn Lodge. It was a beautiful place and I enjoyed the views down to the sea. We ate lunch in the pub and then went to see a play at the castle and took a little boat trip along the coast. Everyone seemed to have a wonderful time but the one thing I have never experienced in life is to see an old castle that has not been lived in for centuries. We all had a nice day and spent the evening watching the sunset from the castle. We then went to the castle and climbed to the top of the hill. We all climbed up on to the roof and looked out over the water for a while before we left. It was a pretty old building and I thought it was going to be a really spooky place to go in. The next morning, we all went on our first boat trip of the day. We went on the boat to the quay and took a walk around the boathouse. Then we made our way down the","A few days later we received the first of our summer clothes. Everyone, except me. I got all excited. The weather was lovely, and it was the perfect time for wearing dresses, and so we had lunch with our old friends at the restaurant in Glencorn Lodge.","This year, however, we decided not to go in June. The reason was that we would soon be getting married. So we didn't want to plan our stay in Glencorn Lodge until we had figured out what kind of weather we would be encountering. The only day we had off in June was when we were arriving at Glencorn. Normally, the beach would be a little crowded, which meant that we had to eat our dinners at lunchtime. That's fine. The weather is beautiful in Ireland. At lunchtime, we could enjoy the view down onto the beach and watch as the sun rose over the horizon. In the evening, we would either sit around the open fire, or play cards with the other guests who were staying at Glencorn.","At first we were delighted by the large swimming pool and sea-view dining room. Afterwards it was difficult to leave the house when the rain had started. The kids enjoyed themselves when they hid in the library or in the games room. One night, I came across a book which was quite exciting. It was an account of a woman called Countess of Carrick-on-Shannon. One day she told a group of children that Countess had robbed the mansion of a diamond ring and was now imprisoned. On the day of the murder, there was a huge storm outside the house. We all went out to sea to try to save the precious gem.","The three of us were in our eighties when we started going to Ireland for a holiday together. We'd been together for forty years. It was June and we were all looking forward to being out in the Irish sunshine again. This time though, things were different. Rather than sit and drink on the porch, the three of us gathered in a circle and discussed the news of the world, with the person next to us sitting in the sun instead. After a short discussion about the state of the world, we decided we'd go on a walk. I had chosen the path of least resistance as it had the least amount of steps and was a bit gentler on the knees. I have always liked hills, but I thought that it might be boring to follow the path from point A to point B, all the way to point C. So I decided to follow the path around the corner to Point B. It took me about a third of the way around, and that gave me time to think about the things that might be on my mind. The last thing I thought about was taking the first step onto the path and my feet falling away as I looked down. I decided not to bother to look down again until I was sure I'd made the right choice. Finally, I made it to Point B and took a look down at the beach and the sea, with my feet still on the ground. The beach was a short walk from the house, and it wasn't too crowded. We found a small beach bar to sit in, but it was quite expensive. After we had spent a few hours sitting around and drinking a few iced teas, I decided to do something different for a change. We had the plan to go out one day to catch some waves, but I had been so busy I didn't get very far. I decided to try the Irish sea lion fishing instead. I fished for about an hour. I had the best catch of the day. There was a small group of dolphins that swam around with me, and they were not afraid of me. When I tried to grab one of them though, the dolphins jumped away. I couldn't wait to get back to my boat to finish the trip. I had brought a few things on my boat including a small bucket to hold water, a small fishing net to throw the small fish back into the sea, and a camera to take photos. When I returned to the boat, I took a quick look around and decided that the sun had set too early, so I had a walk around the beach, a cup of coffee and a few snacks. Afterwards, we decided to have a burger in the cafe we were staying at. I got the burger from a young lady in a red dress. It was good. I did not have anything to eat that day because it was such a long day at the beach. However, we could have eaten more. I decided to take the burger and the fish and eat them afterwards, too. That night I cooked a curry and ate the fish and chips. My parents enjoyed eating the curry and I thought it was delicious. After we had taken our burgers and fish and chips we went for a swim. We walked along the beach which was right next to the beach and did some surfing. It was quite nice. We also went to the cinema one evening. We went to the cinema and watched ""The Hobbit"" the movie set in Belfast. Then we went for dinner at The Bluebird. It was good. We didn't go out or go anywhere for a drink. It was just an afternoon at the cinema, playing some DVDs and chatting. I decided that it would be nice to go for a boat ride too, because it seemed to be more scenic than just walking along the beach. Afterwards, we went to the local pub for a drink and had a chat about our holidays. The bluebird was really beautiful. The next day I took the kids to see it. The bluebird was so beautiful and I was very happy about that. Then we went out to a fancy restaurant and went for some food. We had a nice meal together, and it was time for a drink. We sat in front of the fire and told stories. The next night we took a stroll in Glencorn Lodge. It's a big house with many rooms and a small garden. There were also some sea birds - I think they were seagulls, though I cannot say for sure. We went out to the sea, sat on one of the large beds,","It was summer holiday time and all four of us were heading off on holiday. One day we went up to Glencorn Lodge by the sea and took a dip in the pool. It was warm, but the water was cold.","The temperature was in the 20's when we arrived at Glencorn Lodge. We settled in on a beach chair to soak up the sun. The first day was very warm but we quickly resorted to waterproof clothing when it became rainy. After that, we ventured out to explore the secluded beach, followed by a delicious seafood lunch at Glenarm. After lunch we headed home for a walk round the island."
B2,"A nervous man approaches him, unsure what to say. The man with no ego and no problem is Francois Lombard. There he is, one finger pointing to the floor below, the other holding one foot above the other. Lombard is known throughout the climbing world as one of the world's best climbers. Yet despite being the first to make the podium in a competition, he was only given a 15 second warning after stumbling off the wall in the first round of competition. Today, in his 23rd year, he climbed six routes to finish in the top five in the Women's and Men's World Cups.

Now a challenging climb can be had anywhere indoors or out.,"A few hundred meters away from the wall he is standing on a platform suspended by cables from a thin, steel cable. He holds on to the end of the cable as he lets go of it with a little scream. The floor around him falls away, and at first he appears to be slowed down, but his body moves back to his original position and he regains his feet. After some time he reaches a wall where he leans forward and releases the cables. As soon as he does he reaches the bottom of the wall and he drops down to the floor as he takes a breath. In a few seconds he is back at the top of the wall.","The crowd is stunned by the performance of Francois Lombard, the French climber competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena.

B2,"Sarah Sutherland-Pilch was hired as a chalet girl in the French Alps – and this week she’s back. She’s been working as a chalet girl for three months and has no idea what the future holds. She’s not married but has a dog – a border collie named Lucy – who is her constant companion. Sarah said: “It's not as easy as it looks and in your second year you have to do quite a lot more in terms of planning ahead. “But it's been a really positive experience and I'm very grateful to be part of this great community. “It's definitely a work-life balance. You're always on your feet, you’re constantly getting out and about, meeting lots of different people, there’s not much more that you can do to help your employers – you always have to be ready at a moments notice to help out. You can't really get the break that you'd expect. It isn’t always easy being a chalet girl – the tidiest and most glamorous job in the world isn’t easy, but it does pay well. Sarah’s favourite part about her job is seeing people happy. A lot of her duties revolve around ensuring the chalet is hygienic and tidy. The job involves clearing out the rooms, making beds and scrubbing, so she is a keen cleaner. “This means cleaning the bathroom, kitchen and all the other rooms that are used by guests. They are all so clean and tidy, it makes you want to keep doing it all the time,” she said. As well as cooking, Sarah makes sure that the chalet is kept clean throughout the day, ensuring everything is tidy and the area is as clean as possible. She also checks that dishes are washing up properly, making sure they are clean and laying out plates so guests can see them. “There is a lot of cleaning going on, making sure everything is spotless but you have to be quick, otherwise you run the risk of making someone's room messy,” she said. Sarah’s duties on a ski chalet involve making sure the guests are well hydrated before they get on the skis, making sure everyone is dry and warm before they start skiing, and cleaning up after they have left. After eight hours of skiing, Sarah likes to relax on the terrace where the sun is shining. She enjoys taking guests for walks up the mountain and having a soak in the hot tub, as well as eating a nutritious breakfast. In a typical day, she cooks a hearty breakfast for guests before they head out for their day, and they are then whisked off to a spa where they can go for a massage or a facial to finish their day. Sarah also works in the hotel restaurant and does a little cooking at home. “This is something I have done all my life, so you don’t get much of a break,” she said. She started her work as a chalet girl in 2015, and had been working for a couple of years before that. “My chalet is in a gorgeous house on a mountainside in France, and there are three chalets, so I need to go and find a place that is right for me, so I look after all the chalets,” she said. “It’s a very hard job, but I always try to relax and unwind. There are a lot of people who just love the mountains and doing this part of the job, so if you do well you can take that with you and do it all year round. Sarah was interviewed by Veronica Lee for the BBC's Summerwatch programme on Friday 24 July. You can listen to that here.","The 24-year-old English girl from West Sussex said being a chalet girl is an adventure – but it’s easy to forget about her other responsibilities, such as taking care of the guests, cooking, cleaning and taking them to the slopes for skiing. “It’s just about making sure everybody’s happy and having a good time,” she said. “There’s the usual stuff. Making beds, cleaning the toilets, clearing up after people, all that stuff. But there’s more stuff you have to do. “There’s all the cleaning up too: the plates, the cutlery, the silverware, the silverware, anything to clean and polish. Sarah started working as a chalet girl for a local hotel in West Sussex when she was 18. She fell in love with the sport – she spent her free time playing games like darts, pool and tennis. After a few years, she says she was determined she wanted to work in the hospitality industry. “I would have gone on to study at university if I didn’t want to do chalet work – I had no idea what was involved. “The chalet girl job sounds glamorous, but it’s actually very physically demanding. Most days it’s hard work. Sarah has to wash dishes in the showers, change beds, serve meals, help with food preparations, help out in the lift and drive the minibus. “It’s a lot of fun, and I get to do all of that in the evening, but it’s tiring,” she says. “This is my second year working as a chalet girl – I did the first year for a little mountain resort in Belgium and now I’ve been here for two years. “If I had to choose between a job and a job I’d choose a job,” she says. But she has to say a chalet girl can do both: in between the day job and the work of cooking, making beds and cleaning. “It’s a little bit of everything,” she says. “You have to cook, clean and look after people and look after the resort as well as the skiing. The job is physically tough, but it’s rewarding in a way. After a couple of weeks, she says the skiing gets better. Sarah says the chalet is home to 15 children, who she’s taught how to ski. When they are older, they would like to join a ski team. But when the weather is cold, it’s a lot of fun for her to do something different. ""It’s different, it’s new and it’s exciting."" Veronica Lee is a writer for Newsquest, a regional news website that promotes young writers.","After an hour’s ski-lifting, a hot shower and washing up – this job is never finished. “Chalet girls are incredibly hardworking. They make the beds, make the dinners, clean the bathrooms and deal with other issues. Their hours are long and they’re often exhausted,” Sarah tells Veronica Lee. It’s her second summer as a chalet girl and as Sarah tells Veronica Lee in this week’s edition of ‘A Day in the Life of a Chalet Girl’, it’s clear that being a chalet girl is much different from being a babysitter or a waitress. “You’re working on a huge chalet in the middle of nowhere and you’re in a blizzard. If the weather’s fine, you can watch rugby. If not, you’re in the kitchen. Even then you’re running in and out of the kitchen every day to make breakfast, eat dinner, and pack up. “There’s a lot of stairs,” she says. “There’s a lot of stairs.” Sarah is always busy making beds, making the meals and keeping everyone happy on the hill – whether that’s helping with some of the many chalet-making tasks, taking over from a bloke who has left the building, or getting a glass of wine for a person who is shivering. Sarah’s favourite chore is cooking – but with a little help, she is able to make delicious meals. “I make a huge ham and mushroom risotto and a roast beef and cabbage pie. “I’ll prepare a main course and then I’ll take them to their rooms, serve them and then they can play tennis or they can go skiing. I’m still a chalet girl – and I still cook,” she says. Sarah has never worked as a waitress – and she admits she was a little nervous at the thought. But it was a completely new experience for her. “I never thought I’d like it and I thought I’d eat it up, but now it’s my favourite part of my job because I’m not eating,” she says. Sarah says a chalet girl has a lot of work to do but the benefits include meeting interesting people, getting fit and travelling around the world.","A CHAIRGIRLS’ WORK IS NEVER DONE (Hindi) Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl’s work is never done Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee – in between making beds and delicious dinners. A chalet girl’s work is never done, so after slicing up a big cheese, Sarah tries to get into the kitchen to put it together. She takes up the work in the mountains at a two-star hotel on the French Alps. A 24-year-old from West Sussex, she makes beds and cooks delicious dinners, but there is also much more to do such as cleaning the cabins and keeping the guests entertained. Sarah, who is from West Sussex, has been working as a chalet girl for five years now. She tells Veronica Lee she enjoys waking up at 4am to make beds. One day she was doing laundry and noticed a man washing up and asked her if she was going to do the washing-up for him. When she told him she was not, he laughed. He was trying to make a joke about him. Sarah said it had been her second season working as a chalet girl in France. She is now preparing to head back for another season. She enjoys it so much she would like to become a ski instructor – one day her dream. She says having the chance to be a ski instructor is a huge privilege, something she was very lucky to get after being rejected by an insurance company. “It was such a big step away from home,” she says. She now says the hardest thing is managing to balance her job with her social life. She and her husband, who is also a snowboarder, have two young children, aged three and five. Sarah and her husband live in West Sussex with their three children, Charlotte, 25, Danielle, 17 and George, 12, who are all school leavers. It is also the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah. The first was at a hotel, when she took on a job as a housekeeper on the same chalet, but after getting to know the other staff well, she found that she liked it and wanted to stay, working part-time and travelling with them. She said: “It is very difficult being a chalet girl. You feel as if you are a part of the family, and that is what you strive for. There isn’t a great deal of freedom at work and you are so often under pressure. “I think for me it is very hard to make new friends because I feel isolated. I like doing the cooking and the cleaning, but I think it also gets me in the way because I feel like I have to do it all. Veronica Lee is a freelance journalist. The author of eight novels, including My Grandparents are Cattle Dealers and What Makes a Happy Family, Veronica is the founder of Snowboarders World.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, has been a chalet girl in the French Alps for four seasons. Her job is never done, ensuring the holidaymakers are happy in her hotel. ""I have to be positive, friendly and polite,"" she says. ""I also get on well with the locals, and I'm really happy with that."" It is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, who works at the Hotel Les Arcs ski resort in the French Alps. After working in the hotel’s restaurant, Sutherland-Pilch worked her way up the ladder to become a chalet girl in the resort. She says working at the resort was ""the highlight of my year"" and she is excited about her future. ""It's the perfect job for someone who has a lot of energy,"" she says. ""It's a lot of work, it's never done,"" she says. In her spare time, Sutherland-Pilch likes to spend time with her family, which includes her parents and her two brothers. ""My sister is a professional chef, and she does a lot of cooking for the resort. I'm also very interested in gardening and I've been doing it for the last three years,"" she says. Sutherland-Pilch has worked as a chalet girl in both France and Austria, but the Alps is where she has made the most money. ""As a chalet girl, you have to be really organised in order to get the job done,"" she says. ""We have to plan what we're going to make, what we're going to cook. I want to make the food enticing for people to come. ""We cook a lot of vegetarian dishes, and I'm usually the one who cooks the savoury dishes, the ones which are the star of the show. We also have an Italian chef, and I make some of his Italian dishes, too."" Her other role is making sure guests are looking their best by cleaning, dusting and polishing their chalets and skis. Sutherland-Pilch is particularly organised, and she is well organised – she always gets a lot of work done in her kitchen, so she knows which tasks to focus on. She has organised the dinners for the chalet and the buffet, and she cooks for the other employees as well, including the other chalet managers.","The work of a chalet girl is never done. Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee that her two months working as a chalet girl in the French Alps are tiring but also fulfilling. She can often be found making beds and serving delicious meals, but she also has to be willing to put in extra work, such as cleaning the lodge before guests arrive, and making sure the lifts are always clean. Sarah is in her second year as a chalet girl, and says she is in ""great company"" as many of her fellow chalet girls are on their first years at the resort.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch works as a chalet girl in France, where she spends three months a year to ensure that holiday-makers have a good time.

B2,"AMERICA’S QUICKEST RACER, Hicham El Guerrouj, the world’s fastest 1500-metres runner, has not broken the three-minute-six-second world record for the men’s 1500 metres race since 1998. And since then, nobody has beaten it. Why has nobody broken the world record in the past fifteen years? Why isn’t there a human race record for this distance anymore? The answer, according to Professor Frances Ashcroft at Oxford University, has to do with how far the human body can go during a race. Her research indicates that it can push itself to its limits just four times as fast as it can move in slow motion – and reaches the speed of light at seven times that speed. She says the human body was never designed to operate in an environment as stressful as the racetrack. “There are a lot of elements that are not designed to operate in the same kind of environment as it does for a race,” Ashcroft tells the Telegraph. “There are elements that are designed to operate at lower speed than it is designed to operate at. “And the racetrack is not a suitable environment for those elements of the human body to operate in."" El Guerrouj broke the record in 1998 when he ran a 1500-metre race at the IAAF World Championships in Berlin. “So a lot of this is a little bit like being trapped in a tank. People are constantly working to break the record,” she says. And he's not the only one with a claim that is at the edge of the human physical limits: there has been a push to get to faster times at an Olympic level.","A top world record might seem an impossibility. But, according to a renowned scientist, running isn't just the fastest thing we can do in our lifetime, it's also one of the most dangerous. Frances Ashcroft, a professor at Oxford University, has been trying to discover where a human can go faster than the world record of three minutes twenty-six seconds in the 1500-metres. She and two scientists have analysed two different groups of people who ran the race, one slowed down to a walking pace and the other cranked up their engines, pushing it up to speeds never before observed in men. They then tried to observe the effect of the braking systems on the two people. They measured the heart rate and the breathing rate. Their theory suggests that when you hit the limit of the human heart rate it becomes harder for the heart to pump blood around the body, reducing the force exerted on the heart by 50%. This ""reduced heart rate"" is actually a result of a narrowing of the blood vessels leading to a smaller vein being able to supply blood to other parts of the body more quickly. As well as being faster and healthier, this is also a more powerful heart. The researchers also looked at a range of running speeds and discovered that none of the current world records are in the range the researchers had estimated. The researchers discovered that running at this speed in a straight line doesn't even increase the rate at which the heart beats. In other words, the human body can actually run faster than three minutes twenty-six seconds, even though it uses fewer muscles and is less efficient at pumping blood around. However, the researchers suggest that the speed limit could be in the range of three minutes twenty-eight seconds, which is the length of the longest running foot race in the world, the Tour de France.","The man who smashed the world record for the 1500 metres in 1998, Hicham El Guerrouj, has not beaten his time. His record has stood for nearly fifteen years. That is the longest human record without a single record-breaker since the 1908 Berlin Olympics when American sprinter Robert Mills broke it.","Despite claims by physiologists that the human body is capable of higher speeds than its current three-minute-twenty-six seconds, the record has remained in place for nearly fifteen years. A series of experiments were done at Oxford University. The test subjects ran a series of interval-type races over distances as short as two kilometres. All of them reached sub-three-minute-twenty seconds (which is the fastest that can be run) before losing energy during a recovery period. They were also placed into groups, and each athlete was given different levels of rest, and the time of recovery between intervals. “Our results suggest that, in terms of power output and power input, the human body cannot exceed three-minute-twenty-six seconds,” said Dr Ashcroft, Professor of Physiology and Biomechanics at the University. “It doesn’t stop at three-minute-twenty-six seconds. There is a very important limit to power output; in fact we only reach it after about twelve minutes. If you run for five or six hours in a row, you can never quite reach that point where you stop being a human,” said the professor. During his analysis of records, a new theory was suggested which Dr Ashcroft says could be the next step in human evolution. He calls it the ‘superhuman limit’. The idea was based on the theory of Max Planck, and he and his team wanted to establish if there was a limit to the physical energy that humans can produce after about twenty-five minutes of hard training. The race had to be run over two laps of a 400m circuit. A human being can only go at a maximum speed of around 60 miles per hour, which is a lot of kilometres per hour - the equivalent of running for half an hour. This amount of energy, called the ATP (adenosine triphosphate), is stored in skeletal muscles. This energy is used to convert glucose, a common fuel, into energy. During the race the athletes were also subjected to a number of muscle strains, as well as a constant barrage of stimuli. The exercise and recovery period followed a normal day. During the race, the athlete was required to maintain the calorific intake at the right rate, while the energy output rose significantly during the rest periods. One of the stipulations of the experiment, which took place in the middle of the 1500-meter race, is that if you increase the number of calorific fuels you consume by an average of eight-tenths of a gram per minute, you will burn just less energy. However, the results showed that these changes did not increase the power output to the point where it would have any effect on the performance. But the human body could maintain energy levels at that speed by producing a sufficient amount of mitochondrial energy. Throughout the duration of the race, there was no evidence of mitochondrial loss even under resting conditions. This suggested that the human body could operate at this rate as long as it was not putting all its energy at one time. “As humans age, the amount of energy available increases, which suggests a possible increase in our maximum power output,” added Dr Ashcroft.","The world record was set by the Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj in 1998. Today, nobody has managed to break it. According to the British Association for Human Physiology, El Guerrouj’s performance in the 1500 metres was ‘completely unsustainable over an extended period’, and the British Athletics Federation has been working with Hicham’s team to help him get back to that world record. Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University, who led the team that helped El Guerrouj recover and break the record, explained in a BBC radio interview that some scientists suggest a race like the one which El Guerrouj ran would have caused serious health risks for the competitors. “The human body has always been a slow and steady process of adaptation, and that’s all we have been doing at this stage. During this period, the body is doing a lot of work, changing its size and shape, so it doesn’t get the opportunity to stretch,” she said. The team also ran research in a lab on humans, which shows that for every ten kilograms of body weight, there is a pound that the body can move. At very high speeds, this pound moves slower than most organisms. But at very low speeds the pound does not change, Dr Ashcroft noted. She told BBC radio: “These high speed runners are actually breaking the human body’s rules of adaptation. They are going a thousandth of a second a second faster than anyone else. So there’s only a very short period in which they could go that fast before their blood starts leaking, and their body starts to break down. So they’re just going in a circle, and they’re not going very fast. The pound is moving slow. What’s happening? Dr Ashcroft says there are a few reasons to think that the human body is being pushed to its limits. She says that over time the human body adapts and adapts to running at superhuman speeds. “But we can’t do it at that speed all the time. So at some point your heart rate starts rising very, very rapidly, and then it slows down. The only time it is going up, it’s going down. That’s why El Guerrouj broke his record in 1998. He broke the record in 1998. What he did was to run a 1500-metre race at a high pace, not an easy task with two legs, but he managed to do that. He didn’t run at the same time every year, but he trained hard and he went down a few places. When he broke the world record, his heart rate was at a rate of 155bpm and he was able to sprint as fast as he did. Then, in 1998, the body started storing lactic acid in its muscles. That’s when the heart began to beat faster and faster, he said. “We have no way of telling if the heart was going to get stressed or not because it’s stored lactic acid. But we can certainly check that you are using the lactic acid in your muscles and are using it as a fuel source,” Dr Ashcroft explained. “That gives you an idea. But he was telling you that you’ve reached your peak and it’s not easy to go any faster than that”.",In 1998 the world-class Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj broke the 1500-metres world record with a time of three minutes twenty-six seconds. Nearly fifteen years later nobody has beaten that time. Has the human speed limit been reached? In 1998 the world-class Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj broke the 1500-metres world record with a time of three minutes twenty-six seconds. Nearly fifteen years later nobody has beaten that time. Has the human speed limit been reached?,"An athlete from Morocco broke the 1500-metre world record in 1998 with a time of three minutes twenty-six seconds. Nearly fifteen years later nobody has broken that time. Has the human body reached the human speed limit? Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University is one of the scientists who has tried to answer that question. She says that the human body has two main modes for running. In a high-intensity, short-lived sprint, the body works to pump oxygenated blood through the body, generating energy. This is the aerobic system, and it relates to the physiology of the heart and the lungs, which are both vital organs during sprinting. In the aerobic system the body is the most efficient system in producing energy, and this is how the body moves through the race. A running marathon is a different kettle of fish, in that it requires a different set of muscles, and in this case the heart needs to work harder, and the heart needs to pump more blood. To do this the body has to pump its heart faster, generating more energy. The more work the heart does, the faster it can work and deliver oxygen and nutrients to muscles and other organs, so in the end this leads to faster, less tiring sprinting, and longer lasting energy storage in the muscles. At the same time a sprint needs to take the stress off the legs, and the footwork of the body needs to be good enough to allow the body to use more of that energy. As Dr Ashcroft puts it, a 1500-metre race needs to be run by a body which is more robust and capable of lasting longer distances. That’s why Dr Ashcroft says the 1500-metre is still the fastest ever recorded."

B2,A group of men sat outside enjoying their Sunday.,Matthew is upset and can't understand why Charles is unhappy. 'What do you think about marriage?' he asks Matthew. 'I think you are a clever man - but you don't seem to have any idea what marriage means. It means that you have to be together forever and you both have to be happy together.

Delia Smith, the famous British TV cook and writer, was one of the most popular TV chefs in the world, and was a genuinely good cook. The young man grew up watching her cooking shows. He went to cooking school in the 1950s, and soon found his passion for food. He then went on to study the kitchen arts at Cambridge University, graduating in 1968 with a degree in Applied Social Sciences. He did his first professional job at the age of 22. Then, in 1960, he started his own cooking business in Toronto, where he was known as an executive chef. Before he left Toronto, he stayed at the Marriott Toronto Downtown. In 1980, he opened his own restaurant called Delia's New York. Delia's New York opened in 1985. For almost thirty years, he took many people to his restaurants as a guide, and taught people how to cook dishes. At the turn of the century, he moved to London, where he became a television chef. He also wrote for the BBC, and worked as the food editor of the Sunday Times for over 10 years. Away from the kitchen, he was a well-known figure in Canada. He became the first Canadian chef to become a Knight-Ridder Executive Chef, and helped make the New York Times one of the world's leading culinary magazines. He is still a television cook and columnist for the Times and the Guardian, and the recipes in his books are featured in many Canadian kitchens.","Cooking for all is always a joy, and we're no exception.

Our friend, Delia Smith, is one of those cooks who is famous in her own right. She is a very well-known TV cook, author and presenter. At the age of 52, Delia Smith's last year of television, she came back to show how to cook a very simple soup in a magazine and the result was spectacular. It became a huge success and everyone wanted to learn the basic recipe. For a while we thought we would do a simple soup, but in the end we wanted to make a vegetarian soup. Here is the recipe we used: In a large saucepan, put the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, the carrots, the potatoes, and the garlic. Stir occasionally until they are lightly browned. Stir in the chopped celery, salt and pepper. Allow the vegetables to cook for about 2 minutes. Add the flour to the butter mixture and stir in a little more to break up the flour. Add enough hot water to make a thick sauce. Serve with parsley.","Delia Smith is a British TV cooking and writer whose books have been sold across the world and are regarded as a leading expert on British cookery. Her best-selling book, The Complete Book of Delia Smith, was the UK's top cookery book for five years and her new book, The Complete Book of My Food, has sold over five million copies worldwide.

B2,"Jake felt that something had gone wrong with his old boss. After all, how could he have known that the press conference would not come out as advertised? He was beginning to feel guilty. Jake and Carla had lived together for ten years. He could not recall seeing a newspaper or a television announcement that said that he was being fired, but he knew there had been a change in the Hailey situation since that press conference. Carla looked out the window and saw Carla walking out the door in a hurry. The police seemed to want her to take her own life. He could not let her. He knew it would be too difficult for Carla, who was a good wife, to take her own life. After all, Buckley was on her side. He had wanted Carla to be his confidante. That was why he had always told Carla that he did not want Carla to marry Buckley. Jake and Carla walked upstairs to the bedroom. Carla had called the police, but they had told her that Buckley was not wanted for Hailey murder. Jake felt sorry for Carla, but she knew that he had to get to his senses so that she could be her friend. He took Carla outside to meet Buckley, who was waiting in the shadows. ""Is it too late?"" Carla said, holding a glass of water. Jake walked toward Carla and they were about to kiss when Carla drew close to him and started kissing. Carla was nervous. She knew Buckley was dangerous but she was worried. She was afraid that she might become pregnant. She had to know. She knew Buckley deserved to be hung. Carla watched as Buckley was led out of the prison. When he came out he was holding a gun. She waited nervously while Jake and Carla tried to calm him down. Carla began crying. ""Wait, what?"" Jake said. ""How did you know that?"" Carla asked. Jake said, ""Carla, you were never a good wife."" Carla said, ""You never told me you cheated on me."" Jake lowered his head to his chest and shook his head. Buckley walked out of the jail, but Carla clung to his neck. When he got out of jail, Buckley had already planned on putting Carla in the closet, and he had been planning on murdering Carla before he could get Carla out of the closet. Carla knew the Hailey case was in trouble and that she would not have survived if Buckley had not been found guilty of murder. Buckley was guilty and there was nothing she could do to free Carla. Carla told him that she could do nothing but cry and that she would be just fine. He knew Carla had every reason to cry and that if he could get Buckley out of jail, she could not help but to cry. So they decided to make her cry. Carla told him that it was the only way he could help her.","Jake smiled at Carla and replied, “That was easy!” Carla replied, “It doesn’t matter how hard your eyes were trained. You weren’t the one who did it – but you will be the one who knows how hard the defense must have worked to get the witness to testify against you....But you didn’t do it, so don’t think about that just yet....Then there are those of you who didn’t see, you know you shouldn’t have been watching tonight anyway.” Jake asked Carla if she was aware of how hard she had worked to get the witness to testify against her husband. Carla said, “I can’t say the same. But I am sure she knows there’s going to be a lot of hard work.” Jake told Carla how much Carla had been waiting for a court ruling today.","Jake and Carla laughed when they heard Carla say she had 'the nerve' to call the BBC and said something like that. He thought Carla might have a point since she had already had five hours sleep since the press conference. They waited for the news until after midnight. When they had waited for eight hours, Carla finally told Jake and said she could not think of a possible reason for her being unable to hear him. When they called for a second time, Carla said they had a ring on Carla's telephone and asked what happened. Jake paused and said: ""Well, they aren't here yet and they'll be back as soon as they are."" ""Wrong, I thought you wanted to know about what happened today?"" Carla said as she got into bed. ""I told you that you were lying. You said that you'd find out, that Carla had come down with the flu that night and had to give you a lift."" ""How did you know she'd come down? It was a big mystery. Then, when we got there we didn't have any money, just a ring,"" Jake said to Carla. Carla pointed to the ring. ""What's that? It's a ring that Jake lost."" Jake replied: ""It's the same one Carla had lost on Wednesday night when you were trying to get money, it's the same one you lost on Thursday. This one is not real. And then she slapped me in the back with her bare hands. I don't know how I did it.""","It was late. Carla went to get the cat and Buckley slipped back into the bushes. Jake and Carla stepped in the light. Buckley saw Buckley and knew he should go before the judge. The judge was so impressed with Buckley that he decided to appoint him to sit on the jury. He asked Carla to sit with him. Jake hoped Carla would join him in the courtroom and that Carla would not be ill at all during the trial. ""Why?"" Carla asked. ""Why did Buckley ask for the job if Carla already wanted him to do it?"" Carla answered with a little laughter. Jake smiled and said, ""Joe Buckley just likes to play hard to get. We don't even have to wait until four. We don't need him anyway.""","When Carla and Jake first saw Buckley's photo in the morning newspaper they waited impatiently for the news. When the newspapers arrived at four in the morning and the reporters told Buckley that they were ready for the press conference, they looked at each other and giggled as Buckley's picture was on the front page. At the press conference, the two men hugged and kissed. Buckley grew agitated when he was questioned about the Hailey trial. The judge took his time as Buckley stepped out of the chair and said he had to make his opening statement, and then he was forced to answer some more questions about how he had got arrested. Buckley said he had no idea he had gotten arrested.",Jake and Carla turned on the television as soon as they could. They both knew the news would come when the first local news was over.,"As a consequence, there was no press conference at four o'clock."
B2,"A popular British tabloid newspaper carried pictures on the front page which intruded into the privacy of some people. Even when the pop star had not posed for the paparazzi, it still happened. There was something particularly unsettling about the picture of Lily Tomlin in the pool. She is an assiduous liar who, for years, has been attempting to taint her image. One moment, while standing on the shore in the sun, she spit at the camera. The next, she made a joke about the picture: “Look at the camera” she said. “It is me, and nothing more.” Later, she said: “What you are really saying is the person in the picture has no idea you are there,” she said. For a while, she would write letters apologising for the way she had been treated, and she would read on in the newspaper. She then went into a rant about the pictures. It became clear to her that she was far too much of a liar and that her pictures were not censored before they were published in a tabloid newspaper. She also complained that the photograph had been taken in the wrong place and she had mistakenly been told that the picture was taken in the same place as the pictures of the Princess Diana, Princess Margaret and – worse still – Diana’s former boyfriend. She made a point of sending a letter of apology to the people who had taken the photo. She wrote: “It is so insensitive of you to take a picture of me doing something which could upset or even embarrass me. I’m not a journalist but if I did it my own way, I wouldn’t be taking pictures. “My wife is the only one who can speak up for me. You are not my private person and I shouldn’t have to suffer the pain you have to.” As well as making a personal appeal to the media to take their own pictures of people in their private moments, the letters show that the public have become aware of the damage they have done when they see pictures on the front page. It was shocking to see people who were so resigned to their anonymity on a daily basis get such shocks on the front page. Lily Tomlin was particularly shocked. Seeing her mother’s picture on the front page was a blow to her fragile young daughter who had previously only seen her in public when she was younger. She said that she now felt very guilty about the way her private life had been handled by the media. “I didn’t know I was being talked about by people. It just goes to show how far we’ve come in the past few years,” she said. However, Lily had already learned that she should never talk to any media person about her private life. It was clear that she had been a victim of false allegations and the newspapers had done a lot to make it seem like everything was perfect. A new report by the Public Interest Research Group shows that one in five British adults read tabloid newspapers. It shows that as a result, the public has become more jaded and more likely to ignore or believe false or inaccurate statements in such media articles.",Week after week British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people’s privacy and break the newspaper editors’ code of practice.

A young girl recently came to see her grandmother for the first time in nine years. At first she was sceptical, but then after looking at the photos she began to feel more at ease. She realised that there was a reason for the pictures. It is because she likes to see herself in the public eye and wants people to know her better. It’s a really nice way of getting people talking. For some people it is very hard to see themselves in the public eye, especially in the first place.

B2,"Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is 24 years old, has a degree in music and works part-time as a chalet girl in the Swiss Alps. She told Veronica Lee that the job keeps her fit and healthy. “I like getting up and making beds but sometimes I like making coffee as well. But that’s just a little part of it,” she said. “I make it a point to get up and do the chores if I have the energy. The most important thing to me is keeping the holiday-makers happy.” When she took up the post, Sarah started working in the resort six months before it opened last year. She said she had been “doing it for a couple of years and thought it would be a fun and easy job”. She had been volunteering as a chalet girl at a German ski resort before she realised she wanted to go full time. “It’s great fun, but it does take a lot of time to get everything done,” she said. And in the run-up to the opening, Sarah was told to give people plenty of time in the lifts and to get out of bed so they could get into the lifts. She said the lifts could be a bit tricky for first-timers because they could get stuck, but after doing it the first time, she became much faster at it. It also meant she could spend more time in the chalet area. When she started, there were 82 people staying in the hotel. Now, there are 94. Sutherland-Pilch has been doing the job for two years. She had the job last summer but she quit after the first two weeks. Her boss says she’s used to her job because the people she works with are so good and there’s always a new challenge. “You could tell they’ve had experience... because they look so relaxed. So they have a certain amount of confidence and are friendly and approachable,” Sutherland-Pilch said. Last year she had more guests because she had more hours than the other girls. But she said the job can still be demanding. “As well as cooking, you have to be responsible for your own health and safety. You go into the cabin one night and there’s a fire and you need to make sure the fire is in good condition before you go to bed. I had to check it was safe to do that, because the room is not air-conditioned. You have to check your own shoes, hat, gloves and so on. I didn’t go down to the reception room to get the fire started. It’s quite an exciting job. ”If you’re a big girl you’ll probably want to do something a bit more glamorous,” she said. “It’s a lot of hard work. “You have to be strong, strong, strong. And you have to be really good at what you do because you might not know anything else, which means you can’t know what’s going on in a kitchen. It is a hard job but the people you work with and the places you’ll stay in will provide a warm and welcoming environment. “It’s always fun and nice to get to know other people,” she said. “There are a few funny bits too. “There’s always people I bump into while cleaning or doing other jobs but it’s nice to meet new people. Usually it’s just the other girls, but it’s lovely to get to know them. And one of my favourite things is when you say ‘what is your favourite thing about being a chalet girl’ because when you do it then you have to take it to the next level and that’s really cool, you have to ask them how it’s done, if it’s all done by you or if it’s up to them. Luckily I have a few good people I can turn to when I need people to be there. “There’s a lot of them, and they are all really lovely. I find that when I am working on a chalet, you’re on holidays all of the time. You’re really enjoying it and it makes you happy. “I enjoy going to the hotel and working there. You’re working in the restaurant so it’s nice to be back in the kitchen and have a cup of tea and a biscuit and something warm. And you’re also doing a lot of stuff that you wouldn’t otherwise do.” She said she had to take on more responsibility after first time because she got stuck. The most rewarding part of her job is being able to use your skills to do","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is 24 and she has a dream job: she’s a chalet girl, and she likes it. But it’s not always easy. The chalet girl has to deal with the fact that there are other girls there, and not all are friendly. So she goes off to the bar once in a while to chat to other girls, while also dealing with the fact that the chalet is in the mountains, in France. To help out with the jobs at a chalet in the French Alps, Sarah has to sign a contract to work for an organisation called “Trips, Transfers and Tours of Switzerland”. Sarah says if a customer doesn’t enjoy themselves, she’ll have to look for a new job. It isn’t all roses, however. If a guest isn’t happy, she says there’ll be other issues. Keeping the holiday-makers happy is part of Sarah’s job. The chalet is set up in one of Switzerland’s most popular mountain resorts. With a lot of people coming from France, it is one of the busiest times of the year. Sarah says she has made some great friends, as well as getting to know the customers well. She says she has learnt what is expected of her in the way of behaviour, and also what is expected of her as a person. For example, when guests arrive, they must be made to feel welcome in the chalet, and they have to do things like give them a tour of the resort and explain the snow conditions, the ski school, the village and how they can get around the resort. Sarah says that for most of her time at the chalet she works in the kitchen, where she prepares delicious meals for all the guests, which includes making a full breakfast and lunch every day, as well as some tasty afternoon and evening treats for guests. “You have to prepare a lot of food, especially on the first night, when it’s really hot outside,” she says. “You have to cook for a lot of people and you have to be really good at cooking to make sure everyone has a nice breakfast and lunch and people aren’t hungry when they come back in the evening. She is very organised as far as cleaning is concerned. “The chalet can get quite busy when people are coming in on snowy and cold days, so they’re very stressed, and they want everything to be perfect. It is not always easy, but Sarah says being in the outdoors keeps her happy.","Keeping the holiday-makers happy is the second year running for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch from West Sussex. She is happy if her guests are happy, but only when they are safe, fed and fed well, and if they have had a good time. Sarah, who works for a ski school in the French Alps, tells Veronica Lee: ""We are very lucky we get two weeks off a season, to make sure people are happy but that doesn't mean we have a holiday for ourselves."" Although the Swiss ski school had a high death rate last year, Sarah had to be careful she stayed away from the resort. But although her role is to keep the guests safe, she often has her own personal duties. Sarah says: ""A chalet girl's job is never done."" Sarah says: ""You have to have time off to go home, to do your own laundry and put on your own clothes. ""I am pretty strict about my appearance."" Sarah has been working in ski resorts for two years now. At the age of 24, Sarah, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is hoping her experience will inspire others and help them to see a different side of life, in the Swiss resort of Verbier in the French Alps. ""It is a very hard job but I love every part of it,"" she says. ""It is a big responsibility but everyone has to do it because that is how it is."" Sarah says: ""In our job we are constantly helping others so you have to take care of those people and they're going to need you. I also like to work with animals."" As well as looking after the guests' belongings, a chalet girl can help to keep the chalet tidy. Sarah describes how she cleans, disinfects, launders and cleans the floors. ""It is always a mess,"" she says. ""But you have to clean those floors and the kitchen to keep it tidy."" It is also important she is prepared for the food, she adds: ""I have a good recipe book which I always go to, like my dad has a good one and I use it every day."" Getting the equipment is the biggest challenge for Sarah. ""There is a cookery school there and every week they bring someone in so it's always a bit of a challenge,"" she says. ""You have a set of ingredients that you have to use. It’s not like it's like putting up a tent - you have to clean everything up when you do it."" Sarah also has a lot of experience with catering, having worked at restaurants in her home town as a teenager. She adds: ""It is a bit of a challenge at the beginning, but you get used to it. You become very efficient. ""I get very used to it, as the years go by it becomes second nature."" Veronica Lee is a writer and photographer who enjoys working in mountain environments, having been on the slopes with her two husbands for two years.","This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Her work is never done - but that doesn’t mean her life is easy. The winter in the Italian Alps is tough. Luckily, Sarah doesn’t miss it. “For most of the day I am sleeping on a bed that has been prepared by me,” she explains. “There is a towel and the bedclothes are laid out neatly. “But then when I come in the room and the room is quiet, the bedclothes are everywhere and there are a few little bits of paper thrown on the floor.” So a good night’s sleep is crucial. She also needs to make delicious dinners for the holidaymakers - not to mention help out the Alps ski instructors. “It is a lot of work but it is absolutely delicious,” she says. In between making beds and delicious dinners, Sarah works full-time at her resort to get a part-time job working part-time with the Alps ski school, as well as working weekends for a family in Italy. The chalet-girls are tasked with helping to run the school for a week at the end of the summer, but the girls also have to earn a wage so they can go home at the end of the summer. “I have been chalet-girling since I was 20 years old,” she says. “I remember my first ski lesson very vividly and remember my dad saying ‘I don’t want to be a chalet girl again’. “I was about eight when I first got to the Alps and I remember being terrified of heights. I’ve got twins and a baby in the house and I’m terrified of heights. “My first snowball fight when I was 17 was a huge hit but now I think that I wouldn’t mind one at all. It’s the summer holidays at the moment. When it’s cold and snowy, I love to sit outside and I also love to ski. “It’s one of the most beautiful places on Earth and I love spending time there,” Sarah says. She’s been skiing since she was nine, when she got to France with her family, and fell in love with it. “The mountain is magical,” she says, “there is a beauty to it and there are so many different things you can do in it. “It’s definitely a challenge as the hill is steep and there’s lots of mountains. “It’s quite exhausting because you have to keep yourself in really good shape. It’s a bit of a physically demanding job, and I also get tired quickly. “The slopes can be quite steep and there’s lots of people so you have to make sure you keep yourself safe.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch (right) chats to Veronica Lee of The Guardian before her second year as a chalet girl.

The 24-year-old from West Sussex explains what it’s like to be a chalet girl. The 24-year-old from West Sussex explains how chalet girls make their beds, cook the evening meal, serve the evening meal and clean up after themselves. What’s more, chalet girls look after the tourists and have fun, too, for both the chalet manager and the guests. Chalet girls have a lot of different tasks to do while on holiday. They cook, look after the guests and take them to the slopes.","A chalet girl’s job is never done. There is always something to do – from making beds and preparing food, to taking kids out on ice slides and rescuing skiers – or simply greeting and greeting holiday-makers. Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is one of thousands of women who work as chalet girls in France. For the most part, the role is full-time for her and she often has a couple of days off every week - but she always works between 10am and 5pm. On a typical day, she will clean the chalet, clean the bathrooms and do laundry, along with other jobs that involve interacting with holiday-makers. After all that, she is often the first person their holidaymakers see after dark. She says she has a lot of respect for the resort owners because they work hard to maintain a high standard of service.","Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old who is studying to become a chef. When Sarah went to an open-air cookery school in New Zealand she learnt lots of new skills, such as how to bake cakes, make cakes and bake chocolates. Now she works as a chalet girl, keeping the holiday-makers happy. And her best bit? Making sure all the beds are made, the breakfasts are good and the dinners are delicious. In between, the 24-year-old makes beds and cooks delicious food, all for a £100 a week. She’s also happy to take orders and, even though she didn’t want to, now she’s used to balancing the books. She says: “When it’s hard, you don’t want it to be harder than it is. You want the customer to enjoy themselves.” The 24-year-old was born and raised in West Sussex, and started skiing at the age of 12. Initially, she thought it was too difficult – but soon found out that the slopes weren’t too bad. “It’s not hard to do but you get used to the altitude. When I first started it was really difficult because I had never skied in my life,” she says. “After a few days, I found that the slopes were not particularly challenging and I really enjoyed it. “There was also the fact that I didn’t want to be a chef and I didn’t want to work outdoors. “My family had only ever been skiing with me once – and they had a great time. “My parents loved the skiing and I think they were amazed by the experience. “I loved it because I couldn’t ski, but I loved being in a chalet. My brother has always wanted to be a chef. “It’s always a massive responsibility."

B2,"The sport of netball is one of the fastest-growing in the world. It can be played at almost every level of the game, and is an incredibly diverse sport. I chatted to one of England’s captains, Kendra Slawinski, about her day – which included teaching at a local primary school and a training session in the local supermarket car park. We also went to a local gym for a cardio session, and an unmissable lunchtime meal, before the next thing we knew we were back at a supermarket car park. She explained that she’d been training hard for six weeks, and the last couple of days she’d been having ‘really tough’ days. She said that she’d been working on her core strength – her core muscles, which make up her body – to give herself the best chance of being in the best form for the World Championships, which start in Brisbane next month. When we met, she was in the middle of a training session in her local supermarket car park – the perfect day. It was very cold, and she'd had a wet morning, so we decided to go outside for a spin. We were surrounded by a crowd of around 300 people. Normally we'd wear our tracksuits, but I wore a polo shirt and my training outfit, so it was nice to be in one place with people my age. It was also a way for us to keep a good rhythm going, as we were constantly stopping to talk and chat. It's a way for us to feel part of the team, and for others to see us as more than just a team. I got to talk to some of the other England captains, who couldn’t understand why the game was so popular in the UK, and to get to know them better. We'd never played netball before, so it was a great way to get to know them – we were basically just sitting in the same room and just talking. There was an added element of getting into the rhythm of the game, because England doesn't have a team coach. So one of the things I was trying to understand was why we didn't have one. It turned out to be something very important to us. Our coaches are men. We have only got one coach. And he’s just a man. We've got a man in our captain who we call Dave. If we go through each other, we're a one-team family. It means we're close. If we’re not together, we are on our own. We have to deal with everything, we're on the team together. That's a lot to put in, but a lot to put into the game too. We've been doing it for years and years, and you think that you’re not getting the respect you deserve because it’s not like being a woman. It's not just about winning. It’s about the relationships. It’s about doing things together. And then they just pay off. We're doing it for the sport – we’re doing it for the sport. It’s about the team. It’s about making sure we’re winning. It’s the work we do to be top of the world. We do things that no one has ever done. We are leading the world. We’ve got a really good coaching team, and we have an incredible team of players from around the world coming to our country to represent our country and for that we should be really proud. When I first started playing netball, I'd never ever played an organised game, so I was obviously a bit nervous about it. And to come back to it, I remember how hard it was, especially in the early days. I was learning how to pass and shoot, I was learning the game, I was trying to read what was going on. I remember thinking we had to win. I remember our team losing. The boys were playing and I was thinking it would be a good opportunity for us. I remember thinking we had the chance to win and I knew it. I just didn’t realise at the time how hard it is. But I got it, and I got it. So it's not just about winning, it’s about being the best version of yourself that you can be. And there was this young man called Dave. He got up to make a goal in the final. I wasn't sure he was going to make it, but I had faith in him. I’d been working on his game, getting him to that point. He was trying so hard","Kendra Slawinski teaches English at a local school before training alongside her club side, Manchester Phoenix, in the weeks leading up to the World Championships in Australia. After she gets home she has a quick cuppa at the local pub where she talks about how the sport has benefited the community in which she lives. One of England's most important sports stars, she lives her life on a daily basis and tries to fit as many hours as possible into her day. She's also a part-time coach who has been teaching netball for a year. Kendra doesn't think it's a great job to be a coach, even though she's a'super star' in the sport. She talks about how there isn't enough space in netball training camps for every aspiring player. She also looks forward to how the sport has changed, as women have started playing and expressing their voices and ideas. England's netball captain told Suzie Ellis how when women first started playing, they were encouraged by their peers, which she thought would be a better environment for young girls to play on. She doesn't believe it will be any different in Australia. She says England still struggle to attract people to the sport, as the majority of girls are still girls. Currently it's the most popular sport in the world, and over the last few years the sport has had its best ever year with England - and Kendra - winning their first major tournament in Melbourne last month. To be a captain in the sport means you have to make every minute count. For Kendra the most challenging part of the job is the amount of travelling she's required to do in order to play in the tournament, plus the fact she's only 20 years old. While she says she has been training with her team for more than three years, she's been playing since 2012. She plays netball in the Women’s Super League and is a member of the Manchester Phoenix, so is the only English player that plays both ends of the game. ""We've been doing this for about eight years now. We can't really afford not to do that,"" she says. ""You can't afford to just pop up and play."" Slawinski, a forward who started playing netball when she was just nine years old, has been in the England team since 2010 and has made the Great Britain squad twice. She played in the World Cup in 2016 before making it to the semi-finals. In 2016 she became the youngest player in the history of netball to win the Grand Final after beating Australia. Her team won by a margin of seven points against South Korea. At 18 she competed in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. When she turned 23 she made the final and went on to win the gold medal - something that has been a dream of hers. She says: ""I’ve had my fair share of injuries so I’ve struggled. The last few years have been tough because the injuries have slowed me down a lot. ""My biggest frustration has been the mental side of things as I get older. ""Whilst the playing side is a part of my life, I’ve really had to focus on my mental health in order to stay ahead. It’s hard not to compare myself with others because we are all pushed to achieve so much by this sport.""","She's a tough cookie. After a full day's teaching at a local school, Kendra Slawinski had a ten-a-side training session in the local supermarket car park, with her squad. She says it's helped her become a leader. At a time when the sport is often considered an unhealthy sport, it has helped her become more focused and approachable, and she's proud to say she's become the first woman in Britain's team to captain. England take on Australia in the quarter-finals on Friday – a match that could decide whether England or Australia will play for the gold medal – in Perth, Australia. But for Kendra, it's more than just sport. She's an outstanding teacher, a keen runner and a dedicated wife and mother. A member of the National Union of Teachers since 2011, she's also a teacher trainer and an entrepreneur, and runs a small business with her husband, who has taken her on as a board member, a role she hasn't regretted. ""It's been great being part of a community, but I still get my work done,"" she says. ""I love my job and I'm just so grateful I get to go to work and be able to use my qualifications. ""When I go to work in the morning, everyone is really friendly and happy to see me so I can be really productive.""","You're not allowed to go up the netball court and touch the ball if it's painted up, you know. In the series on women in sport Suzie Ellis went to meet England’s netball captain. Kendra Slawinski is captain of England’s netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month’s World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. She also takes on a coach’s role, and her day typically starts with dinner at home. Then it’s all about going to the gym with her coach after work. This is a sport that's all about hard work, discipline, and sacrifice. It's a sport that demands a lot from you - both mentally and physically. You need to be able to adapt well to every circumstance. I couldn’t imagine being a teacher and going out to training everyday - although it's not unusual to have to do that sometimes. My coach is really good at explaining things, and he's the kind of person you can always talk to and they'll take you seriously. He gives you all the support you need. At training, there are always three other girls with you - I've got two of my friends playing here too - so it’s good to go out and do some training and see some other people, even if they're not on the team. You're not expected to win every ball that you touch, but what you do need to do is keep your head up and try to focus on the game. And if things don't go to plan, then you may not be able to play that day. So I try and be as disciplined as I can be as a teacher. I always say that netball is not for everyone - I played it my whole life and I was too scared, too nervous to try, because I thought I couldn't win! I wasn't a great player and I wasn't the fastest player, so it was really important to get myself ready for the World Championships so I could play for England against Australia and win. You can't just look at yourself and be at ease. You need to play your game and do your best. You can't think about other things while you play. And you can't look at the ball because you're trying to score. You just have to keep focussing on the ball and try to stay calm. You just have to try and keep trying. You just have to try and keep doing the right thing. If you fail to do that, you're going to have a bad performance. This is a sport with a strong male-female partnership. You need to learn from each other. Sometimes they give each other support, which is good. When you get a goal, you have to help that person make it.","The last time England played, there were only eight women in the side. In the years since, there’s been an explosion of women taking the sport seriously. But when we met with Kendra Slawinski, England’s national netball captain, we found the numbers pretty staggering: there are nearly 600 women in the national team, and the number is expected to grow to 1,000 by the time the World Championships come around. After all the talk about female dominance in sport, Kendra told me her typical day is a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. She’s been leading England’s national netball team to World Championship glory since 2004. As such, she has come to know how to lead a team and manage it well. So far in her career, she’s also held the role of coach, coach trainer and team manager. So far this year, England have won five World Cups and three Olympic titles. We met up with Kendra at a supermarket car park near her local school to chat about her days and what has helped make them so successful. In particular, what she likes most about working with girls is the way that it teaches important life lessons like team work and how important being a team is. Netball also gives her a chance to work with young people in a sport she has a passion for. She reflects, “I’m a typical mum with four kids; I’m a teacher and a husband – you’ve always got a little bit of each. We’ve been doing netball for a couple of years now but I didn’t really see the potential when I was younger. I wasn’t sure how to achieve the goals that I had in school”. When I was younger, I didn’t think about what it would feel like to score a goal. I was too focused on scoring lots of goals, hitting the hoop and defending. I thought I couldn’t do it because it would be harder. Then when I was eighteen I started playing netball for my school and I started training with the national team. Despite how much fun and easy it was, I still got the hang of things quickly. I started hitting, passing and dribbling. My coach was very supportive as I started to work at university so I started to gain confidence. When I started playing for university, I had to be really good at defending to get a shot at goal. That helped me. Then when I was 17 I got injured and was out for eight months. I decided to refocus and became a bit more focused on the sport. In that time I became a more confident defender and started being more aggressive. I was starting to learn what to do with the ball. The next thing I remember, was being the first netball captain in British history to get injured. It was the same with my school, and I didn’t even want to go there. I just thought that I wanted to play. I wasn’t really into the sport at that time. I started at UCD studying music and I loved it but I didn’t really follow a team. That’s when I realised I wanted to play for England so bad that I joined the team. I became captain – the only one who’d ever been captain. I started by doing some teaching, which I did well in. I also started playing netball a couple of years ago because of my coach. Then I made the jump to university, graduating last year with a master’s degree. I knew I wanted to make a go of the sport. I knew I wanted to play and I just did it. I was a bit shy in the beginning but I realised I wasn’t scared. The team is incredible. I’m a bit nervous about playing against some of the best teams in the world, but I want to win. Taking the netball into school is a big deal. To be part of the national team has changed so much, so if I can make it to my final match in the final of the world championships, I will. I also want to make it to the end of the season – so I know the next few months will be a busy time. I’m just a normal mum, trying to do everything I can for my children and helping them become successful people in a sport that they’re passionate about, is there any advice you’d offer a woman who wants to get on the national team? It’s something I’ve tried to do since I was younger too. If I’m being honest, I haven","England netball captain Kendra Slawinski has said she hasn’t been to a netball tournament since she was a child but she wants to go next month. Her typical day is a day’s teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. She says the biggest difference with her childhood was the time she spent playing at school. When she was young the game didn’t really take off and she’d hardly played in years. “It’s really different when you’re older and people think ‘what do they do?’ it’s really different,” she says. The 27-year-old’s first taste of netball came when she was in secondary school. Her brother and sister were also involved in netball and she played at school. Despite the fact that she didn’t play again until she was 18, she’d been a netball fan since she was five and is now England’s captain. The sport grew up around her in her small town and it’s something she takes great pride in. “It was just something that got in my blood to play netball and I think that’s how I got into it,” she says. Before moving to London to study, she was a mermaid nurse for six years and now teaches English at a local secondary school.","Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England’s netball team.

B2,"I have tried reading a full newspaper, or even the front page of a news website, and it's practically impossible, unless you've done it for a while. It's especially difficult to keep up with the endless news alerts and notifications that are piled up as we're still recovering from the global meltdown of 2008. If there's any kind of news that is breaking on social media, the number is uncountable. This time last year, Facebook announced that more than 460 million people had received a notification for new news — the same number that reportedly got people tweeting, or posting to a Google+ post. News is arguably one of the most valuable sources of information for news junkies. But it can also leave news junkies feeling overwhelmed. The Wall Street Journal, for example, reports that more than 100 million people have signed up for a news app — and over 30 million have downloaded an app. When people are crammed for time on social media, they tend to go to one of three major news outlets. Reuters alone puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. Reuters only reports stories that have been verified, screened and archived. The Wall Street Journal has nearly 500 million followers on Facebook. It also has nearly 200 million followers on Twitter. And this is just one source, not including Twitter. It's not just social media that’s getting on our nerves. We have to be mindful of the fact that even with a lot of data on the internet, we still haven’t figured out how to sort it all out. A number of large businesses have recognized that we have a problem. We have launched the Social Media Archive Project, which gives you the ability to read your email, browse your social media profiles and see how others have read the news of the day. The archive includes an exhaustive list of some of the most read news articles on Facebook as well as details on the source and the journalist who wrote it. The project also includes a list of journalists who have written for the Wall Street Journal. The first step for the project is to take a look at all of the websites that have been sharing their readers. They use a variety of tools and analysis methods to narrow down the resulting list to the news that’s most likely to be of interest. They also evaluate where the news story originated in the world, and if it might be worth revisiting it. Lastly, the project also analyzes the frequency that certain stories are shared. They then use the results of the analysis and their own data to determine if this trend is continuing. You can watch the full panel discussion here.","...and you might ask yourself... what's the point? A few years ago, I was a journalist in a small South African town. We were reading the Sunday papers when a war broke out in Northern Angola. When I asked my boss if he knew about the war – his answer was “not that I knew”. How did I know that? He told me that I was too busy talking with friends and family to see the news. And if I did see the news I knew it would either go right to press or get lost in my Twitter feed. Then one day he said: “I’m not going to read the paper any more. I’m getting the news online.” And, he said to himself: “So far I’ve managed to do that.” Well, for all of us, it’s almost impossible to follow every piece of news that appears on the front page of a news website. The problem, he pointed out, is that many of these pieces of news are inaccurate. For example, the news website Reuters said that there were five dead babies in Paris from the French Revolution, but in fact there were seven. Reuters said that it was the first time it had ever published a story wrongly quoting an astronomer who had said in a paper that there were seven baby deaths. However, Reuters’ headline said: 'We've got a lot of work to do to get all that data right for every single story that has to make it to the website.' And so it decided to do an experiment: It gave three hundred real newspapers a chance to read Reuters’ headline and see which story got the most attention. Then it asked those same newspapers to make a report that predicted the amount of news in each newspaper. The authors found that when each newspaper had an article right off the top of its page, it would only take readers a little over two minutes to read all the stories. So it calculated that if newspapers had the headline ""Recent News Stories In The UK"", the figure for the UK would be: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published a headline that said: This newspaper published ","Reuters puts out 3.5 million news stories a year. And that's just one source. If you want to see what news your friends or family are reading, you can check their Twitter or Facebook feeds. There's also a growing trend to turn to information from a new source, instead of getting all of your news from a single source. One way to do this is to turn to social media. Facebook is the most popular social media platform, followed by Google+, Snapchat, and LinkedIn. And there's even a dedicated Google+ page called ""Instagram for news"". The biggest challenge is still finding the right balance between real-time information and your daily news intake.

Mcfarlane was quoting an interview with journalist and broadcaster Nigel Farage where he discussed the nature of the news business. For instance: ""If you're a regular reader of the newspaper, how do you eat breakfast, how do you find time to do some research before reading the news?"" and ""How do you learn about the latest tech gadget or invention, from the latest gossip to the latest celebrity gossip to the latest technology?"" Mcfarlane says that he was inspired to write about this because he thought the world needed some ""reflective journalism."" He wanted people to consider why they read a particular piece of news and what it meant to them. He then restructured the writing and focused on the core message of the story and left out the unimportant detail. For instance, in a recent piece about Donald Trump, Farage said: ""It doesn't matter whether he gets a million views, whether he gets 1,000 people to read it; what matters is whether the message gets through.""","At present it seems we are living in the age of constant, uncontrollable, news saturation. However, researchers from Stanford University have claimed that the new digital age is breaking through the constraints placed on us by our sedentary lifestyles and overcrowding. According to Reuters, the average person has only 7 minutes to read an average newspaper a day. While the study did suggest that some people are able to read all their favourite news in just 4 minutes, those who read less than 20 minutes a day are far more likely to say they don't know anything. Researchers in the UK also believe the news culture is a key driver of the current rise in the number of news addicts. According to a study in the International Journal of Psychophysiology, in which people were asked to select the news they would like to consume they found that half of people choose the news they know nothing about. The other half chose the news they do know. This was reflected in their moods and sleep patterns. One thing they didn't account for was how the news was accessed. ""For almost all of us, our news comes in chunks, and we're likely to consume up to 15 chunks a day,"" said Professor Chris McMullen, an assistant professor at Stanford. ""We don't want to read every single piece of news out there. If you do, then you might have to do some work on your own or pay to get a few articles emailed to you. So, it's not a problem in and of itself; it's the fact that it's getting in the way of our lives.""",We are literally drowning in news.

B2,"The story that inspired us to write this article was one that I wrote myself. I also had other people write for the article and I thought I had a nice story, so I decided to turn the article into a story. It may not seem like it, but it is a very good story. The story is very involving and there are twists, turns and a lot of drama. My only advice would be don’t be too proud of it and to let it go and just keep writing it, if it’s good, it will be published. It is never too early or too late to write a story, you just have to start. 1. Go to your local library.: If you have a library, go and have a look at a couple of the books they have in stock. This is a great way to get an idea of what is out there. The shelves usually have some of the most current books in their collection. Look through the shelves at your library and ask them if there’s anything you want to read. If there’s any book that you just feel has a special place in your heart or maybe it’s something you’ve always wanted to know more about, talk to them. The library may have access to all these things and they will be able to tell you how to get your story published. If not they will be happy to suggest other places that you can try and find some interest. 2. Visit a writers’ agency.: Some writers’ agencies have a very helpful section online that will tell you what writers are looking for and whether or not they are a good fit for you. Try to spend half an hour on it – this gives you an idea of what they are looking for and if they want to publish it. If you’re not on the list of people you want to speak to, then try to find out if there’s anyone that can help you out and perhaps there’s something there for you, especially if your story is aimed at young writers. For example, one of the top young writers’ magazines is called YWAM, or Young Writers’ Army. It is a weekly magazine for under-25s. There are some writers’ workshops you can sign up to. There are many writing classes, you can take a writing course or write a book. Try to keep a list of writing groups and events in your area, as they might know about writers’ groups in your area. 3. Send your story to an agent.: If you are sending to an agent, you’ll need to have a good relationship with them – it’s not a one-off. Getting published can take time, money and a lot of hard work. Many publishers will only accept your story if it is original and hasn’t been published elsewhere. Try and choose your best agent first. You’ll need to decide whether they’re the right agent for you. Often these agents are writers themselves, with writing experience. It can be tricky to work with an agent, especially if you’re writing in a genre that doesn’t have a lot of competition. It’s worth spending time chatting with them and getting to know them. Don’t give your agent all the information about your manuscript, as it can take some time for them to get back to you. 4. Don’t send it to an agent just yet.: Agents will read manuscripts by mail. This is best for the first month after you submit your story, to get a feel for the editor. Send the writer a sample of your work and see if they like it. Sometimes you can do the same thing over the phone, and that will be fine. It will be worth it to see if you get a response. If you only have the one page of your story, that can be enough to send your story, unless you have other things that you want to try. Don’t wait too long as this will be a bit of work and you don’t want to rush it. If you don’t get a reply, you’ll need to move onto the next section. Don’t wait to see the editor either – he/she will be very busy assessing your manuscript, and they will only give you feedback if you’re good enough. 5. Send your story to an editor you know.: It’s always a good idea to have a good relationship with the editor you are writing for. Don’t send to a publisher and then come back later and complain that they didn’t respond. It would be easy for a publisher to get upset at you if you’re not","Do you want to be published?

She regularly edits Short Story Collection and the Short Story Month magazine, and has written a book on how to get published. You can read more on her website: www.margaretstubbs.co.uk","There are two kinds of people in this world - those who are writers and those who aren't. When they write, they're writing about some kind of subject, something they feel passionate about. However, they're also often writing to tell stories about the world they live in. When you submit a story to a publication it's called querying (requesting) because you're pitching it to them for publication. As the name implies, querying is about trying to get your story published. If you submit it to one of the following publications, they will let you know if your story was selected or not. As mentioned in the magazine's article, the publishers will use their discretion to decide whether or not to publish your story or not. Many of them will also have their own'submit' or rejection policy, so check those as well. Remember: if your story doesn't make it to the publisher, they won't publish it either. Writers often get published because they have an engrossing story, a great plot, or a unique message. You need to have something compelling to hook readers to buy your story. Here are some examples of stories that are readable by Grade 2 learners: When I moved to New Zealand I had three dogs. My husband bought me a dog with a name. The first day I brought it home it was my best friend's birthday. I spent the whole weekend with her, going out with her to visit with her. When the dog got loose, we went to the dog park and played with it for a bit. One day, the dog's name was Miss. Miss Iggy had an aversion to the word, and wanted to slap it on Miss Iggy's hand. But I think it was sweet. I read and re-read the story because I think it's a fun story and it was also a good way to keep my mind active. In the end, the dog's name was Squirt. Squirt was also very popular with the children in the park. I have a story about Squirt and how she lost her name.

B2,"Mitch started walking back to his office. There on the floor was a young woman wearing a pink robe, wearing black pants and white socks and a purple sweater. The woman couldn't have been Avery because she was a nurse. Besides, Avery wasn't supposed to be in her office after 11 PM. In the morning he called and informed his coworkers that Avery had left a long message on the answering machine for two hours. He said that he was sorry for what he had done. But he was not going to tell the rest of the office. They just assumed he was sleeping in his office because he was not in his office. Avery had no way of knowing that, but he could not leave the building, and it wouldn't stop him from stealing it. Now that he is a free man, he is free to run away, if he wants. Avery took him back to the office and they began packing up. Avery reinstalled his security system. Mitch was one of the first to get back into the office. His bosses didn't even know he was gone until the next morning when they saw the security tapes.","The next morning, Avery was lying on his bed in his office when he suddenly saw two tall men coming into his office. He called to him. When he finally answered, they told him that it was a tall man from the news paper. Mitch figured that it had to be Avery who had left his office. He was quite pleased with this, because he had finally figured out who had stolen the key to Avery's office.","Mitch came back into the office and saw Avery looking around the room. Mitch had only been working there for two weeks. He told Avery that he had gone back upstairs to the same room after a long day of work and had found something. After he told him what he had found, Avery left the room. Avery then called a taxi and sped off to get somewhere safe.","Mitch was so angry that he shouted at his secretary, ""Hang on Avery!"" He rushed out of the office. He picked the lock off the desk and climbed into Avery's chair. He pulled on an old leather jacket over his shoulder. He put the key in the lock and pressed the button on the phone. He waited for the phone to ring. After about fifteen seconds Avery answered. ""Good morning my friend,"" he said as he sat back down in the chair. He smiled and said, ""You made a good point, Avery. I was going to resign anyway."" When Mitch asked Avery who had done it, he said, ""My boss.""","Mitch knew that Avery was the guilty one. His wife had already left town, but it was clear to the partner at the firm that he had been stealing for himself. Besides, Avery had never used the other key. I wonder where Avery is now.","Mitch was shocked to see Avery in the office. After a quick shower, he quickly left the building. Before he left, Mitch told everyone at work about the burglary.","Avery was very angry. Since she left him, he couldn't have slept last night. He must have had a chance to get to the firm when he was locked out."
B2,"This is what he has to say on his first day as a film critic. I’m still looking over the last ten years of my time as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. I remember the first time I wrote a film review for the paper. I remember the day the film was finally released. I remember reading a line in my first film review that said ”It’s a little bit hard to believe, but it has to be the best thing to happen in the past year”. I’d written a film review about a film I had seen, a few hours later, and then going away and seeing it again just as I started writing the review – only then, it became clear that the review was going to be about a film I had seen – the first time. It was exciting and a bit surreal because it really was the first time I’d been to see a new film. It was like I’d been there forever. In those first few days I read so many good reviews on films, that the next day, I was back to writing more, and by the end of the day, I had written over a hundred, and I started to feel like I could write a book about film criticism and even a film blog. I became one of the founding members of Screen Australia, which has now become Screen Australia News (SAU), and since that time I’ve been to Australia and New Zealand, and we have been friends. My first film review for SAU was called “Orange is the New Black”. That really excited me because it was different. It was the first film I’d seen with John Hurt – a man I’d watched with James Caan, when he was a producer, and he was a devoted film fan. There are lots of reasons I love the film – including the director. John Hurt is funny, engaging and warm. He was a really nice person. After that, I was hired by The Guardian, where I reviewed films for eight years. I loved that job; it was a dream job and it was very rewarding – not only in terms of the money, but because it was very challenging. And so in my ten years at The Guardian, I had a lot to learn. I had to learn how to think about movies – that I should make sure that I watched the right films. How I should approach movies and how I should see them. It was a job that I had to do with great responsibility. I had to think about what I was doing with words. I had to figure out how to write in a way that would attract readers. I had to learn how to get more out of the writing process than simply writing a summary. And so I found myself writing a lot. But writing in such a way that would leave people wanting more. Because of all of the above, I had to start developing what I would call “The Mark Adams Principle”. I wanted to learn more about film than I knew before. It’s still very hard to grasp how far we have come. I’m still learning to think and write about film, but I’m still having problems. The first film I wrote a piece on was ‘The Good, the Bad and the Ugly’. It didn’t take me long before I noticed that there were some parallels between writing about films and writing about my favourite books. It was hard to explain what The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was about without going over the top – especially when I was writing about an adult book. It took me some time to see how many different types of review there were, and when I realized how many different kinds of review there were, I found I needed a way to sum it up. I had to get into the swing of writing about films because there weren’t too many different types of film, and it wasn’t easy, so a lot of writing happened before, during and after the film. I didn’t know how to write reviews well and had to read a lot of different films. When it came to films I had to learn what kind of review to write – it’s still quite hard, but I’ve got better at it now. I’ve come to know how to write about the types of film that are interesting and which films I really like. The great thing about being a film critic is that it’s very hard to do all the things a journalist does – do the research. Write about what types of films are interesting, and look at ways you can review them, and write in a way that is engaging to the reader. So that","The First time I saw it was at the cinema on Christmas Day. The cinema was packed, it had raining for a few days. I hadn't realised the day before how many people were already waiting in the cinema - all wanting to see the latest release. The movie was released just before Christmas Day. The cinema had shut for about four hours for the weekend so it wasn't unusual for the queues to stretch out for hours to get into the cinema. On Christmas Eve, I drove my car across town to see it, just in case. I had read about it a week before. It was the first time I'd seen it. I was a bit of a star-struck kid. The film was good and I could see the films the reviewers had picked out for review. I was going to sit and watch with a pint of cheap beer and a packet of crisps and pretend to know what I was doing. I'd hoped that it would be a good film. I arrived at the cinema to find it was closed. I asked a steward. He said it was because he was film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. He said he would sort things out later. After a week I drove home to see what I could find. I called my wife. She is a film critic at a newspaper called The Guardian, which has the same name as the magazine I wrote for, The Guardian Film Review. She said she had read one of my reviews and liked what she saw. She asked if I would like to send her a copy of the review so she could write her own. I agreed and it was on its way to me. I had a nice coffee with the film reviewer and she asked me to send a sample of my review which I had written for her. I went into the film to find that the review was almost ready to go - but the page had to be ripped off to do so. I got to the film and it was a different story. It was a very low budget, well-worn and very poor film. There had been no trailer. It had been remade many times and the original script had been redone several times. There were no special effects. The actors looked like they had not worked in years. It was unceremoniously cut by John McTiernan. I had been asked to write an article for her last year but she wanted to have another go at it. She told me that she was going to make some changes and that she would write a review later. The editor had been worried about how the film would get received. She explained that because of the amount of hype and the commercial success of the film she was going to have to have a tough time. I had not written an article in years and I was not expecting to be asked to write one. Nevertheless, she asked me to try and give my review a little twist. After all, there are no special effects in the film. We all knew it was going to be a bad film. She had never read the review but when I told her I was going to write it she could have no doubts. She told me that I needed to come up with something new but that it had to be a film that was entirely new. She pointed out that all the other reviews had been written by people who didn't know the film. I thought I knew everything about a movie, so I did my best to prove it wrong. She said she was shocked I could tell the difference between the film and the script. The film critic Mark Adams has just finished his tenth year as a film critic at the newspaper called The Front Page. He describes how it feels to look back on all his films, including the best. He says that he has to give up the cinema to watch a film. He doesn't think it is easy because he has to sit in front of his computer and listen to a film being made. He also thinks the theatre is now'more like a museum' than a cinema. He said: 'The audience for films has changed a lot, not just because people don't go to the cinema anymore. They want to be seen. They want to be known.' He teaches film making at university and says he is often the only film critic at large teaching filmmaking at university, so he doesn't get to see as many films. He also describes the experience of leaving the cinema","That year, 2001, marked my first proper job as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. I was doing a job that was quite new and exciting, not really having any experience of being a film critic. This was particularly important because I was writing about film that had not been reviewed before. I was also writing about things that had not been made for a television or a big screen. Then in March 2001, I was lucky enough to be working on a new film that I had never seen before. I saw it for the first time with my wife and she thought it was brilliant. I was not. It was the first time that the movie that I had never seen before had crossed the line of being considered a film for publication. It was a big step. I wrote two reviews, the first for The Front Page, on the film The Big Lebowski. There were lots of others that followed. In 2001, my wife started a television show, and my two sons got their first jobs at the BBC. I was working on the film called Ishtar. It was a comedy - set in the 1950s - and had a cast that included Peter Cushing, a famous actor who wrote his name on the stars of Ishtar. I did a feature story on this for a couple of months. Then things went quiet. The film had been made in China, and my wife had decided that we should not be taking our son to see it. It was in the theatre when we arrived, but when we got there, we saw it had been made in China. The film had not been made in the UK. We called the studios to complain. I was called off by my editor and told I would not be getting any more reviews, and it was at that point that I realized I had no choice but to quit. I left the job with The Front Page, and the next month we were told that my pay would not be as high as I had been doing as a film critic. My wife did not think that was a good idea, and asked to have my salary reduced for the remainder of the year. After a month of the cuts, he did say that I could stay on as film critic, which I did. One thing I did not mention when I left was that I was working with a TV company on television programmes. I wrote about programmes, like Doctor Who, on BBC TV, a job that I would have had if I had not been a film critic. As an independent television station, we had a budget that would have been enough for the broadcasts, and at the time I was not sure what I would do with it. But that meant that it had to be a job I could do. I had to say yes. And we did. But we had to negotiate with the local TV station about what we should cover - i.e. a programme about the BBC. The BBC said that it had seen the first four programmes, and had decided that they would be the best programme to show on television that year. The programme that week was The One Show, which was a programme describing life in a hospital, but was also about the people that work there. It included interviews with the local surgeons, hospital staff and doctors who were doing what they could to try to help patients - for instance, the surgeons did a lot of work on the show. I had to agree, because it was the only programme we had on that week. So we had to agree - on the evening of the programme, it was broadcast during the afternoon as an hour-long programme. I remember I had only seen it once before in the theatre - the show was called Ishtar. The audience were a lot older than the ones at the theatre - over 40. They'd voted for the show by now, so it was a fairly big ask for the audience to like a film made in China. So my next review was a review of the film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote and also of the film Les Miserables. We also had an article about the Oscars and the film industry itself. And the news about my wedding had the headline: 'Do you want to be a film critic?' It was a big deal for a number of reasons. The movie had been made in China, and had its premiere there - we didn't have to go to the cinema because the show was broadcast at our local cinema. The biggest change happened in the late 1990s when I began to do interviews with people for the radio. I started to do interviews with people who were famous for their jobs","The Front Page magazine was my first job as a film critic. I had been looking for a job in journalism for a long time, and it was a good place to start my career. I was able to take a risk that I would love doing this for a living. The first 10 years of my career have gone by quite quickly and I don’t feel like I’ve even started. I’m really proud to have lasted this long, and I think that if you look back on your work you’ll see that it has been a great experience. I still genuinely enjoy going to the movies. It’s not a very glamorous job, but I do enjoy going to the movies.","The Front Page was the first newspaper I worked for. I didn't know anything about newspapers at the time so I was really surprised to get a job in the film department. The staff were friendly and helpful and they were very receptive to new ideas. The main problem was that there was only so much of a film programme in the UK so I was given a very limited amount of film to choose from. I didn't feel confident at first but I got used to writing about different genres of films and soon there were things that I didn't like. I realised that The Front Page was about reviewing films of the quality they should be made rather than trying to be as provocative as possible and writing about a wide range of themes and subtexts. After a while I started to write about film genres outside the main categories that the paper covered. I started to write reviews for films that I didn't know, even if they were of the right quality. My first book was called How to Write a Book Reviewing: Movies. I got the book published in 1992 and the next year I wrote a book about reviewing films. I had a lot of fun with my book, but it didn't take off. Writing the book took a lot longer than I would have hoped. It wasn't until I finished the book and gave it to my editor that I found a specialised publisher who took an interest in my book and offered me a contract. I was so grateful for the support and that I have kept going. I know that the book sold well and that I've sold tens of thousands of copies since it was published. The book was also good for my writing skills. Once I had my book published I realised that I had a lot more to learn. I thought that I might not have had the opportunity to do so many reviews as I have done now. But the book was a lifesaver, it's good for reading and gives you an idea of what to expect next in terms of writing. At first it was tough because my first two books were written for older readers, but over time I got to write more articles for younger readers too. Writing articles has helped me understand how things work and the wider culture of film and how different cultures are represented in film. Moreover, the process of writing gives you an insight into filmmaking at the time and gives you an idea of how the film industry and Hollywood worked. I have got to know the people, - directors, writers and actors. I have learned that everyone has different tastes. This is why I love the job and am always keen to read as much criticism as I can get. The job has also been a source of some great friendships. Not just with other critics, but with film producers and actors as well. I get to see films I would never have if I wasn't working for The Front Page. For me, writing is like writing a book - it's a combination of two different skills, both are useful for getting good reviews. When I started working for The Front Page, I was very surprised that the paper had started to look for authors for its review section. As soon as they read my book I asked them to consider doing an interview. I hoped that by having the interview I could get a good read from their words and hopefully help them to find something positive in the film industry. And that has happened! My article on 'A Christmas Carol' won the Best Film Writer award at the 'Gay Awards' last year, and we did an interview on 'The Last King of Scotland'. I don't know whether it will get any awards next year or not, but I'm glad that it did. It was only a couple of years ago that I started thinking about other things I did. When I was writing my book a few years ago I wrote about a new film I had not seen, the second best film in the world. But I can't say that it would have topped the first two films. I am not too sure that I could do a film like that again now. I also don't think I could write a book if I had to. I don't really think there is anything wrong with trying to do a book if you like the subject. I think it is hard enough being a film critic. Especially considering that you're a trained journalist","So, when I started writing articles about films for The Front Page in February 2003, I had no idea what I was doing. My idea of reviewing was reading something from the screen - and arguing what it meant. In my first article, I made a case that X-Men: First Class was the last film I would ever want to watch again. I didn't want to go to the cinema if I couldn't see it again. I didn't want to go back into my room and do the same thing again. I wanted to see a new film - but this one wasn't going to be it.","I have loved my time working for The Front Page. It's been my first proper job, and the way I've been able to write and write is an odd thing. It's the best thing about my job. Sometimes I'm really frustrated that I'm doing it. I have never known how many people there are in the film industry. But at least they have given me a forum in which I can discuss the films that interest me and I can go out and see more films. It's very liberating. But I miss writing about the people. When you're writing about a cynical bigot like the man who killed his wife, it's hard to enjoy it. I'm still a bit nervous about the job though. I've never been someone who takes criticism personally and when people have got fed up I've become bitter. It's been a fun, exciting job."

B2,"Colonel Easterbrook looked at his wife with concern. 'That's odd' he said. 'This man has no knowledge of India. If he had we should have seen him on that mission last year.'

'The men who were travelling in India said they had been doing nothing. We have never been to India.' Colonel Easterbrook looked at the paper for a moment, thinking to himself 'who would have written such rubbish?' 'No one really' he said. 'And what about The Times?

But the advice offered to one woman by Kitty Doherty may have some good news for some.

She explained the situation to me in a clear, non-intimidating way."" She added: ""What I really wanted to do was something different and I started to find this in talking to people, particularly students, where I found out they'd had career advice."" She said: ""It just gave me a bit more confidence when I tried to go back to university."" She also told Radio 4 how the advice on her web site could help with jobs and personal relationships. ""It was nice to have someone that had experience on the job, who could explain things to me,"" she said. ""Someone who could talk about my experience and advice."" She says the tests have proved useful in helping her find new jobs, although she cautions against people taking them just to have another career. ""There isn't much point taking the test if you're going to be unhappy in your job,"" she said.",Kitty Doherty has always wondered why people so often choose the 'path' of least resistance. She has gone through the long process of applying for jobs and deciding to sit through a number of tests before deciding which job is the right one for her. She has gone through the hard work of preparing herself for the tests and now says the tests are a useful part of her job search.,"A careers adviser is a professional who helps people to change their jobs. They may have a number of tests available, which will identify your strengths and weaknesses and identify where you are likely to be a good fit for a new job. But you have to take the tests. Psychometrics assess the accuracy of the tests, the validity of your answers, and the reliability of the tests. The tests may be administered by a psychologist, psychologist, or consultant. You have to use your judgment. Kitty Doherty is a career adviser and writing consultant for British Psychological Society.","Kitty Doherty, a careers adviser, tells young people that you should follow what your instincts tell you.","In a recent interview with Channel 4, journalist Kitty Doherty said: “I’ve been thinking about changing careers for a while but I was afraid I wasn’t as good as everyone else. Now that I have been through all the tests at a career advie, I’ve learnt more about myself and I’ve actually changed my own mind about my career. I’ve decided to write a list of all the things I’ve achieved in the last two years.

Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. 1. It is called a'self-administered test' because you do not give a statement of your personal life. When the test is finished, a psychologist will say what you were doing well and what could be improved. This information, called a 'profile' of you, is used to make suggestions about your future. 2. It is a 'financial' test. The results of the test help a lot of companies to make more informed decisions. When an employer offers you a position, they want to see your career trajectory. 3. An interview can tell you whether you're a good fit for that position. Sometimes the interviewer will ask you for personal information such as your date of birth. But these usually don't affect the job search. 4. It is an 'economic' test. If you can't pay for it, you won't be able to do the job. It is more likely to get you into trouble than to get you the job. 5. Once the assessment is finished, the adviser will say the job you have done so far is your preferred choice and suggest any career alterations or training or education that might be suitable. 6. They can help you if you have a job with a salary that is less than your salary. 7. They can help if you have to take part in a recruitment process. 8. They can help if you have to apply for a new job. 9. They can help if you have a job with little job security. 10. They can help if you are re-training, such as when you have to take on some extra duties or re-train. 11. Careers advisers may be able to help you to gain new qualifications. 12. They might be able to help you find work experience if you have had a short spell of unemployment. 13. They can help you understand whether or not you are qualified to do a particular job."

Rachel teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. The world’s oceans are some of the deepest in the world, and they are constantly changing. The current, for example, can shift a mountain in one direction or another. What Rachel Mills likes the most about working at the bottom of the sea is that she has to look at the sea’s surface and not just at the bottom. In the ocean, she finds there are more fish than on land. She studies the chemical compounds that go into the sea water and what they do there. When Rachel first moved to the area in 2006 she went on holiday to South Korea with her partner and two children. Since then, she has lived in Southampton. Her husband is a lawyer who runs a business, and she has two children, who attend Southampton’s public schools. Rachel lives in a house that looks out over the sea. She also has two golden retrievers. When she is not at work she likes to hang around the house, and visit her friends and family. She also likes to go swimming. But it’s always cold and windy, and she prefers the water at a warmer temperature. She isn’t one of those people who enjoy being cold. On the days when it is windy and cold, she likes to swim, but she’s also a bit scared. So she tries to go with the flow. She walks quickly, and feels the slight breeze on her face and neck. She feels that a wave is coming. It is coming to the sea as soon as she starts to move. But Rachel can’t swim. She swims through the waves. On the day of her first visit, however, she decided to swim through the waves, as the current was getting too strong for her. She tried several times, but still couldn’t make it. Her partner is also a lawyer. They both like to play games, even though it is sometimes frustrating. Rachel and her husband have two children: a five-year old son and a four-year-old daughter. Their daughter, Anna, is a year old. The family also has an eight-year-old son, Jack, who is a year old. Their son, Jack, is currently learning how to swim.

The park - Fun Island in Hampshire - was awarded the highest rating in our test group, a tally which exceeded the score given in a previous group review on VisitBritain.co.uk. Our children, aged two to 10, had a great time and we couldn't fault it. The rides are fun and not too terrifying, which is a bonus. Our children's favourites were the space ride and the laser show. My youngest, aged two, enjoyed the train ride. He and the children also walked the coaster together. The soft playground was perfect for our toddler who couldn't resist pushing a ball in the bouncer. The staff are friendly and helpful and the staff are able to do more than just ride the rollercoasters. Fun Island also has a cafe, live shows and a petting farm. It can be a little more expensive than Fun Island but it is a good value park. The park hosts a festival of light, music and the famous Fun Island fireworks. All the attractions are kid-friendly and most of the rides are designed for younger children. A little bit of a trek from the bus stop, but our trip was worth it. We loved Fun Island and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The kids liked the castles and it wasn't too crowded. The price was not cheap but if you're looking for a fun day out then Fun Island is definitely worth a visit. It's close to some great family attractions including Waterworld, the zoo and the steam railway. The main downside is that there are only so many rides and activities on offer. On top of that the park is in a quiet part of Hampshire. If you're looking for a quiet day out, Fun Island might not be the place for you. Fun Island in Hampshire Fun Island in Hampshire.","Fun Island is a theme park that has an old-fashioned feel. It's run like a little village, with a few stalls, and rides that have been in the park for years. The atmosphere is very calm and relaxing. It's also a lot cheaper than other theme parks around. The kids all have a lot of fun at Fun Island, which was very nice after they had been to a big theme park. The only downside, of course, is the expensive tickets for rides.",I hope that you enjoyed this story about 'variations on a theme'. In it you can find out whether Fun Island in Buckinghamshire is a good choice for a theme park. I hope you enjoyed this story about 'variations on a theme'.,"Fun Island is a theme park that has been open to the public for 20 years and has been visited by over half a million children since opening. The only thing missing is the car parking. The park has two rides: the Haunted House and the Haunted Castle. The Haunted House has lots of haunted features but the Castle was a little boring. As for the Haunted Castle, the kids loved it but the haunted house got a little scary for my little boy, as he was afraid that he could fall down. Regardless, Fun Island is a great theme park with lots of rides. The Haunted House is the most kid-friendly of the theme parks in Britain, but Fun Island is also very large so it is definitely worth visiting if you want to ride a big roller coaster. We visited Fun Island with our daughter, Charlotte, aged 5, and her brother, Alex, aged 2. They had a really good time there. Charlotte's brother said, ""I'm going to Fun Island one day. I want to stay there all the time. I'm going to see what all the fun is about!""","Fun Island is a theme park situated in the Welsh countryside, in the North Wales town of Blyth, near Swansea. Although it offers a wide range of rides, attractions, food and other facilities, it can be a very noisy place. In fact, the theme park is full of kids running around and shouting for their mates to play with them. We, however, think it has some potential as a future family day out. We think it's a good idea to get there early in the day so that it opens before the sun comes out, since the rides are less busy. Fun Island's rollercoasters are really fun for young children, although it is not the only one. The ice slide and the water slide are particularly exciting. Despite some complaints, Fun Island is an enjoyable place to visit with young children, as it caters for their different tastes in entertainment. We have been there many times. The Burns family were pleased with Fun Island and think it's great for older children and adults too. We would certainly visit it again. The Whittles family's kids had a good time at Fun Island, though they did find the ice rollercoaster a bit scary! The Whittles family found Fun Island more fun than the others in the test. They have very young children, and found it was a great place to take them. The Whittles family's teenager was disappointed by Fun Island. The Whittles family had a great time at Fun Island, and think it's a great place for older children as well. The Whittles family loved Fun Island, but they felt it was a bit expensive. They would probably go again next year, however.","We're all big fans of theme parks, and we were excited to see Fun Island. We visited with the Burns family, and it was a blast. They had fun on all the rides. The first ride was a great ride, but after we went on, the rest of the rides were not as fun. Then we went on a rollercoaster, but we got sick before we got on it. Fun Island was great because they had everything you could want. The kids were scared by a big rollercoaster, but they loved this ride because it was much slower than you expected it to be. We saw lots of other kids running around and enjoying the rides, too. The second ride was the best ride. The boys were terrified of it. But after a while, they loved it and went on it many more times. The third ride was not the best ride because it had a bad turn. The kids liked this ride because they didn't want to ride it anymore. It was so muddy and wet. The kids loved this ride because it was so much fun. They loved the rollercoaster because it was a lot harder than what they expected it to be. When they got to the top, they sat at a table while others went on the ride. They even sang a song while they were on the ride. We loved this ride because it has some twists and turns that the kids couldn't do before. The park looked a bit old-fashioned but the kids loved it. We'll definitely go back. Fun Island was a great theme park.","Fun Island is the best theme park in Britain and we love coming back. The staff are amazing and we've made great friends. I hope we can come back next year too. The Smith family The Smiths came from England and had to get a coach and bus, they had no idea about Fun Island when they booked it. But that was not a problem. We loved Fun Island. We tried everything, and it didn't seem boring. The rides are fantastic and our children loved the water rides. They didn't miss the coaster at all. We had a great day. The Henshaw family Fun Island is the best family theme park in Britain and I love coming back. The staff are awesome and we've made great friends. We hope we can come back next year too. The Whitlock family This is the best theme park in Britain and we can't wait to come back next year too. The staff are amazing and we made great friends. We enjoyed ourselves and it's a lot of fun.

Whenever I didn't have a game, my parents would give me a book to read, and I'd always carry the book around with me. In high school, I wasn't so interested in playing soccer, and if I had a bad day I'd play my computer. I learned to play soccer at school, and I played for five years. Now, I like watching movies, and I'm a huge sports fan. I play basketball, tennis, squash, and football. I love music, and I always try to be as musically gifted as I can be. I love listening to different kinds of music - classical, funk, electronica, and electronic dance music.

Jeanette Kupfermann explains why she keeps pursuing something she loves so much. She is passionate about writing and she loves absorbing information. If she isn't absorbing something new and learning, she says she can't be happy. It's only in being happy that she can keep pushing herself and her work. B. Janet Brown: 'Energy comes from feeling that your mind hasn't just been used. There's something going on in your brain that you haven't experienced before. When I have that, I can't imagine having a job that doesn't excite me. I don't want to be stuck in a routine. I want to be able to change things. That excitement is also the biggest driving force behind my work. When I’m feeling that excitement, I feel I have got the energy to go that extra mile. I like to challenge myself. When I can make a difference to someone else, it puts me in a better place. F. Janet Brown: 'The most important aspect of energy for me is a sense of achievement.' I get energy when I see the result of my work. If I’ve done something I’m really proud of, then I feel really proud of myself. I find that if I can take some small piece of that and make it bigger, it means a lot to me. So, for me, it’s all about success. If I see something that I know I can do, I’m motivated to do it."
B2,"I was very shy at school and I always thought I’d stay that way. I remember thinking I would never be confident. I had no confidence whatsoever. But I’ve learned I can be confident now. A Jenny In a way, I’m not the best at hiding my natural shyness or anything else. As I get older, I find I’ve become more self-assured and confident. I’ve learned how to let others know that I’m okay, and that I’m not afraid of anything. You can be scared of anything, but you have to tell yourself that you’re okay. So, as I get older, I have started to think more positive. I make more friends. I speak up in meetings. I let my parents know how I am. I take opportunities to go out more. I’m more confident now, but it didn’t happen overnight. A Helen I became more confident when I realised I could actually do anything. I started going to the gym, joining a club, doing the stuff that made me laugh and just doing things that made me feel better. It wasn’t because I suddenly became more confident that I began to feel confident, it was simply because I did something that scared me. A Lucy I have always had that fear of what people may think, so I made the choice to face it head on. I started putting my head down, believing that other people were going to see me differently. A Lucy In my job I’m the person who asks questions, answers them, explains things in the way that I think is right, and then I move on. I made that decision and that became my confidence. A James I am incredibly confident now, but I struggled with confidence at school because I was always so timid. I re-learning how to speak to people and have confidence in my abilities. You may think I’m quite fearful. A John I used to be very shy, but after working hard on improving my confidence, I can’t imagine not being confident. A Paul I am not particularly confident with other people. My job is very demanding, and to be able to speak well to other people, I have to take on more responsibility. Now, if someone calls me too much I need to give myself time to calm down before giving a speech. A Julie I am very confident, but I have a terrible habit of forgetting where I am and how I am. I do a lot of things that I don’t enjoy and then forget about it. Basically, I forget a lot of the things that I have done on my own. A Jane I’m very confident, but I also have a terrible habit of forgetting where I am and how I am. So in the end I just forget to look after myself. A Natalie I’ve always been very shy. It’s just not something I have naturally. As a kid, I was always really very shy, but now I feel a lot more confident. My job is very demanding, and I have to take on a lot more responsibility. And I forget where I am and how I am. A Rachel I’m very confident but, in my early 20s, it was something I struggled to learn how to do. When I was younger I had a hard time doing anything that wasn’t a chore. I thought I had to be good at everything and that made me fearful of failure. However, I was wrong. I was so scared to get out of bed in the morning. At the time, it’s really hard to get out of bed in the morning. I have had many experiences of being scared to go out and get out of bed. So, I have built up a lot of self-confidence through tackling and learning new skills. Q Jenny I’m very confident. I’m so proud of myself for being brave enough to speak up and not let people say nasty things to me. A Helen I’m very confident about everything I do. I have never felt less confident or more sure of myself. The fact that I have so much confidence shows how far I’ve come. A Stephanie I’ve always had a fear of public speaking, but that’s no longer true. I love public speaking, and I love being able to give it my all. I think confidence is such an amazing attribute. It’s like how confident a bird is, but you don’t have to be afraid of putting yourself out there. Q Jenny I never used to be confident about my skills, and it certainly didn’t come naturally, but as I grew up I got more confident, and attracted more and more opportunities. A Julie There are some things in life that","A confident person may look as though they were born that way, but most people tell me that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. A Jenny When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. Now, I do and I'm confident. A Hannah When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. Now, I do and I'm confident. A Hannah In school I was shy because I didn't like being in groups, but since leaving school I feel confident.

A Jenny Luckily I had a friend who was so confident that she could speak up for me in social situations. That was what taught me how to be confident and if you are feeling nervous, re-assure yourself that you don't have to be. The thing is you can be shy, and you can be shy and confident; if you make the right choices, you can improve a lot in a short space of time. A Kat I grew up being extremely shy, and I wasn't confident until I decided that I didn't want to be. There are ways to grow more confident, so if you're in this situation, don't give up, try something new and see what happens. A Chris I was really shy before leaving school. I never thought I'd end up like this, but I did end up expressing myself more in public. As a result, I wasn't as nervous when I went on stage in my first solo show, and I started to feel more comfortable in front of people. It wasn't until I started doing stage work that I really started to feel confident, and I started to make a lot more friends. A Joe I was so confident after I left school that I'd never thought I'd be able to make friends. Everyone told me that I looked like I wasn't confident in front of people, but I was actually quite shy before. When I started doing more stage work, I found that I became less nervous when it came to performing. So I think if I can do this, then anyone can. A Jenny In school, I was shy, but in the workplace, I've also learnt that people are more confident in their own skin. If you can take the time to get to know people, then you can begin to feel more confident and less worried about speaking to a stranger. A Joe I was very confident but I think people did not really like me when I started at work. My first job as a salesman taught me how to become more confident, and now I get to be more confident at work and outside of it. A Kat I was not confident at school and I still am. I'm still shy, but I have been able to break out of that. A Jenny I've always been good at speaking in front of groups and having my voice heard. Now I can talk to people I normally wouldn't have seen because I'm so confident. B Kat I used to feel very shy and I used to think I never would be able to speak in front of people. I thought it would be impossible, but I have been able to overcome that. When I get nervous I remember thinking: I will look nervous, but I don't have to worry about it.","It was very hard being shy at school but now I'm very confident because I've learned to do my best in everything. I learnt to talk to people, I learnt to talk about my mistakes and to make mistakes again, I also found out that everyone makes mistakes. I now understand why I felt shy and that was because I never knew how to deal with them. I learned to use my skills to make everyone happy. I also learnt how to manage my time. I learned to manage all of these things by learning to be more organised. I learnt to make decisions when I need to, and I managed to do this and stay on top of my work load. I also learnt how to set priorities and stick to them. I learned how to keep myself calm.","I used to be very shy, and I still am! But I think one of the things I changed – and I realised it in a really big way – is that I was quite afraid to talk to other people. Initially I was afraid to ask questions because I wasn’t sure what they were going to say. In high school, I started to ask questions so that I could discover what they thought of me. Now I don’t feel so scared anymore. B Lucy I was a very shy child and I think the reason I started speaking out more was because I had so many times tripped over myself. I used to do this when I was in primary school and that’s when I really started to learn self-control, that I’d go over and tripped over myself again and again so that I learned that I could stop myself. I’ve since used this skill to speak out and I’m so confident now. It doesn’t feel natural anymore. C Jacqui I was never confident as a child, and I didn’t think I had the skills. I think I was only confident as a child because I didn’t see how others could be confident. I’d look for someone who seemed confident and try to mimic them. That might sound like a cliché, but I believe that when you are confident, it reflects back to you in a positive way. D John What I’ve learned is that it was much easier for me to have a good relationship with someone who was confident, than it was for someone who was not confident at all.","When I was in primary school I was a very shy person. I'd never even been out of the house for a month before I sat for my first test at school. But when I finally got there, I found out that I'd scored high enough to take the exam and I was thrilled. I took the exam and I was absolutely terrified. But I started to get used to being nervous and it soon got easier for me to talk to people. Today, I'm more confident than I ever thought I'd be. And you can see it, too. B Mark I wasn't a very confident kid at school either. At school I was very quiet, and I just didn't open up to anyone. But when I got my first job in my early twenties, the first job I got, I was working at a supermarket. I was a bit shy, but there was a lady there who was very friendly and she introduced me to a very nice man who pushed me out of my comfort zone. It was this man who gave me my first confidence boost. I still don't know exactly how I made it from being a shy kid to being a confident one, but I think that's how I made it. C Liz I always felt very self-conscious when I was younger, and I'm sure it's the same for many other people. It was just something I'd never really managed to overcome. So it made me even more determined that I needed to step out of my comfort zone. D Graeme I wasn't the most confident kid in school, and in fact if I tried I could've got into even deeper trouble. But I was very determined and I'm really proud of myself for getting so far. I'm confident now and I know that I'm doing well in my job, because I have a lot of confidence in myself.","A Confident person may look as though they were born that way but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. A Jenny When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I found it hard to talk to people and I felt very alone.

B2,"In this year's Commonwealth Games, teenager Annika Reeder from Nottingham is looking forward to a moment that won't soon be forgotten: taking gold in gymnastics. Annika is just 15, but her life has already changed in a dramatic way. She's already smashed the 15-year-old world record in the gymnastics vault, which she said she wouldn't have thought was possible. ""I just looked up and was like what the heck? There's a person in the stands at the Commonwealth Games with an entire medal. You can go up there and be like wow, they are doing something really, really exciting with a huge gold medal in front of you,"" she recalled. ""And it was a massive deal for me. It was a moment I will cherish for the rest of my life. My mum, the gymnastics coach, had asked me to have a photo of Annika with the medal in the post to post in our room. I thought that would be a bit surreal, so I went and had a photo with Annika,"" says Annika's mother, Janet. Then she took another and took another. Then another. ""This is the day where I'll look back on the whole year and think about how everything got done."" Annika was given a gold medal and then, like every gymnastics champion, her mum – with a large beard – cried, beaming at her girl. When Annika's mum, Janet, told her that Annika was one of the world's best gymnasts, her response was: ""She's obviously very talented and you don't have to look far to see that she loves gymnastics,"" says Janet. ""Everyone knows about her. She has won at every level and has had a brilliant career. But she's also had a difficult childhood. For years she was ill and couldn't walk. ""Every single time she'd get to go to gymnastics, it was a constant worry about her and she would fall and break her leg."" Janet explained, ""It was a bit like the school playground. We were worried she would never get to gymnastics but we didn't worry. When she started we told her she could just do gymnastics for fun as that's what she was good at, but we thought it wouldn't get any better so she just had to train harder. ""But now, she's got a gold medal, and that just puts it right in the mix."" Janet was an Olympic gymnast herself, competing in the 1984 Summer Olympics, but never really thought she'd be on the podium in front of thousands of people. ""She was really worried about going to the Olympics. She told me that if she did she'd break her leg, or have to go to the hospital and have an operation for her leg. She's not a girl that feels intimidated by boys, although she did enjoy rubbing shoulders with and posing for him at the games. ""She was going to be a princess and have the attention of everyone that came to the games. But we didn't have the money to take her to the games. Her mum says she felt a lot of guilt."" Another mum, Janet says she was glad she never had to deal with the tears of seeing her daughter go off to the Olympics. ""I thought it was such a special moment for her – to see her go – but then it wasn't. It wasn't a good sign. It made me rethink everything, about what my daughter had sacrificed because it's not easy to put your faith in young people who are young and nave,"" she says. ""That's not easy for the parents either - it's such a big responsibility. It can also be a huge emotional roller-coaster ride because they're so proud of their children."" Janet still catches some sleep after waking in the middle of the night. ""It's a bit weird when you're awake, because you've been up all night, but there's nothing like that,"" she says. But the only real reward for a mother who worries about her daughter's future is when she collects her medal. ""Someone else's medal means a lot to me. I don't really worry about them - I just feel so proud that she did it. To be able to show that this is something I believe in,"" she says. ""I'm very grateful she did it. I've had so many people tell me it's something I","In a world of media-hyped heroes, children's sports stars like Annika Reeder 15, from England, are a rare breed. But while watching her perform at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, mother and daughter Sarah Reeder 19 and Hannah Reeder 14 were unsure whether to cry. Sarah's daughter, Annika, was one of eight girls on the Australian gymnastics team and was competing in the team events. When Annika saw her daughter receive her medal she was overcome with emotion. ""It was so moving. I've never felt like this before. I really did."" Sarah's daughter, Hannah, was one of eight girls on the Australian gymnastics team and was competing in the team events. When Annika saw her daughter receive her medal she was overcome with emotion. ""It was so moving.""

After winning two gold medals and a silver in the women's gymnastics team, she was invited to the Commonwealth Games. The family, who had visited the country two years earlier, were overwhelmed with excitement for Annika. ""The atmosphere of the games is very special,"" Sarah said. ""When you're watching your child perform, there are so many emotions. ""When they get a medal, it feels like a huge achievement."" Sarah's daughter, Hannah, 14 was one of eight girls on the Australian gymnastics team and was competing in the team events. ""It's really incredible, seeing them win that medal.

When it was over, I couldn't stop sobbing. It was a bit of a letdown, but then it was a lot of fun. There are so many highs, but I can't believe that this is how I became a mother. My son, James, won a bronze. You would never believe he was my son. But it's a lot easier to be a mother when you're a mum. I got a lot of advice from my dad... I have to be as supportive as I can. The advice came mostly from him and from my grandmother, so you never think that you'll hear those things from me! B. Ellie King, 18 and a world champion in football, won a bronze medal.

The boy I am now is 14 years old. I never even knew that. I'm not like that now, but when my son was born, I knew that I wanted him to have a good future, like the parents had. So I spent two years in care and didn't see him at all. I thought I was going crazy, and I couldn't believe it, I was shattered. But it was all good after that. I know how proud he is of me. I couldn't be prouder. He said he wanted me to see him again next year. When I walked into the room where he was sleeping, I saw a blurry photograph of him wearing the medal. I thought he was sleeping through it, but it was him. I saw the tears and I felt like I was going to cry too. I could barely breathe. I'm also going to remember forever what it was like, how they had rushed to get Annika out of the hotel, how they had taken all her things for her, how they had held Annika up all night and how they put her in the car for us. It was such a moment of pure joy and it will always be a special moment for me. After he died, my children got married, I became a mum and it's just been so good. I'm just so lucky. B. Anna McLean and Emily McLean, both 16, were British gymnastics stars at the Commonwealth Games.

There are many things Charlie admires about this bird: it’s ability to fly fast and stab its prey in the air before it flies away. He’s especially interested in how they keep fit, the way they move their wings to catch the fish they catch and how long they stay on the water, how they bob in the air and the movements they make when they fly back to shore. He’s also interested in how they hold their breath. He’d like to take a photograph of a kingfisher. After looking at all the photographs he’d taken, he asked one of his friends to accompany him and take pictures for him. When Charlie showed up, he asked his friend for help.

B2,"Cosmo Landesman, an Australian writer, was invited to be in one of television's most secretive locations to observe the audience that makes up many of the country's top programmes, including Game of Thrones, The Master of None, The Big Bang Theory, One Night in Paris and What's My Line? Cosmo was one of only three people invited to be in the audience for a BBC Television pilot called Top Gear. Like most of you, I've never seen one myself, but what the hell - I thought this would be an interesting and fun experience. With our briefing over, I jumped into a room with some snazzy looking headsets, and walked towards the back where the cameras were. There were three of us who got into our chairs and waited. I took them into the studio and sat at the back of the room. I'm not sure how I got in but the man at the door who checked me in told me to sit close to the side of the studio, as he doesn't want to see me. He told me I was the oldest man in the room, he said, but he also said he was the only older man in the room. I knew he was trying to show me something but I was too engrossed in making eye contact to even look at him. The camera crew had already started preparing their shot when I arrived so I couldn't see what they were aiming at. I couldn't see anything, but I did hear some clapping in the background as the crew started to rig and film the scene. Cosmo's father told me that he was sitting at a table near one of the doorways, watching as the camera crew set up the shot, in a different studio, but there I was: standing in the corner, waiting. I could hear the buzzing of other cameras nearby, but I couldn't make out anything. So I took my seat and waited. It was pretty hot, in the middle of the room, and about 20 minutes later, my seat was filled. The cameras, microphones and other gear poured out from behind the throng of audience members, and I could feel the tension swell from behind me. I was on camera. That's not to say I couldn't be a bit nervous, there was some nervousness to my excitement. I'd brought two drinks - one with me and one without. I also had a snack of chips, which was a real plus for me - and the atmosphere around me was amazing. I was so engrossed in watching the programme that I didn't realize I was in an audience until I started filming. When my friends spotted me filming, they assumed I was in the audience - and they came over to ask about it. The camera crew paused, showed them the audience, and then filmed me again. I'd drank lots of water in the days before and the day after. I even remember that I ate a lot of chicken nuggets before filming the scene! I didn't even know that the cameras were recording me in the audience - it was all that strange noise coming from my seat. After filming, I went and sat in a nearby hotel room. The only other members of the audience were me, my friends, and my mum. My mum and I were just chilling together and enjoying the space - but that was enough for me to do it. For my final question, I asked my father to explain how he knew which way I had to turn in order to make it to the next shot. He said I could see and hear everything when I opened the door. He didn't say much, but he did say that the cameras could actually see me, so he could see me from the other side. He said it was amazing that he was in the audience, but there was a lot more to the audience than just those two people. He said the audience were like the crew. They didn't have to look at me to know which way I was going. They didn't have to understand why I had to turn around in order to see the other side. I thought the audience would be like the crew. And they weren't; they didn't care how I did it. They did care about the people in the room. It was fun to be a part of this.",Cosmo Landesman wanted to see if he could become part of one of the many different studio audiences. After some careful research he discovered that there are three important things that every audience member should know about what goes on on TV. Cosmo is amazed to find out that studio audiences are mainly made up of people who enjoy watching TV and that they don't care what the hosts are saying. To this day the audience he saw on television is completely uninterested in watching the host. Even the host seemed to have no idea what the audience is doing there. It seemed strange that one of his favorite topics was the show's title. Cosmo felt a certain sense of responsibility in knowing that the name of the programme was the same as the title of the show. It might also be important to understand why audiences do not like having their picture taken with the TV host. Cosmo will never understand why the audience - as he does not own it - does not think that the show is as important as the hosts themselves.,"Cosmo Landesman is a student at University College London, where he was studying Media Studies. At the moment he is in the first year of a course on television production. A few years ago he had a chance to be in a television studio audience and, along with a few other students, he had to watch a programme being made and report back. Cosmo wrote this article for a newspaper called the Evening Standard.","Cosmo Landesman grew up watching television on the small screen, but he never thought he would become a part of it. Cosmo has been writing about television for eight years, and while studying drama at university he worked in a newsroom for three years, writing about everything from breaking news to the politics of the day. Cosmo is now an experienced and witty TV writer, and has published several books about TV shows, including How to Be a Boy Who Saved the World.","Cosmo Landesman (born 1981) is a journalist and TV producer from New York. He's a member of the British Council's Media Programme, and writes for The New York Times and Cosmopolitan. As well as his work on the television industry, Cosmo is also the founder and director of the International Film and Television Arts Festival, a non-profit arts organisation which organizes world-class festivals for documentary filmmakers, actors and journalists across Europe. He is interested in the human and social factors which affect the people in and around the studio.","Cosmo Landesman was curious to know what it is like to be in a television studio audience. Like technical difficulties, studio audiences are just another common feature of television life, and yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows for example, we sit back and ask ourselves, just who are these people? Cosmo Landesman went to a studio audience for an hour, and found out. He was a regular viewer of TV. What he found out was: They seemed to be in much greater demand in the UK than the rest of the world. They seemed more interested in the topic of the programme they were watching than the stars and the programme itself. They seemed to be mostly male (as opposed to the British public's more often mixed-race brethren), and they were slightly older. Cosmo didn't see anyone from any particular socio-economic background - that would have meant they had to be middle-class or middle-aged.","Cosmo Landesman was invited to be in a studio audience and he got a very different view. Not only did the audience get a close up view of the work being done behind the camera, but they also got to hear the stories behind the scenes of TV programmes as the action unfolded. In this episode of Cosmo's blog, Landesman explores some of the interesting situations and people that people in a studio audience have to deal with."

Chris nodded his head in agreement. ‘Ah,' the teacher said, ‘but he’s only fourteen and not big enough to be a flagpole.’","Chris walked to school alone one day, and saw that his friends were starting to get bigger and bigger.

'Yes,’ said Chris. ‘But the flagpole gets a lot of attention.'","One day, Chris woke up in bed. He realised that he had been awake all night and had stayed awake for three days. Then he saw something he could not believe. 'What is it,' he said with amazement. 'It’s a broom!' The broom was a four metre tall broom. It was made to sweep up leaves and leaves were not allowed on the streets.

B2,An infamous picture of the massacre is in The Haunting of Hill House in Arya Samaj.,"To this day, despite many attempts to reconcile with the British, the people of Amritsar have never forgiven the British.","The British troops of the British Raj decided to put down a peaceful demonstration in Amritsar, one of the city's largest. People gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi. The British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd.

As well as thousands of injuries there were hundreds of deaths.,"There was also an interesting episode that occurred in the fall of 1919. A man named Ram, who had been a slave for many years at the time of the Amritsar massacre, returned to his family farm in Punjab. He told them that he was a slave and had buried his wife and daughter in a safe house. When Ram died, there were three kids who had been living in his family home. One of the kids had died and he had a wife and a daughter. The family had been living together and Ram was worried about them. Then there was a man named Ranjeet who had become a Muslim and had also become a slave at the same time. As Ram was leaving the area to visit his wife and daughter, his friend Sikhs gathered in the park. A British general was there and he ordered them to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As many people as they could, he killed. The British commander was a ruthless commander and he sent his soldiers to put down a peaceful protest, so as not to upset the king of the day. Instead, the British soldiers killed his followers in cold blood. Although the British did not release all the people who died, most of the victims were British troops.","The British rulers in India decided to put down protests in the city of Amritsar.

B2,"The En-V is GM's clever two-wheeled two-seat solution to urban transport. It's a bit like flying a small plane. After watching it move around in the wind, I realized it wasn't so much a car at all. The EN-V was designed for urban living, but the two-wheeled concept would probably work as the answer to all the problem cities are facing when it comes to urban transport. The idea behind the two-wheeled concept was to move people in a way that would minimise the need for infrastructure and parking. The EN-V has a single wheel at its centre, but can be converted into two (though the two wheels will have to be identical) to offer a more comfortable ride for the passengers. In a world where a city has enough space for 500,000 cars to serve the growing population, these two-wheeled vehicles could be a real asset to the city. The concept also features an all-aluminium chassis, and weighs no more than a tiny car would. GM claims an EN-V can reach 50 mph in 10 seconds. But that's not all: it does so on four wheels only and can also take passengers at a speed of around 30mph, thanks to a unique aerodynamic shape. Basically, the EN-V isn't much like a car at all, and even if it was it would probably not be safe for long-distance journeys. It might also not be advisable for driving on the highway. What happens when you fly a plane? We didn't see the two-wheeled concept on the roads. But we did try to track down the En-V, which was launched last year at the Chicago Auto Show. The two-wheeled concept could be GM's answer to the big traffic problem. So why is it such a unique thing? The EN-V's aerodynamic shape is inspired by the wings of an aeroplane, and the vehicle doesn't actually have a steering wheel. Instead, the control is provided by a central panel at the front, where the engine's power is routed through. The two-wheeled concept would look quite different if there were a steering wheel. But the front-facing motor is a two-cylinder petrol engine, while the rear-facing one is a more conventional combustion engine that the engine would use for its final drive. GM believes that this shape can save weight and improve fuel economy in the EV market, and the bodystyle would be very similar to a car's. The idea is that the bodywork could be folded down when not in use to save space. The EN-V's body is made from the same materials as the cars the company is planning to sell. But the GM engineers haven't yet made a decision about whether it will become a production vehicle. The EN-V won't be available until the beginning of 2018. The ride-on electric two-wheeled vehicle would need to be able to accelerate to 100km/h in just five seconds and be capable of a top speed of 80km/h in just four seconds. GM says its EN-V will be ""easily adaptable to a range of ride-on electric vehicle applications."" We did not get much of a chance to try it out on the road, but you can read our full coverage here.","GM has a clever two-wheeled two-seater solution for urban transport. The new concept car is less like a scooter and more like a plane. The American automaker’s concept vehicle has a seat for two passengers, a luggage rack and a steering wheel on one side and a seat on the other for two people. The concept was displayed on Monday at the Geneva Motor Show. GM hasn't announced pricing, nor an estimated production date. But that hasn't stopped the car from generating plenty of interest. Last week, Telegraph Motoring’s Mike Rutherford had the chance to try it for a spin. “It was quite bizarre, it was like driving a small plane,” Rutherford says. ""It's not a car – it's a little like a hovercraft."" As it turns out, Rutherford isn't the first to describe the ride as bizarre. The EV version of the Tesla Model 3 is also shaped more like a plane, albeit with the wings removed and a smaller engine. It’s been designed for use on highways. But the company says that it isn’t really a plane, it is a car. A single motor provides power to the front wheel, while the back wheels travel at about 90km per hour. This is a big advantage in city environments, which would otherwise require a lot of vehicle to handle. It’s worth remembering that the car is designed to handle rough road surfaces. ""These are not cars that are designed for normal road conditions,"" Rutherford said. ""And in the same way that an electric car isn't really designed to be driven through town or on the highway because it needs to have some level of stability if it's going to handle rough roads in those conditions."" It’s still a little like flying a small plane, but the fact the car is made of aluminium and steel and has a little suspension system makes it so that the car is far more stable when accelerating and cornering than a traditional vehicle would be. ""The steering is a little bit of a problem too, because the gear selector is not fully controlled. But the car handles just fine, so it's a pleasure to drive."" Rutherford went on to explain that while it's a fun and easy experience, driving it felt like you were just playing with a toy, and there wasn't a lot of traction with the wheels or brakes. While it's certainly lighter than a scooter, it doesn't have the torque of a car, and is therefore more suited for short journeys. The EN-V is likely to be produced in limited numbers and is not expected to be on sale in the UK anytime soon. But it is a far cry from the current scooter, which is also only suitable for short journeys because it uses a bicycle-sized hub motor. The new EV concept is a big step away from GM’s previous work on two-wheelers – the first was the EV-1, which went off the production line in 2003 – and is probably more suited to handling and city driving – but its use of two wheels means it is still pretty small for a car. The EV-1 was a smaller, slower car, with two wheels attached to each wheel. This gave the EV-1 a smaller weight of about 450kg, a lot lighter than the current model but still heavier than a normal car. Its cabin is also far smaller than anything you would expect from a car.","Two-wheeled two-seater concept: GM unveils it first at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. Mike Rutherford takes one for a spin. GM’s clever EN-V concept car is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport. A video demonstrates this futuristic concept and it is not for the faint-hearted. In an exclusive report for Telegraph Motoring, Mike Rutherford takes one for a spin.","The world’s first two-wheeled car is the latest concept by General Motors. The company calls it the “EN-V” and the concept car has an all-electric drivetrain. In a recent interview with the Telegraph, the company’s senior product manager, Peter Gaffney, told the paper how GM incorporated two-wheeled tech into its all-electric vehicle, which would be able to go up to 30mph. “It has a lot of benefits, it allows people to ride around in different locations and has a lot of interesting opportunities for the future of mobility,” says Gaffney. The vehicle is due to hit production next year in China, but Gaffney said it is “not practical for most people” and would probably have to be used on the open road in China. The EN-V, named after the Energetic Network of Vehicles, is being tested by engineers at GM’s research facility in Detroit. It has a front wheel drive and rear wheel drive and has three different operating modes. The first, which the company said works a lot like an “extreme modem,” runs the vehicle in reverse. “It has two axels which are connected to a gearbox and a gear stick and is the only one that can rotate as the car is in motion, and it is designed to spin for two or three seconds before coming to a complete stop,” he told The Telegraph. The EV can go 60mph in under a second, though it can’t achieve as much as some other electric vehicles, such as Tesla’s Model S. The GM EN-V was a prototype car at last month’s Detroit Auto Show. It has now moved from the concept car stage to production.","GM has conceived a neat two-wheeled two-seater concept for a future where many people have to use cars less and less. Last week, Mike Rutherford took it for a spin in a prototype. The futuristic concept uses a single drive shaft and two bicycle-style wheels to pull a tiny electric motor to power a small propeller-driven electric motor at high speeds – a la the little EV pictured above. There are two speeds at which the bike is able to cruise at around 20 mph, and two at which it can reach speeds of around 15 mph. The speed of the motor is selected by tilting the rear wheel which is able to move a handlebar mounted gyroscope (the equivalent of a compass). The engine is located inside the car, on the right hand side of the vehicle. This is a fairly innocuous concept. The main motor is paired to a gearbox inside the gyroscope to which the bike is attached. It is, I suppose, the way that most cars would be made today, if you had a car that went 0-60 in a couple of seconds and were able to reverse. Instead, it is a bit of a joke car, and something I would see on the roads of the future – rather like the bicycle-style EV above. The bike itself has been designed around the concept of low emissions. All of the vehicle’s fuel is produced on its own system – and that is the engine and gearbox. This gives the bike a nice, low cost, low maintenance option. The bike itself has been designed to be easy to drive on a single axle, and it has an electric motor mounted underneath the handlebar which powers the rear axle. The whole thing was tested on the Isle of Man at the start of the week, and that included navigating the narrow streets in the snowy Scottish Highlands. This was a genuinely enjoyable experience, and I am glad I got to experience it. The whole thing is really well designed and built, and is in some ways a completely different beast to a car, even though the motor and gearbox are quite similar. The only thing that changes is the bike has to be attached to a fixed yoke, which can be locked in order to make it feel like a car. I had plenty of fun on my brief drive and am confident we will see more of them being used in cities. What was your first impression of the EN-V? Mike Rutherford had the chance to test drive one on Monday as part of the Telegraph Motoring’s preview of the car, and is quite taken with it. It has a great range and speed, but the thing that is most impressive about it is the sheer amount of power that you have to push. I’d be pretty happy to drive a 125bhp Honda CBR1000RR if it would have some decent mpg. If you thought driving on two wheels was dangerous, you’re wrong. You might be more used to motorbikes than quad bikes, but the power of this thing will blow your mind. There are also some practical issues, such as charging and battery life, as you will need some sort of charger.","The futuristic GM En-V concept is a two-wheeled, two-seater solution to urban transport. The small car was developed in partnership with Volvo Cars as part of a project to explore the use of electric mobility as a sustainable, environmentally friendly means of transport. It is still in development and a production version has not yet been produced. It is able to drive forward, backward and sideways but has no wheel steering. This means it is not practical to drive through the city on a road with no left turn lane or to overtake on a single lane with narrow lanes. This is because the wheels don't want to turn. You would need to keep your head up to see them turning in the direction they are turning. The EN-V looks a lot like a small bike or skateboard – if it is designed correctly. GM have said it is designed to ""provide a safe and accessible way of traveling around our cities."" It is still under development. The GM EN-V concept looks like a small bike or skateboard and is in concept form. It has a two-wheel drive and is a two-seater that is similar to a bicycle but is made from a styrofoam-like material and a carbon-fibre skeleton. There is no seat for the driver and passenger.",This GM concept looks like it will offer a better idea for two-wheeled commuting.
B2,"An unforgettable train journey took me to the Scottish Highlands one summer. I took a local train from Glasgow to the small village of Milngavie in the north and fell in love with the countryside and the people. It was a cold, grey day but the smell of the forest wafted along the train as we passed through some dramatic scenery. As my car neared Milngavie, a farmer stopped to give me a drink and I sat in the back of the car for a while in silence before deciding to ask him for a ride. I was nervous but we had a really good time and I've been back three more times since. I was a very young child and the train journey I took from London to Edinburgh was one of the first I remember. My dad is a railway enthusiast and always takes us in the countryside. We go through a tunnel and it opens up to the sky and is stunning. The Alps at sunrise is always very special, just like standing on a glacier looking down on a glistening sea. My favourite part of any train journey is standing by the door waiting for the train to pass! Delia Derbyshire - BBC presenter I remember the day when I was 17 and my dad took me on a train to London by himself. We got off at Gatwick and he said, “This is the most amazing place, we’re going to visit it next year”. We arrived in Gatwick on a Thursday morning and he showed me where to find my hotel and then showed me around the station. I've always been fascinated by trains ever since. It was a very cold day and the train was frozen and had two empty carriages. I sat on the front of the train in awe and realised I was standing in the front seat. He said, “That is the most beautiful train I have ever seen. You can go all the way from London to the Arctic circle and still not see any ice!” I wasn't sure if he was serious but he knew I had to be honest! Delia Derbyshire - English singer I always go on trains from Birmingham to Manchester. It’s a great way to get back in time for the Christmas season. You can go from Birmingham to Manchester, Birmingham to Liverpool, Liverpool to Cardiff and then Cardiff to Edinburgh. It takes about a hour to get to Manchester and the train journey is a total rush. I've never been on a plane, but I've flown a number of times. The best part is I get to go to the Great Western Railway Museum – it’s a fantastic museum – and on one of the days we were at the museum we were given a tour of the museum which you can actually actually get to. I also once visited London to meet my great grandmother for the first time. I remember taking the train to Scotland and then going home on it for the first time as a child. I was so excited but I had no idea there was so much to see along the way. Delia Derbyshire - BBC presenter I was four and I remember the railway – I was terrified of heights and I was scared of heights, but I loved the train – and I loved the sound of it! I remember going on my first railway journey, but my dad's dad had a train accident and so my brother was left with me instead. He went to hospital but was luckily ok so he never had to face a rail accident. I always like it when I meet someone new who shares my interest in trains. C Catherine Zeta Jones - journalist","This is a great list, but my favourite memory is a railway journey from Paris to London back in 1975. It was so lovely sitting in the carriage with my brother and I looking out of the window in the sunshine at the beautiful landscape we were passing and the train whistle that we could almost see the Eiffel Tower. I never got back to the UK. The London Underground was a bit too crowded and uncomfortable, so I went the bus – now the tube is my new favourite thing to do, and I can't wait to go again. B Matthew Bourne - Actor This railway journey I remember the most was from the UK to Berlin. We were travelling from Amsterdam to London, and there were so many people around the station and it was just amazing. It just felt like such a magical time. C Jennifer Lopez - Actress I'm quite addicted to train travel and I love to go on long journeys with my boyfriend and travel around Europe. I love to catch a train to Ireland, or a train to New York. I love travelling with friends. For my last birthday we went to Italy, and I had a train ride through the country with my friend Tom Daley. We were travelling for about 10 hours in one day, but we managed to take two trains along the way. The whole trip was so amazing. D Amanda Byrne - Actress My favourite train journey is definitely going to be the time I took from New York to Budapest and back. It was a really special time. I had never been on a train before, it was very surreal.","Andrea Thompson, who is a BBC newsreader, likes to travel back to Cannes by local train, as she enjoys the scenery, people and the atmosphere. She likes to take a long train journey too, so she took the one from Cannes to Nice last year. And on my first day there I took a train from Nice to Cannes, and took a taxi back. It was a really fantastic day out, and I’d recommend it to anyone. Andrew Morgan, BBC presenter, is the author of several books including The Last Supper, the bestseller A Year in the Country, and the book The Year in The City. He is an expert on rail travel and is a regular speaker on BBC programmes and radio.","I love travelling by train because it’s so easy to get to places. I go to the Netherlands all the time and when I travel by train it’s always a delight to get to different destinations. I love going by coach in the UK too. A few of my favourite experiences have been going out with my friends and family and driving around in my family’s vintage car. I love travelling by train in France because I always get a sense of adventure. A particularly enjoyable memory was the trip to Belgium from London on the Eurostar. It was amazing, especially because there were snow plows along the road, and it would be a good sight to see a plow coming along the road. I’m a big train fan and that trip is one of my all-time favourites. B Emma Watson - actress I love trains and especially the Eurostar service from London to Paris. Getting to Paris is a big deal for me, so travelling by train is a real treat. C Zoe Ball - model I have such a special love for trains as they are a big part of my life. I love taking train journeys to get a sense of place. I love travelling to Berlin and then getting off the train to walk around. The food is also a major part of the experience, and I love to get off and walk along the river. It was always such a nice feeling. D David Walliams - comedian I used to spend a lot of time travelling around Europe as a kid. I fell in love with this amazing city when I was a kid. I also loved trains so much I got a job as a platform hand at a station. I got to London Victoria and then got off in London Bridge. I loved travelling through London, especially along the canals. There’s always something new to see. Ewan McGregor - actor I really love travelling by train, there’s just something very peaceful and tranquil about it. A beautiful view of London. D David Walliams - actor I remember travelling through Yorkshire by train as a child. It’s a nice, relaxing experience. Pixie Lott - singer I have a special love for trains, and my most memorable journey was when I was a kid. I was lucky enough to travel on the London Eye when it was a special trip, and I loved travelling with the driver on a London Eye train. It was magical. Ewan McGregor is the son of John McGregor and Isabella McGregor. I remember the journey he made on a railway to the top of Ben Nevis in Scotland. Obviously he didn’t get there, but the train was so fun! D David Walliams - actor I was lucky enough to spend a few days travelling around India. I fell in love with the country and I think it’s really important to travel somewhere you love. I loved London and London is a beautiful place. Nadia Ali - radio presenter I fell in love with the Alps, the scenery and the trains. There are lots of wonderful railways in the UK and there’s loads to do and see. A very special memory was a train ride up to Mont Blanc that we took together on my first visit to the UK. A friend is an engineer and I got to experience it all – from the trains to the mountains, from the city to the countryside.","A celebrity was on a railway, where did you want to go? Andrea Thompson - Newsreader Andrea Thompson is a newsreader for ITV News who has spent most of her career on the radio. Andrea says: ""I loved going on the trains when I was younger and got very excited about going places for work and I always remember them. I would love to go on an adventure and get lost in a place. This was probably when I first started a career on Radio 4. I would like to go somewhere new. I would love to travel to Africa to see all the amazing wildlife. I would love to visit China. I would love to explore the United States. I would love to travel across the globe. ""A lioness on a train,"" says Andrea. ""I got so excited when a train surrounded me and I wanted to jump off and have a play or a ruckus. ""The lioness on a train is really interesting, I haven't been on the train before so I'm not sure I would enjoy it. ""There is a train in the South of France which is beautiful and the scenery on that train makes me think of being on the other side of the ocean."" Andrea also shares her favourite memories on the train. ""When we went to England we got on the train and I remember sitting in the carriage. It was like I was on a magic carpet,"" she said. ""It just felt like we were on another world."" Andrea says: ""The scenery on this train is amazing, everything is green. ""I love getting lost and I had just got off the train at a stop that was very busy and I wasn't used to how busy it was. You could get lost in the countryside for hours. ""A lioness on a train is really interesting, I haven't been on the train before so I don't know whether I would like it or not. ""As a kid, I was obsessed with trains, and when I was younger, I used to go to a lot of parties and get carried away and I love it. I would get lost all the time on the trains and I loved the fact that there was always a party going on.""","I really love train travel. It gives me a sense of a sense of escape. I have some of my most amazing memories of travelling by train. The London Underground is one of my favourite transport experiences. In fact, it’s something I never want to stop doing. My favourite place to travel on the underground is London. You can go anywhere – you just have to get on a train to go there.","The actress Emma Watson, who has recently moved to London from the south of France, has had a particular love affair with train travel. She says: I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to get back there as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy."
B2,"At the end of this week I’ll be back in the U.S. so I have some time to explore New York City by myself. I had no idea about this place until I started writing about it in the past year. I wanted to do an interesting and thought provoking book so I took a chance and wrote about it. I’m a big New Yorker with a very big heart and a deep love for its history and culture. I’m not afraid to ask questions, and when it comes to exploring the city, I always look for the bigger picture. I figured that I would share with you some photos and details of a city that I was fortunate enough to experience first hand. The book is called The World Without Us and is about the last human beings who lived on the planet. If you enjoyed this story then please click on the follow button or on the image below to go to my Instagram page.",A story about the city that will not exist without humans. A story about what it would be like if humans were to disappear.,"The answer is that, in about 4.5 billion years, there will be no us. It sounds like a distant hope, but the reality is that without us, our planet would cease to exist within about 5.5 billion years. At that point, the natural world would have adapted itself to a more basic state. The planet would still exist, but perhaps, not quite the way we know it. It would look different. The book starts with the question: How long would it take for the earth to revert to a simpler state? As a geologist, Alan Weisman examined past Earth’s past to predict the fate of the earth 100 million years in the future. The author’s thesis was that if we were to suddenly disappear, our planet would quickly start changing for the worse. To start with, Weisman had found, the Earth would suffer a massive mass extinction event that would destroy all of life on the planet. In the beginning, there would be a few millions of people. As the world cooled, it would become more hostile and aggressive. In the second century, the Earth would probably be a desert. Then, in the fourth, the Earth would be a swamp. And in the fifth, and finally, in the sixth century, it would be submerged in a bog. In the sixth century, we would have to survive. At that point, we would probably have to survive on less water. Finally, in the sixth century, we would have to survive on the planet that we currently live on. Alan Weisman was born in New York in 1950. He graduated from Columbia University with a degree in biology in 1976, and studied for two more years in China. During his second year, he won a Fulbright fellowship to study at the University of California, Berkeley. In his free time, Alan enjoys doing all sorts of different things. He is a big fan of jazz, and is currently reading a novel called The Man in the High Castle by Jonathan Swift.","It's been a few years since the world was last explored. The last time our planet's climate was as extreme as it is today has been about 35,000 years ago. There was a short time period when the sun was very hot and the planet was warm enough to support life, but then a time when the sun was very cold. The result of this is that the earth's climate would be inhospitable to life and animals. The story in this story is the analysis of what New York City would look like if there were no humans to take care of it.","This is a summary of chapter 12: “The World Without Us” by Alan Weisman, a New York Times bestselling author, who has questioned whether humanity’s mark on Earth will disappear if we stop making contributions to it. Chapter 12 provides an overview of what life would do in different parts of the world. The reader can read further about these different places (for example, Chapter 13 explains how the ice sheet of Antarctica might change). In the meantime, it’s good to know that, at some point, humankind’s mark on Earth will disappear if we stop making contributions to it. The Earth was once full of dinosaurs, but after the last dinosaur died, the Earth was ejected from the Solar System. In the resulting ice age, the Earth’s surface cooled very slowly (every 20–25 years) until the land froze permanently. This is known as the Anthropocene, and human activities have made the planet more uninhabitable. But thanks to our industrialisation and climate change, we may soon be able to return to our former state. Weisman’s chapter describes how New York would cope without humans. He compares the city’s conditions to those of Earth in the Jurassic period when the dinosaurs were first discovered. He also examines how the city would become the perfect environment for a new species of humanoid, the superhuman, that can perform many of the same functions as humans. A superhuman would be able to do things that normal humans can’t: build a palace and a city on a huge scale; feed its own people with nutritious food; develop and use artificial intelligence; and build artificial intelligence. This would be the superhuman, and it might be able to create artificial intelligence — just like humans do now. What are the chances of humans creating these new species and achieving the perfect environment? Well, the most likely scenario involves a climate change caused by an extinct volcano or asteroid. In the worst case, there would be a mass extinction of all life on Earth. In the best case, the Earth may take many millions of years to adapt to the new conditions. In the worst case, humans could still exist and could be helpful to other species — maybe even a reincarnation that would make more intelligent than humans. For example, the chimps could become more intelligent than humans and build their own worlds on Earth. But in the worst case, the chimps are unlikely to be able to help the other humans to adapt to an un-inhabited world. In the worse case, the chimps might be more useful for humans than for humans. For example, they would help the humans to overcome challenges such as climate change, because chimps have better cognitive abilities than humans and the monkeys will be more helpful to humans.","A couple of weeks ago, we were all woken up early by a strange noise. The first thing we thought was that it was a car approaching us. However, in fact it was a loud banging that sounded like a truck breaking down on a busy road. We had to look up the exact location of where the truck had just come from to see if it was actually moving.","What would happen to our planet if humans suddenly disappeared? This is the basic hypothesis behind Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us. Weisman examines how long it would take for humankind's mark on Earth to disappear.

B2,"A storm swept through the valley shortly after a late lunch. The lightning and thunder was frequent in the valley and the winds made the valley extremely dangerous to travel in. We all went to the mountaintop after dinner to watch the storm pass to avoid further damage. On the way up we had seen three children playing in a nearby field. One child even ran away from the storm with his arm ajar, and before we could do anything more they were all killed by lightning, not escaping in time to rescue him. It was a miracle that they managed to hide from us. We thought it was only a coincidence when our family and friends began to talk about leaving the valley. We felt like we were going nowhere. We had been out looking for a new home, but realised our valley was not the place for our children. As soon as we realised this, we had to act. We had to find an alternative, the most appropriate solution for our family. We waited for a storm to hit and went to our place. We had one hour and fifteen minutes before the storm hit us. We needed to run and hide in a storm shelter to prepare ourselves for what was to come. Once in the shelter, we took two blankets, one large and one small, one long and one short, with a small one tucked in the back. Once the storm came to pass, we took a ladder and climbed up the side of the mountain and started walking up the hill in order to reach the tree where we could climb up and climb down to the forest. We climbed the tree and climbed down the hill towards the forest. After a few minutes of running and hiding, we climbed down the hill through the forest on our way. We climbed down the mountain and came back to where the shelter was. We were tired and hungry after several days of walking, but we were able to run until we were tired. We rested for a little bit before we started looking for shelter to hide in. This was our first night where we were all asleep. We went to bed that night with a feeling that this new adventure would last forever. For days we waited for our second day in the woods. The villagers threw in more wood to help us climb the hill up again. I hoped they would be right and we could return to the valley. But we were wrong. After a few more days we returned to our new home. The storm had passed. As the sun rose we made our way to the top of the mountain. It was a cold day, and the sky was almost white. We could see the storm from the top of the hill. As soon as it had passed, the sun soared in all directions for a few hours. When we reached the top of the hill, the lightning struck a few more times, we were able to climb the hill on our way down. We kept up the pace of climbing until we were able to find shelter behind the ridge in the trees that surrounded the house. Finally we reached the top. I saw the red sun on the horizon and decided that since the weather had been so cold, we should go out into the fields. It was already starting to rain, so I chose to take the chance and go out to our small pond. I watched as the water slowly trickled down the cliff face and into our pond. It was a chilly afternoon, and I was glad that I had brought the heater.","We were in a valley that was very peaceful. But when I was a little girl my mother was pregnant with her first baby. She was very concerned with her little sister being at risk and that is why she drew the plans for our safe enclosure. This was a new idea, and so she did not want me to tell my mother about it, but instead made it a secret. The plan was to keep the children indoors, to keep the mother from having to worry about what would happen if the child was alone. I did not think it would be a good idea to tell her in such a way, but when she heard that idea she was extremely happy. The idea that there would be a safe place for the baby did not change her mind about protecting us from any danger. This was the day she thought of it. The storm was going to be bad and the cold weather would really test us. The mother was planning to go outside to play when she was going to be awakened, but the storm would ruin that plan. We ran back and told her to go outside. She would soon follow. My mother started looking at the map. She saw that the valley had been forested and that it was filled with huge trees that could easily fall over. The storm would be bad, but not as bad as before because of the large trees that could easily be brought down. Her mind was blown, as she saw the beautiful tall trees that would soon be falling in the valley. The wind whipped the branches, and she saw that the branches could be blown around, over and over again, but could not break. She saw the trees crashing down, the storm raged and the trees fell. She saw the mountain of green trees and how they were covered in snow. The storm raged again, but this time more powerful, and we couldn’t even see the trees. We couldn’t see the black rocks either. With my mother hysterical she yelled, ‘Leave it alone’ and ran outside. After a few moments of madness she ran up to her and yelled at me, ‘Do you see the branches that are falling?’ My mother screamed and saw the branches falling. The forest had been inundated with trees. She reached into her purse and jumped out. But, she caught the branches before she could pull her away from the tree, and saw that the branches were still trembling violently. She then saw two black rocks that were still hanging over the forest from the tree where her mother had climbed. In that moment she saw that the rock was a snake. Its tail had caught the branch, and she thought to herself, ‘This is the first time I have seen a snake in my life’. My mother had never seen a snake before, but that was enough for her to be scared. She looked at the branches again and saw a large spider clinging to the moss, and then she said, ‘Did you see the spider that was clinging to the moss and then the next day?’ My mother was frightened, and began screaming, and she went on screaming. My mother ran outside, but she found the snake was already dead. When she could see it the snake twisted around and circled around her neck until it had eaten her alive. She tried to escape but finally gave in and went on screaming. My mother ran up the hill towards the mountain to get the fire going. She heard it cracking, and saw the mountain roaring down. Her eyes got wide. She ran to her friend and the family dog. She saw her family dog looking for her and thought for a moment before telling the mother. I just thought my mother needed to hear it. The moss had grown over the mountain before they could reach us. The mountain was only about two miles away. Almost immediately we ran out of our little village. I don’t think my mother was as scared as she thought she was, though. That night we talked to my sister and told her to go back to the village. She told me she was happy there were no dangers there, but that they had to come and see if they could help. When she went to the nearby village they found a crow running around. We were lucky that she didn’t know it was an owl. This had happened a couple of years before, when we were preparing to",If only we could stop the weather.,"Our valley was small, but because of the mountains all around us, we had complete coverage. This meant that if the wind or rain started to come, our shelter was protected from these threats. However, this was not the only threat we were exposed to. A few months later, on a bright sunny day, the wind suddenly blew up from the mountains. It was powerful, but its strength was swift and we were able to escape easily. We were able to reach the top of the hill in only a matter of minutes. We stood there in awe as we saw the clouds roll slowly away from our valley. Soon, the heavy rains stopped, and with our house sheltered by the walls of our wooden cottage, our family set off to explore the hills in search of shelter. Our first stop was the top of the hill. When the wind reached us, the trees clattered around us roaring. As we stood there in anticipation, imagining how far we would have to climb, our hearts began to race. I remember that time I found myself pounding my chest hard. I looked at my father and I saw that he was on the ground. I couldn’t believe my eyes as the light touched my father’s face. I had never seen anything like that before. I was blown away by a strong gust of wind and we swung into action. I ran back towards my home. We had no choice but to hide in the dark. There were no trees to hide under so we moved in and set up our shelter. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine how many people would have fled the mountains in a matter of seconds. I can still see the cliffs of rock on my head. The sky looked like a million stars, yet when we stepped back, we could only see the bottom of the mountain. We couldn’t believe our luck when we saw a bright light as we rushed into the storm to save ourselves. The light that we spotted was so bright, so bright that my brother and I couldn’t tell if it was a person or an animal. We were standing there watching as the light came closer and closer, until it caught our breath and seemed to grow hot and then, like light from a candle, it dimmed to a glimmer of the dark, the moon, and the stars. Then, without a word, I ran into the tree and spotted it standing there looking straight down at the ground in front of us. We began to run when the wind brought us down to the ground. We had to stop in our tracks when we got up close to the tree. The first thing we saw was a tuft of furry hair growing. We thought the tuft of fur was a snake, but no one had ever seen a snake before. Then, all of a sudden, a strong gust of wind brought us right back down to the ground, crashing into it with a terrible crash. We were able to catch the tuft of fur and we yanked out the tuft of fur, and threw the strand on the ground. The fur then became cold to the touch, and we used our mittens and scarfs to warm ourselves. We found a few twigs and dried them on the fire, just enough so that it wasn’t an ache to our skin. Using our mittens as an anchor and the twigs as a sling we made our way to the top of the mountain where our house stood. We took our shelter there, and waited for the wind to die down and for the storms to stop, before taking a long journey back down the valley to get some food, milk, and water. The storm passed by us, but luckily for us, the next storm would arrive when we were eating lunch on the deck. The wind had passed by, but not before the storm had left us, leaving us in a strange place. The wind had blown the strands of nettle from their roots. The wind had also forced the leaves of the trees that were around the valley, to fall to the ground. They were falling on us like hailstones. It rained, but we could barely see.","In the early morning hours, a storm broke over the mountains. The wind was brisk, and in the afternoons the snow would pile up in the valley. Before we knew it, the walls of our valley had been blown down and we could see no sign of life. We stood there dumbfounded as the storm grew stronger. We couldn’t believe it! We ran across the valley into a clearing and looked across to the distant hills. There stood a tiny family on the far side of the clearing, staring down towards the valley, with a frightened expression, all eyes focused on them. The young girl was lying there in a pool of water. We knew immediately that she was in danger. We called for help. The storm had passed. The snow was melting. Suddenly we heard the rumble of the car doors slamming through the forest. We were so relieved. After a while the car began to roll away. One by one the children screamed. The last one was taken. And so we ran across the valley. The wind was brisk, and our hearts pounded with the sudden energy and intensity. It could only be our son. We rushed down towards the ridge to meet him on the other side. Then we headed for the safety of the trees. The child opened its eyes to see a tiny girl carrying an olive branch. It was her, and she looked at him. He was a tall, thin boy with dark blonde hair and blue eyes. He was pointing at the trees. We took a deep breath, and watched as his mother sat on the branch, unable to breathe. The wind whipped through the trees and shook the branches against the trees. Seeing the girl, she trembled and she turned. He was the last one standing. The wind shifted slowly and she could see through the trees into the valley. Her eyes widened with fear, not knowing whether he would find a way to protect them or if the storm would come again. With the wind howling at her face we headed toward the shelter of the trees to protect ourselves. As we went, the cliff side started to slip away, and we climbed onto the cliff where there was another stream. It had been a while since we had seen water. There was no way the water could reach us, it was too shallow and we knew there was nothing for us to do but jump off. As we approached it we could see the water coming towards us, and we both knew what we had to do. We both ducked under the branches and rolled with the rushing water. We stayed with the water for some time as it trickled down the mountainside. We were able to take the edge off the cliff, and climbed up the other side of the cliff face to get back to safety. There was no reason to stay there, it was only our small family and the trees whose lives were at stake. We knew then that we had to make the move. The trees twisted into a huge twisted tangle. We knew the roots had been digging deep for some time, but even more important, we knew the roots had been planted deep inside the cliff face for months, possibly for years. Whether the roots were deep inside the cliff faces or not was a question of what was inside the cliff faces. This is how we all survived in the valley, and it was only through their help that we survived.",We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival. It was the year when the storms came early before the calendar even hinted at winter even before November was out.,"Our valley was filled with wild animals, birds and flora; each of them with its own distinctive smell, its own identity and a personality of its own. We were not aware of this until much later, when we found ourselves caught between two warring forces that were determined to kill our beloved pet squirrel and our own mother. The village of Bochko was in the most dangerous predicament at the time; the town’s mayor, a man of influence, was desperate and he used espionage as a tool to gain control over the town and save the people. When the first rumors began to spread that they might be a threat to our safety, the people quickly united and agreed to cooperate with any information gathered. We then set up camp in the high, rocky field where a nearby farmhouse had been built. The village had been established with an axe and a shovel as the first defensive measure; but the inhabitants had been sucked into the vortex of violence, and our community of four started to crumble. It seemed like time was running out. The local people had no idea of the risks that our community was facing. They began to worry, to feel that the authorities and the government were more interested in killing them. We looked for shelter in the hut built on the hill, but the next thing that we knew a huge avalanche was tearing its way down, slashing through our camp, killing all of us in the process. We watched as the avalanche ripped the roofs off our tents, and twisted our bodies through the branches of the trees. My sister had been sleeping next to me, but she was awakened by her phone and could not sleep – at least not until it was over. Our children were huddled together in the hut and we prayed that God would help us survive this."
B2,"She had an apt name, Miss Rita Cohen. The name she used for herself had to do with the fact that she had lived there for some time and had come to live on the street. While we were in our yard one afternoon Marie asked if there was any way that she could have been there for a month, as it was quite impossible that there was a person like her living in the city. Seymour explained that when the police saw her on the street they could hardly believe it. That's when he noticed the shoes on her feet. ""Why don't you leave?"" said Marie. Then he asked, ""Do you wish to make a donation to the Jewish Community Center?"" ""No. I can't. The building isn't big enough, besides."" ""I'm sorry about that. But I am on my way to the cemetery tomorrow. I can't come today to help a little boy, though."" ""Yes, of course,"" answered Seymour. ""And I will have some pie for you."" ""Oh, I know,"" replied Miss Rita. ""I'd like to help, and I'm sure we can do it.""","Seymour's daughter Marie was eight years old when Seymour married his lovely daughter in 1906. The family was very poor and Seymour wore his mother's coat and gloves. To the other children he was a very good friend and the little girl had been very well taken care of by him. In all this time she had never asked for anything but respect and kindness. After her marriage, Seymour found her to be very charming and cheerful. He had found her to be a charming, clever and kind-hearted girl. Seymour always admired her for her kindness and he hoped that she would always remember this.","In the kitchen, Marie, after a quick cup of tea, had cooked a plate of sweets and a cup of tea and sat there, looking rather rapt. Miss Rita asked Marie how she could eat so much sweets and he explained that she was hungry from all the supper. It happened to be a meal of pies with ice cream and, although she was hungry, she was very contented. “I am not hungry,” said Marie, pointing at the pie that she had just made.",This is a story written for Grade 2 learners. This story follows the adventures of Seymour and his friends who help an old man who is in trouble. In spite of all difficulties they eventually come to a happy ending with the help of a local farmer.,"Seymour, a widower, felt a deep sadness at the thought of his daughters growing up and leaving him. Although he was very proud of Marie, his wife was always very nervous and unsure of herself and never knew when to be honest or not. A short time ago she was ill, and when Seymour heard her tell that her doctor had told him she had been in a coma for two days she decided to move in with him. Marie went to Marie's room when she heard Marie was gone. ""Don't worry,"" said Seymour. ""Your mother will see you tomorrow."" Seymour's mother then looked at Marie and saw that she was very pale, and had a very red cheek. ""That's why you want to be a cook. Don't you want to make the best of it?"" she asked. ""I do have a special place for you, Mom. My daughter will sleep with you tonight if you want to stay over, and she will even cook dinner for you if you like.""","Seymour Seiff, a little older than Seymours daughter Marie, had been to a boarding school to study engineering. The first teacher to teach there in 1772 was Miss Rita Cohen, a very pretty and intelligent young woman. Her face was so pale and pale that she looked as though she had had many colds but, with a little extra care, she could probably ward off the colds. At first, Marie did not understand what all the fuss was about. Seymour took her for a walk in the park and explained that when Rita told her father about the colds, her mother would have to be very careful.",Miss Rita Cohen a tiny pale-skinned girl who looked half the age of Seymour's daughter Marie but claimed to be some six years older came to his facto1y one day.

B2,"WHICH MANY WOMEN WOULD CHOOSE? Simplistic elegance - a trend which will continue for a long time: A great number of women today will choose a simple, classy, pared down look. 'They'll wear dresses for work and for night time, without feeling underdressed,' Ned Ingham says. 'They'll be wearing soft, flowing skirts and lightweight tops. They'll have light shoes, they'll wear a coat. They'll use neutral accessories.' The style-conscious - a trend which has been dominating women's fashions for years - are increasingly choosing a more relaxed style of dressing. Ned Ingham's own dresses are a prime example. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles.' His collections reflect a desire for 'elegance, simplicity and femininity', with a certain understated elegance. They often feel softer and less formal than the stiff dresses worn in previous years. 'Some of my customers are saying that they'd prefer to have a dress which is not very long, rather than a long frock. If you can, have a couple of dresses that are similar lengths, with a little detail to them, so they look more glamorous,' he says. 'I always do alterations on dresses and make sure they look just as I intended' he adds. This season the colours of'simple' styles like tweed, tweed-look and the classic black are the big ones. If you have a very simple idea of your style, a dress with a sash or a curved hemline which highlights your waist, might be the look for you. 'It's very stylish to have an overall shape rather than a fixed, full skirt. So they look a little like trousers, so the waist is accentuated,' he explains. People with a sense of style are also likely to avoid coloured dresses for obvious reasons: 'It makes them feel out of place.'

B2,"While the general consensus is that talented children should be rewarded for their talent, this is not always the case. Parents often fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. In the UK, there are only about 250 specialist music schools which provide tuition for children aged between 2 and 16 years who have outstanding musical ability - mainly for vocal and instrumental study. However, one specialism which is rapidly gaining popularity is the musical development centre. Specialist music schools are designed for children, from birth, who demonstrate exceptional musical aptitude that is not a consequence of having other talents, or, often, having other difficulties. Many parents think they must be ""super devoted"" if their child wants to study at these schools. However, parents don't have to take up this role. Parents may choose to send their child to a music school simply because it's recommended by their GP. For many parents this is out of choice, and they are often in denial about their child's musical potential. Even if they aren't aware their child's ability might be so outstanding, the first step is to seek out information from the school about the services they provide. Once you have taken up this offer, it is important that you discuss the matter with your GP or a specialist music teacher, such as a music specialist. The school may be able to advise you on how to encourage your child's musical development. However, parents shouldn't be worried if their child is ""very good"" at something. ""Good"" children are not always the most gifted. Children with special needs can learn and flourish on their own but may benefit from the support of others who have a similar need. Parents can also take a very positive approach by looking for the best opportunities for their child, and the best resources for their child's development. Specialisms include singing, violin, music theory, piano, guitar, drums, violin, voice, violin, keyboard, flute, violin, recorder, saxophone, piano, organ, trumpet, percussion, flute, piano, guitar, violin, piano, organ, trumpet, saxophone, percussion, saxophone, keyboard, drums, guitar, piano, percussion, violin, organ, flute, saxophone, keyboard, recorder, percussion, guitar, piano, cello, flute, saxophone, flute, cello, percussion, drums, cello, trumpet, recorder, cello, violin, trumpet, saxophone, piano, percussion, violin, violin, trumpet, trombone, trumpet, trumpet, saxophone, trombone, flute, guitar, string bass, string bass, saxophone, guitar, string bass, percussion, guitar, saxophone, violin, cello, percussion, violin, violin, trumpet, saxophone, saxophone, saxophone, piano, string bass, trumpet, clarinet, trombone, violin, saxophone, piano, violin, saxophone, string orchestra, choir. Whether your child is a gifted singer, an outstanding instrumentalist, an outstanding musician, or a shy child who simply loves music, you will want to explore the ways in which you can support your child's musical development. For some parents, taking the lead in organising a music school may be their first step in this process. But if you do go ahead, be sure to check with the school to find out where they operate. You will also need to do some research to see what services they offer as well as the fee they charge. In some cases, if a child is enrolled in a specialist school, they may be required to attend a separate music camp at a later date. For example, some parents will pay for a year's camp, even if the child already attends regular music school. Others will choose a private music school, even though they can pay on a scholarship, for the time they spend attending the music camp. If you take the lead in this regard, your child may be put at the bottom of the hierarchy of musicians in their school. The schools may not provide this support and it's important to try and arrange this for your child when they start at school. If your child's musical talent is not as advanced as you would like them to be, you can seek advice from parents who have taken this route. If you don't find a school that will provide this","I have a son who is a brilliant musician. He has been in specialist music schools since he was four, and the first year he started there his teachers screamed and the other students had to be quiet so the children would learn at a faster rate. But, unfortunately, when he started out at the primary school there was a new student every week, so it was a constant struggle. I decided that it was best to take him to a specialist music school as this was the only way to give him the best chance of learning to play the instruments that he really wanted. My son is now aged five, and has just started piano lessons. After attending a specialist music school, he has been able to excel in his academic work and is now a top school student. He has been playing for the county orchestra, and has even been elected in his school music examinations as the best player in the school. I can see that with his outstanding musical ability, he is going to go on to become an outstanding musician and achieve his ambitions. I would recommend a specialist school to anyone with a child with a musical ability. It is a brilliant idea.","Parents say that putting a child in a specialist music school is a ""last resort"" to prevent them from becoming frustrated and being able to express their feelings. The parents of a three-year-old who plays the violin and is a specialist for the Royal Academy of Music say it isn't. It was a choice that they had to make about five years ago when their daughter, Lucy, began playing the violin. When she attended the Royal Academy of Music her teacher, Michael, told her: ""You're doing a fantastic job, you just want your child to be able to enjoy the music as much as possible."" In that moment Lucy's mother, Christine, realised that ignoring Lucy's musical gifts could result in her daughter becoming unhappy and disengaged. It wasn't something she could ignore. She decided her daughter needed to take violin lessons but the school was charging her for the additional tuition, which she felt wasn't worth it. That year she brought Lucy to see her mother. Within an hour she had fallen in love with the piano and a year later was playing and singing with the Royal Academy of Music orchestra. By then Lucy was having problems with her teacher. Then she was dropped off at the Royal Academy of Music to try and find a better school. Christine says: ""We were having so much trouble finding a suitable school for her and we didn't know what to do or what to expect. ""She looked like such a bright child, but she looked so withdrawn. ""We could hear that she wasn't really happy. ""We looked in every school. I saw that she just wasn't happy at all. ""I was very worried. We just looked for somewhere where she would get along better. ""There was no other option. You can't cram everything in a day and expect your child to thrive. ""There are only four years before the age at which your child needs to have a taste of music. I knew that if we let Lucy have lessons and gave her all the attention and practice she needed she would have all the success that she has and she would just have a lot of time to do nothing. That was when Christine realised that Lucy needed a specific type of training. Christine had a nagging feeling that she was not getting enough from her piano lessons. ""I really wanted her to have the ability to really savour the experience of playing with other people and to be able to really understand music."" Christine admits that she worries about the future because her daughter's talents could have other problems. ""I'm afraid if Lucy doesn't get the right help she could become very unhappy. She doesn't need anyone to tell her if she's doing something right or wrong. She's got enough to think about without worrying about her skills. ""If she goes to the cheapest music school with the cheapest piano teacher she'll never go to a more expensive music school and never be able to enjoy her musical talents. Music is a very innate part of her being and we just want her to enjoy it as much as possible."" For her daughter it was important for her to get a sense of how musical schools work before she even started to think about enrolling her daughter into a specialist music school. At the Royal Academy of Music Lucy is currently studying viola, clarinet and cello at the Royal Academy of Music. She also performs in the Royal Academy's annual gala, organised by the parent union. ""He has been doing really well in his lessons, he is really enjoying learning it as well,"" she says. ""The music schools he has been to are so fantastic. ""I think he would love to go into a classical school."" But she admits she feels like she needs to be part of the school community, and that there isn't the opportunity for a more mainstream experience. ""When you go into specialist music schools, there are other kids like him and they will be all the same and there will be all the other kids in the hall with them. They will all be learning to play with other kids which is just not going to cut it. My son is not a musician.""","In a world of instant gratification, parents of gifted children often fail to recognise and respond to their child's need for musical training until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. As a result, gifted children are often left without appropriate opportunities for musical training. As a result, gifted children often develop challenging behaviours as their need for extra training becomes more apparent. The same applies to children who have difficulty managing their emotions, or who have difficulty concentrating in class. Is it right for my child to go to a specialist music school? Does it make sense to send my child to the music school of my own choice? How should I react to my child demonstrating a lack of concentration in class? What does being a gifted child mean for my family? What is my role as the primary carer, and how should I respond to my child's needs? How do I treat and discipline my gifted child? Should I seek professional help for my gifted child?","As my son grows, I am also increasingly aware of the value of his musical talent. As parents it can be easy to take our children’s musical development for granted, as children can be a clumsy bunch and even uncooperative.

He comes from a musical family. His grandmother died when Michael was a toddler. His mother said that Michael had been playing the flute from very early on, but then stopped.

When I stayed with Michael last night he said that it was the best holiday ever! Michael plays the flute at home regularly. We've found a home at the Academy of Music in Southgate. When Michael was nine years old he was able to attend a public school music class. The teacher explained to him that his son had been gifted at musical ability and had been accepted to the Academy from the age of eight. However, as Michael had made a mistake when choosing a school he had not realised that the school was not just for children at that age. This is when the situation deteriorated. Michael's mum said that she thought that the school was only for older children and was concerned for the future."

But as his eldest son, George, grows up, Matt realises just how much work and stress his life has been.","When Matt left the insurance business, he bought an empty farm and put it to work. He named it Farming. He named his dog Farmer. The dogs were very clever and loved him. One day Matt had an idea. He went to a friend of his. The friend said that the farmer was an insurance agent and that it might not be too difficult for him to learn how to run a sheep farm. He had no idea about anything related to farming but he thought he would go along and learn. He was very surprised when he learnt that he could milk cows and give sheep wool. Matt was so excited that he wanted to learn everything about it he could. He took a sheep and gave it a name.","Matt Froggatt once had a successful career in the City of London but he now runs a sheep farm in Sussex.

'It's a bit tricky because I've got some new responsibilities on the farm.' He bragged to his wife about it and said he would 'put on his big boy pants' and carry on farming and not feel sorry for himself. 'I'm a sheep farmer now's a great response and Matt said he'd be happy to help out any time. The sheep are really friendly now - they're the most important thing on the farm. His wife, Helen, now runs a small tea room and he's also a full-time shepherd.","Froggatt was one of the first in his generation to venture into the countryside, and his sheep farm is a big success. At the age of only 20, he bought his first sheep, which he named Froggatt's First Sheep.

C1,"After we received a challenge from Twitter, we changed lives for a day with four people - the challenge is to write about what we did on that day. Firstly, a story about the way we went about the swap. Next, a detailed account of our swap and an insight into the personalities of the four people. Finally, our final piece about our new lives. I was the first to know about this challenge and I was really interested in the responses from the four people who took part. My day included things like being the escort, driving to the office, taking a walk and going out for a coffee. The process was made much easier by the fact that we had set up a group on Facebook, the best part about it was that we had more than 40 people in total. We had four separate groups which we called swapper-groups, and one for the morning and one for the evening. Previously I had only heard from Rachel and Dave, so I thought it would be nice to hear from all four. On the morning of the swap, my day started with a brief introduction about all four of us. I had just moved in to a brand new house, so I told my friends all about it and made a little video which I would post on here as soon as we left. We then had breakfast, and then we set off for work and met up with the four people we were swapping with at 11:30. I had an afternoon at work in preparation for my day with my swapper, which started at 4pm and ended at 8pm. It was an exciting day for me, as I have had a few jobs in the past, and this day was the first time that I had had an entirely different job. I went from a single dad to a couple with two kids, which was so great and so different to what I had been used to. Everyone was so welcoming and polite, and everyone had fun. I knew that a lot of these people would be very nervous as this is what swapping lives meant to them. I knew that this was an opportunity I wanted to take advantage of. The swap was well organised, and we were all happy with the way we did the swap. We had a number of photos taken in various parts of the city - the main one was just the streets we had gone to the day before. It was a real eye opener to see all the different areas of the city. My favourite photo of the day was the bridge by the water. We got to see the amazing colours and the bridges were amazing. It was also fun taking photos on the train to get there as well. We also took photos in the streets of Glasgow as we got to go on a walk and see the area at night, but I will have to wait for another time. Everyone had a great time and it gave me a taste of what people do for a living.","We were a group of four friends. Each stayed up all night talking and laughing at the thought of switching lives with somebody for a day. We were so excited to start the day. We had had an early breakfast. We got dressed. We went to the shop. Our friend had prepared food for us. She had packed lunch and all the drinks. She gave us a cup of coffee. We looked at the time. We were planning to go to a bar. The bar was only about 2 kilometres from our apartment. So we started looking for somewhere to meet the bartender. We had heard about the bar before from friends who had seen it before. But then it became clear that the bartender needed some training. The bartender had some experience in dealing with the public. After the training he was ready to get the job. The bartender took us for a drink. We chatted and laughed the whole way. Then we had our lunch. We decided to go to the mall. The mall is big and had everything we could think of from clothes to drinks and foods to toilets. Our bartender took us to the burgers. He had some great ones including the rare, the medium, and the spicy. The beef and turkey were fantastic. The fries were tasty. The food was good. The staff were lovely. It was like meeting a new friend. I felt like I had lost a few pounds. We got back to our room. It was time to go. We had a quick chat about our day and then we went back to our apartment. It was hard getting settled in. We had breakfast. We had bacon and eggs. Then we had our sandwich and milk. We had some eggs and toast with some fruit. We then had pancakes and bacon and eggs. It was an amazing and fun day. We had a great day. The bartender was lovely and we have a lot of good memories of our day. The next day we met our friends in the mall for lunch. After a quick chat we went to the cafe for more food. We went for a jog in the park and went for a play. We were given stickers so that we could tell a story about our day. The day ended with us sitting outside together talking and laughing.","For a few days, in September 2013, I, along with four other students and three lecturers at the University of Southampton, swapped lives with students from Utrecht University. Their host families invited them to stay at the University of Southampton hostel in Southampton City Centre for a night to spend together, and we swapped lives for the day. Each family had to make their own arrangements to come to the campus: how long the exchange would last, what they would do to prepare for the exchange, how to prepare for the experience and how much they were allowed to spend in each place. We organised the whole experience by contacting all four students and lecturers to ask their permission and to make sure the people who were coming up with the idea and booking the accommodation agreed with us. We had our own transport from the hostel to the university, so we had to come to Southampton on the same day as their host families. Once we arrived, we had to sign an agreement. The hotel gave each of us a suitcase – two pairs of jeans and one pair of shoes. For the exchange we also wore hats and bags that were all named after one of the students we were swapping, so we could have a little bit of our own style of dress and take a few photos. The swapping parties then began in earnest, with a group photo of each group in turn. We gathered at the hostel early enough that we had plenty of time to get ready before our guests arrived. We all checked in and were given a welcome message from the hosts. We were then escorted to our rooms and were ushered into our new homes. We all took the time to get to know each other, and we had to tell them who we were and why we wanted to swap lives. We had dinner together in a special restaurant named after one of the participants, and then a short talk. We then did some homework and had a nice chat with our new friends before heading off to bed, knowing that the day was over, and that we would be meeting back up on Friday.","After our chats, we started our swap. The first thing we did was to plan who we were swapping with. There were quite a lot of rules to follow as well as strict rules that had to be met in order to swap. The first one was that we had to make sure that we both worked the same job or had the same skill. There were some tricky ones in there as well. Then we also had to make sure that we were the same age as the other person. Then we swapped the details so that it was like a real life swap. This went off without a hitch and, even though we could have been in completely different lives, we made it work, although we had to go through some awkward situations too! As we got into the car, we realised we were in a completely different time zone. As well as that, we had to deal with lots of things that we didn’t know - such as how to change a flat-pack bed. We were in the city and had to get used to being a commuter, so we were not used to seeing a lot of the sights. Luckily, we managed to get our bearings and knew where most of the main attractions were. After swapping the locations, we went to a museum and saw an animatronic dinosaur. We saw an unusual kind of elephant, and even saw a tiger! After a day that was pretty chaotic, we arrived at our new home. At the airport we were very excited to meet our new people, but it took us time to get to grips with it. We spent a lot of time learning about other cultures and languages. Our host family was also our guide throughout the day. The whole family helped us learn how to get around, which made travelling much easier. The day ended with a trip to the beach with one of the hosts - and everyone in the family wanted to get home! This project was made possible by the BBC, and we would like to thank everyone who helped out on the day. In addition to our four guests, we also had a young photographer named Emma. She was very interested to see how other cultures lived, and she was happy to take pictures of our four guests.","A2 learners and those who wish to re-visit their English, this is a great post for you. We had the fantastic chance to swap lives with four people: a local business man, a linguist, a teacher and a student. It was a great day for everyone. The school was packed to the rafters with lots of young people and the two teachers had a ball. Here's my friend Simon telling a bit more about what we've been up to. ""It's the best day of my life so far,"" said Sarah. We greeted the local businessman at the entrance to school. He sat down and talked to us. ""How was the weather? How much work did you have today?"" ""Yes, it was great,"" said the teacher. ""It's actually one of the best days of my life."" Then it was our turn. Our teacher explained how we could swap lives. Sarah was looking after the businessman in the office, Simon was looking after the linguist, and I was looking after the student. We had lots of fun doing it. After lunch, we chatted more about what our differences are. What is your favourite colour? What TV shows do you watch? What kind of music do you listen to? What kinds of books do you read? How did you go about getting ready for this? 'What did you wear for your day today?' asked Sarah, incredulously. He started off in the right direction, but then quickly went wrong. ""What kind of music do you listen to?"" asked Simon. ""I'd say classical music, a lot of piano music."" ""Oh, wow, I've never been to an opera before. I have been to a few musicals, but never an opera."" ""But that's okay,"" said the other teacher. ""There's always a musical in the family."" When Sarah asked about our favourite music, Simon mused about the singer Michael Buble. He liked the music and talked about it a lot. ""Hmmm, it's quite different. What would you like to do for a day? Would you like to dance?"" ""I'd like to go on a night club trip."" ""Are you sure I'd like to go on a nightclub trip?"" asked the teacher. She nodded. ""I've always been interested in going out."" ""I would love to do the night club trip."" Sarah and Simon had an edgy conversation with a local bartender. It was like a party in their ears. Then Simon asked him what he wanted to do for a day. He explained he was having a go at salsa. ""So, what are you gonna do for a day?"" asked Simon. ""I'm not sure, I'm not sure,"" said Simon. ""I am wondering though. Do you have any special skills that you have that would be useful?"" Simon looked at his friends, his colleagues and his teachers and said, ""Wow! My English has really improved! I think I'm a better writer, more confident and confident!"" ""Well, I'm not exactly sure who you are - but you sound great!"" laughed Simon, who was now reminiscing about his time in Italy a year ago. We finished the day with a meal prepared by the young chef. ""It was nice to share this meal with someone else,"" said Simon. ""That's true,"" said Simon, who had been a very enthusiastic student. We got through the cooking. We had two dinners, one with a lot of vegetables and one with fish. We had a nice chat about some of our favourite restaurants, and we laughed a lot. ""Our Spanish teacher told us she was really impressed by our pronunciation. ""I like to repeat a sentence, like, how is your pronunciation in English?"" ""Well, my pronunciation is a lot better than yours."" Then Simon explained why he thought that the meal might have been a little strange. ""It's my Spanish teacher who told me I should try an English-style drink to get my pronunciation right. I guessed it was probably just wrong. It could be that she hasn't eaten it before."" Simon then explained the benefits of the Spanish way of speaking. He explained that the way you say your name is one of the most important elements of a person's identity. You don't know who your parents are, do you? Do you remember when you were a child? Or do you recall any of your friends' names being miss","We swapped lives for a day and it was really fun. The people that went on the swap were really nice people. They went to school, went shopping, took a trip to the movies, ate delicious food and we even got to eat some of each other's food! It was great fun.",We swapped lives for a day and took the photos and video clips as part of a fun project organised by the British Council for England. The aim was for the participants to explore the country as much as possible while having a good time. We took the photos of the participants for free using Flickr.com.
C1,"The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, says Georgina Ferry. But she is little known. The 61-year-old, the only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize, should be a household name in her own country, says Georgina Ferry. The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, she says. “She is a remarkable figure who was at the forefront of her profession and to this day she is admired.” She is referring to the Nobel Laureate Dorothy Hodgkin whose research into cancer in 1954 was considered the first step to the development of drug therapy. Ferry, who is working on the book, is the first to say that Hodgkin is a household name. She said: “Her influence on scientists and the public has been profound and continues to be. I love that.” She was born in 1924 into a middle-class family in north-west London, in a time when women did not hold senior positions in British universities. She received her PhD in physics from the University of Oxford, where she had worked as a junior engineer before joining Imperial College London in 1954. She later held a number of posts including head of research at a Cambridge University hospital. After becoming the first woman scientist to win the Nobel Prize, she led a successful career as a professor and then chair of biochemistry at Oxford. She is perhaps best known today for her work on hormones. But the Nobel committee rejected her application for a second prize for her work on hormones in 1981. Ferry says her book is a unique opportunity to tell the story of a women scientist in the British public sphere. It also represents an opportunity for those seeking to write about one of the most iconic women scientists in history.","A British scientist who has been largely unknown in her own country was awarded the Nobel prize this year, but that doesn’t mean she’s forgotten, according to a British-born biochemist. Georgina Ferry told the BBC how her research into how cells respond to drugs was recognised by the Nobel committee in 1960. “Dorothy was one of the first genuinely British scientists,” says Ferry, who is the author of two books on biology and medicine. “The Nobel committee felt it was important to reward Dorothy, who was a pioneering British scientist in immunology.” By 1963, there were only 74 Nobel laureates in the science and medicine fields, and only 71 women and 19 men won the prizes. “The whole thing had to be seen in perspective. It wasn’t just to recognise the extraordinary achievements of women scientists. It was to see that women and men were contributing to the same endeavour. “But there wasn’t that sense of belonging for women because of gender inequality,” says Ferry. The only British woman to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, she says. “She should be, because there is a whole body of science around her, some of which is very much gendered and it has a huge impact on women... [but] when she won, not all of it was from science.” Although her research has been recognised, she is largely ignored by the public. “No one is even aware she was female,” said Ferry. “There were some amazing men in her scientific circle, but she was the first woman scientist to win the Nobel prize for immunology,” she added. A biographer of her work and a member of the Science Museum Board, Ferry has written a detailed biography entitled Anatomy of the Mind. It is available on the Nobel website, but Ferry says her own efforts have only amounted to a single volume published in 2010. The book is about a young woman who fought to improve the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1943. She worked with Sir John Lewy to devise the treatment and argued against the use of corticosteroids, which were initially used to treat infections such as smallpox. Her recalcitrant children were kept in the ward and her husband died of cirrhosis when she was only 23. She went on to become the first woman to be honoured for her work in medicine, but her achievements were not without controversy. Hodgkin discovered she had cancer in 1960. She had also discovered that blood cells were immune to insulin, the first drug that could treat it. Her Nobel Prize was awarded in 1967, and she later became a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Ferry says the book is “the most comprehensive account of Hodgkin in this country” and she would like to see more people familiar with her work. The book is published this month. The title is also unusual in that she has not been named the first British woman to win the Nobel prize. She said in 2004 the prize was ""an injustice"" and the ""silly thing that no-one could have imagined"".","Its the only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize and the most recognised of the world's leading scientists. But she is almost entirely unknown among English people, and even fewer outside the UK. Georgina Ferry, a biographer and a member of the Royal Society who is working on Hodgkin's life story, has spent the past four years subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. She says she is working with a company called Hodgkin's House, the organisers of the 50th anniversary of Hodgkin's birth, to write a biography of the legendary pioneering British scientist. A few weeks ago she was blown away when her brother, who had gone on to receive a £83,000 scholarship from the US to study at the University of Cambridge, said that he had no idea that there was a person named Dorothy Hodgkin still doing research. ""It was a shock,"" she said. ""I told my family, but it was a shock to my father too. But he was pretty sure we should get some more information. And, as he was the only one to know about her, he felt he owes it to her."" Ferry says she is not interested in selling or distributing Hodgkin's life story, but says it is an honour to have the chance to explore her scientific achievements. She says: ""It was an absolute honour to be awarded this prize and, based on my research, I think it really should be a household name in the UK. And I would urge anyone interested in pursuing any career in science or a career in medicine, particularly women, to take a look at Hodgkin's story.""

A leading radiologist, Dr Dorothy Hodgkin earned a Nobel Prize for her work in the 1950s and 1960s. She discovered the genetic material for the cells that make up skin pigment called melanin. She was also a pioneer in immunology, helping develop vaccines against common illnesses including chicken pox and polio. The Nobel Committee awarded Hodgkin its inaugural prize for medical research in 1960 and her life was marked by a sense of accomplishment and achievement, from her early days in Cambridge when she was selected to join the Royal Astronomical Society as a member to the day that the winner was announced in 1967. The only British woman scientist ever to win a Nobel prize, she established the University of London’s MRC Laboratory of Molecular Genetics where it is now housed. The new biography, which is due for publication by Bloomsbury, will tell the story of a woman who became the first British woman scientist to win a Nobel, and the lasting impact on modern medicine of the discovery of melanoma. The 94-year-old is the only British woman scientist to win the Nobel and is also the only woman to win two Nobel prizes for medicine: she won the Nobel prize for medicine in 1964, but was denied the medal in 1969. The CBC and BBC will broadcast the book in a series of programmes about Hodgkin – including a BBC Two documentary about her life – from next month.","My answer is almost always ‘She died during a time of global scientific crisis in the 1930s but no one can recall’. I think of her as a very famous woman scientist. She won the Nobel prize for her discoveries on bone marrow in 1961 and later became the first British woman to receive the medal. But she isn’t exactly a household name in her own country. I think of her as a very famous scientist. Dorothy Hodgkin. She did her PhD at UCL before becoming a professor of medicine at the London Royal Free Hospital in 1942. The Nobel prize is the highest honour awarded by the Nobel Committee. Each year, the committee decides who will receive it. The latest judging panel to be made up of experts is due to meet later this year. And the winner is. Who is Dorothy Hodgkin? Why is she so little known in her own country? This question began to be asked of me in 2011. As I continued to work on the biography of the world’s most famous scientist, I found myself looking into her life and work for the first time ever. I had previously heard of other scientists, including Marie Curie and the Soviet ophthalmologist Sergei Tsienkov, who were also women, but in whose career they never published a book. I wanted to know more about how these women made their name so important in their careers. Throughout my career, I had been approached to write about women in science. I asked people who had a connection with these scientists for interviews. I was told of the great role these women played in the development of some of the earliest ideas in science and how these ideas would affect our life on earth. The results would help to change our world, and at the same time would improve our lives. I did not know the identity of Dorothy Hodgkin. I did not know why she wasn’t a household name. It wasn’t until this year that I knew about her. Having been in touch with the people behind the Hodgkin Prizes, I finally realised why this is the case. Dorothy Hodgkin was a brilliant scientist, one of the greatest women in science of all time. She revolutionised the way we understand the human body by discovering that the bone marrow is a complex network of cells and tissue that is more efficient and sensitive than any other organ. In fact, she had already developed two techniques used by other scientists that utilised the entire bone marrow. One is the use of magnetic resonance imaging. The other was a method of in vitro surgery which aimed to destroy the tumor cells inside the body without removing the tissue. Dorothy’s work gave rise to a number of scientific advances in her field, including the concept of the stem cell that was discovered by her husband Sir Fred Hodgkin in the 1920s. The stem cell concept gave way to the concept of a pluripotent stem cell that is a highly efficient form of cells that replicate themselves through the development of new forms of bone cells, the precursors of stem cells. Today the cellular structure and mechanism of a stem cell is more fundamentally understood than ever before. The Nobel committee should have been aware of Dorothy’s contribution to science when it awarded the prize in 1973 but they failed to do so. At that time, Hodgkin was at university working as an assistant to Sir Frederick Gurney. Gurney had been a medical student at the University of Edinburgh when Dorothy was a postdoc. She wrote about the work that had been carried out by Hodgkin and how it had changed life. In 1982 she won the Nobel prize for her discoveries in ophthalmic medicine. Then, at the age of 69, Dorothy died. Why was it that her name was not recognised? How could a Nobel prize have come to her when she could only get awarded it in 1962? In a 2007 article in the journal Nature, Hodgkin was able to reveal the complex structure and mechanisms of the ocular cells that make up our iris. Her discovery led to new medicine that has benefited tens of thousands of people around the world. It had opened up a wide range of medical possibilities in diseased eyes and helped scientists make a huge contribution to the advancement of medicine. The discovery of the ocular cells had been made possible by her pioneering work in the field of eye research, and allowed scientists such as Sir Frederick Gurney to use her technique on a much wider range of diseases, but it was not until she was 70 that the public started to notice her. A study carried out in 2012 showed that a 2% drop in the number of people who recognized her name compared to","Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win a Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is little known. So far this year I have asked 100 people to answer the question, and so far I haven't heard a single reply: Dorothy who? Hodgkin, in her nineties, who became the first woman to win the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine for her research in medicine. As a physiologist and teacher, Hodgkin took a special interest in helping patients and has been involved in many health campaigns. Her research and leadership have paved the way for dozens of scientists studying and treating diseases such as cancer. She has won eight awards for her work on cancer. She is known as a great scientist and a good woman in medicine. I am publishing a biography of her next year. Georgina Ferry is a research sociologist at Kings College London. She was born in Oxford and has lived in a range of countries around the world since she was a child. She graduated from Oxford with a BSc in physiology in 1976. She has worked in research and medicine for over 25 years and is now an independent researcher, who has written and edited a number of books.","Dorothy Hodgkin The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is little known."

""It's a really great piece,"" said Janson. ""It really has a layered quality to it. And it's very realistic. ""There's so much detail on the painting and all the objects look real when I look at it. And even though there isn't a lot of detail on the background, there's something going on there that you can only see on the painting. ""The painting is a really impressive painting. The detail is amazing. Everything is a different hue and you don't even realize it's real."" The painting is one of several in her series of ""Four Seasons,"" which is part of a series of paintings combining landscape and portraits. She plans to exhibit her works at the Contemporary American Art Museum in Dallas for the first time in May. ""I think it's just brilliant,"" Janson said. ""It's a huge, giant painting."" For the artist, the work has a timeless quality. ""You can think it's done in a sense by a long time ago, but it's still contemporary in this way."" Janson was born in England and moved to the United States when she was five. She studied art at New York University, where she began her studies with a degree in painting. ""I came back here and really fell in love with it, and I didn't leave,"" she said. ""I'm still here, and I think it's beautiful."" She earned an MFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York and a BA at Princeton, where she studied art history and art criticism, before being awarded a scholarship to attend The Rhode Island School of Design. ""The Rhode Island School of Design is probably the most impressive art school in the state,"" Janson said. ""It's the only school in the state that has an MFA program in art history and that's where it all started. And it is all real. I still find it amazing that I have to travel so far to see the work."" For her paintings to be the real deal, Janson must produce paintings that ""resist all forms of categorization and categorization within their own kind, without reference to any other kind."" One painting she did for the museum is a tree with a lopsided bark, topped off by a giant branch. ""It's the most impressive thing,"" Janson said. She was inspired by art professor Mark Rothko, who taught Janson at New York University. Janson is also fascinated by the history of trompe l'oeil in France and Germany, where artists tried to trick the eye by using paint and techniques that could be easily used in a different medium. ""It's just really difficult to make these a reality in a way that a painting could be,"" she said.","In Sarah Janson's paintings, real things seem to be painted over, like a wall paper cut in half. She said she didn't sign her work until she was asked to do so. Then she signed it and the other artists weren't sure where to get it. In some paintings, Janson has actually painted out parts of the wall. Sometimes she painted what was on the wall and painted things out of it. In this painting, the wolf is in fact painted over the wolf. In another painting, Janson's wolf is painted as if it's on the wall. When you are looking at it, you can't tell what is real and what isn't. ""I do the painting and I don't even sign it unless they ask me to. Unless there is a signature on it.""","Sarah Janson is an artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. In the film of a trompe-l'oeil painting she uses the same technique, as the famous artist James Turrell, to captivate audiences. She has a keen interest in science and the way the brain works. It was at a museum in London where she was invited to work with three young children. To begin with, Sarah had to explain to the children that the painting they were looking at was not real. After that, it was more about making it look as though the children had made the painting themselves rather than what it was. It was an experiment that the kids liked.",Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt.,"I read about the work of Sarah Janson recently. She penned a blog post about this art form. This post was written in order to introduce readers to the work of Sarah Janson, a trompe-l'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. There are not many artists who will not sign their work unless they are asked to. Sarah Janson, a trompe-l'oeil artist, painted a portrait of an Irish man standing on a cliff edge and surrounded by clouds. Her painting, titled The Misty View, aims to make viewers forget that they are looking at a painting of the landscape. Janson uses colours and lighting to make the image appear as though it is more than a painting, and has created a special type of mirror to give an even more surreal effect. She uses a painting in order to create the impression that the painting is still there, but it is no longer.","Sarah Janson paints realistic, lifelike creatures in her trompe-l'oeil paintings, whose purpose is to give the illusion that they actually exist. These creatures are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of movement, depth, and texture. For Sarah, art is a powerful way to express herself. She makes many copies of her paintings and leaves them on display at the Royal Botanic Garden in London. She paints tens of thousands of copies of each piece in order to create a high demand for her work. Sarah says that it takes the artist months to produce a single print. She never wants the customer to know how many times she has produced a piece. 'It's like if someone said 'Wow, your work is incredible. Your work looks like a'real' image.'' Her process of making a print takes six weeks, and she is not satisfied unless the customer is happy with the print. When she is satisfied with the print, she will put it on show in London. When she doesn't, it is on show in Australia and California. The biggest draw of her work is the dazzling effect it has on others.","Sarah Janson, a painter whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality, was interviewed by Joanna Watt for BBC London."
C1,"The book contains two sagas that span several centuries. The story of the origins of the republic of Efica tells of an ancient land where a great empire was formed by the Romans and where the nobles of the time worked under the benevolent reign of Emperor Hadrian. It is written in the first person first person alternating between the sagas of the emperor and his son the ruler. Efica has three sagas in the form of: The Chronicles of the Empire by David Foster Wallace the story of the kingdom of Aroin which he created for his father; The Chronicles of the Republic by George R.R. Martin the story of the great and infamous king of Efica; The Chronicles of the Republic by George R. R. Martin. The story of Tristan Smith a citizen of the republic of Efica. The saga of Tristan is set in Efica during the reign of King David Foster Wallace and he is the first saga to have been published in the world. In the saga of Tristan the first century is filled with many tragedies and events that take place in the world. In the first year the kingdom was founded by William III. Tristan grows up in the saga of King David. The kingdom is peaceful and there is no shortage of food. A group of soldiers led by Tristan set off on an expedition to search for evidence proving that the Emperor of Aroin had been murdered. They soon discovered evidence that was too valuable to allow anyone to go to it. Tristan is a victim of the great conspiracy the king has devised. He and a group of English officers go to Aroin to kill the dictator. During their campaign the soldiers make friends with a gang of henchmen who use them to steal money from the emperor. They also steal a small army ship. The ship becomes too unmoored from its moorings and a fire destroys everything aboard. Tristan must escape to the north of Efica and try to locate the ships captain and an ally of his father the king. The three sagas are set within the framework of a grand conspiracy of the king and his closest ally the governor he has enlisted and their plot to destroy Aroin is uncovered. A small army is sent to Aroin to destroy the king. As an emperor they send the British army to capture Aroin. In the saga of king David the king is constantly in battle with his opponents as well as numerous forces of infamy. The saga of King David will be of great interest to any reader who enjoys an engaging tale with a hint of humour. The characters are well developed and the plot is entertaining. The saga is told with great skill and with a great deal of wit. The characters are very different in every chapter, as are their individual personalities. One chapter in particular deals with Tristan and his saga of king David and his throne. While most people have a soft spot for the emperor in Efica Tristan often has difficulty connecting with his actions and those of the king. There are two themes that run throughout the book and it is only a matter of time before the truth can be revealed. The first was a series of events which had the emperor tortured by an incendiary who then turned into a stone. This torture was intended to break the heart of David himself. Another scene is a plot to poison the king. There was an incendiary who wanted to avenge the deaths of his friends. This incendiary killed many of the enemies of the emperor. Another was the destruction of the temple that he had been forced to build to worship a fallen king. What is the point of all of this? It’s the destruction of a great empire, and Tristan finds it hard to see how this type of torture could be justified in any situation. He believes that the only reason the emperor is being tortured is to give him a sense of power and glory but he does not doubt that he is doing what he can to survive. Tristan spends most of the book hunting the infamy of his actions, especially when he ends up in an unexpectedly good position as spokesman for his saga, even though this position is only temporary, and that he has to be brave enough to fight it.","After a disastrous attempt to become a tyrant Tristan Smith finds his life in danger. He is sent to live with a family in a small village on the coast of a remote lake in Efica. There he becomes interested in politics and begins studying history. At a party one of the guests is the tyrant and a young man who once fought a dragon appears to offer him a job. He offers him his seat in the village council and then the throne as king. Tristan accepts and is soon elected to be a king of his village but is soon sent to jail. On returning from a trip to Spain Tristan is surprised to find the town in disarray after having been robbed by an unknown assailant. He soon realizes that Efica is nothing like the fictional Efican Republic he grew up in and finds it difficult to accept that the people he once loved have been taken captive. Tristan learns more about his new home and the people who inhabit it and begins to question what is really going on in his town. What is it that he has discovered? Tristan begins to wonder whether there are any good men left in Efica or whether he is being led to commit the most terrible crime of all. His life is changed by an unexpected meeting with a priest named Elie and some old friends, and he begins to understand the true extent of power of the king.","Tristan Smith is the son of a merchant who has served his country for eight years. However, it is a short service that has led to terrible consequences. Efica is a tiny island republic inhabited by the only citizen of the island. Tristan is a man of high education and social class. In addition to his own talents he is the recipient of the King’s Gold Medal, the only distinction a citizen can have in the Efican society. He is a man of integrity and honour, but he is also a man of ambition. In spite of this his father’s love for him has always been unwavering. The King always wishes to marry a woman of higher standing. Tristan is forced to compete in a game to prove he is as good as his father. Unfortunately, the game falls through if a player is not the right age. When the game ends he loses his life. When he is convicted he is fined and detained in prison. This puts Tristan in a quandary: If he is old enough he has to wait until he is 70 in order to be a citizen again. If he is young enough he cannot even enter the games. As the story progresses Tristan’s character becomes more complex. As a young man he falls in love with a stranger named Jerome. He quickly realises that there’s more to Jerome than meets the eye and becomes fascinated with him, as well as by the people and government that surround him. He’s interested in his ancestors too. However, he does have one problem. Jerome seems more mature than his father. He has recently died. Can he find the answers to some of the mysteries that are plaguing the country? For the book is set in Efica a fictional nation where time has slowed. Its economy is depressed and the government has made life difficult for most citizens. What is worse the currency is weak. A large amount of gold goes to the citizens through a complex system of taxes. Citizen Tristan Smith is a kind hearted person. However, he has little appreciation for the people. One day he is asked to do a secret mission for the King and becomes interested in it. The citizen of Efica is called the Ambassador to a king. After doing this he is dragged into the King’s court and questioned about the mission. The Ambassador explains that Jerome must be present to receive the reward. Jerome is not the only person who is interested in the mission. The Minister of Finance flies the Ambassador to a distant land where he tries to get Jerome to visit him there. During his trip he meets a girl who has recently lost her husband. The girl gives Jerome the opportunity to help him escape with her. Jerome offers Tristan the opportunity to go to the king. But while he is in the king’s court a strange young man comes to him. He wants to marry Tristan. It turns out that the young man is very young. The young man is quite smart and is genuinely interested in Tristans life. He becomes jealous of Jerome as he watches him. Ultimately Jerome wants Tristan to become president. When Tristan goes to the king for help Jerome gets jealous of him. Jerome is a jealous man and makes comments to the young woman, but Tristan denies this. This is when Jerome comes along. The young man offers Tristan his land. Tristan falls in love with Jerome and they marry, but Jerome and Tristan fall in love, and the young man is a man of power. He then goes to the king and begs for help with the mission, asking if Jerome will help. The king listens and decides that he will help. He offers Tristan his land as a reward for a good report on the mission. As Tristan travels to Efica he meets people from all walks of life, and he discovers a new love in his own childhood. Along the way he meets people who have been told in the past that they have a gift for Tristan. He is unable to speak to Jerome because of his past. He is also unable to speak to his father when he has problems with him, but he knows that he has to face his fears if he wants to have any chance of achieving his goals. While in the kings court he is forced to confess that he doesn’t belong and that ","Tristan Smith is a citizen of the fictional republic of Efica a nation located at the pole of a vast cosmic storm. He has been imprisoned and tortured and his friends and neighbours all refuse to believe that he should be allowed to return to Efica in the hope that he will be found guilty and punished by the citizens. But one day he wakes up in a hospital after a shipwreck. He meets with a doctor who promises him an opportunity to be reunited with his friends. Tristan then enlists in the military and finds he has a fighting chance. Tristan begins his journey as an ordinary citizen on the run from the government. When the world explodes around him he discovers that a group of gangs who have a common enemy known as the triads have taken up residence in a city on the pole. The triads are led by a boy named Lucan, who is called the Thief of Efica by his gang. Tristan is soon captured by the triads and taken away to Efica. There he finds friendship with the son of a priest who has promised to share his kingdom with him. The new king promises Tristan that the triads will be treated equally. With that promise the triads recruit Tristan to help them fight the triads. He is soon caught, beaten by the triads, thrown into prison for life and sentenced to a gruesome death. Tristan then finds a job as a janitor in a university town with the same view and a similar problem with Lucan. There he meets a very unusual old man who offers him a job removing the naive and foolish people from their lives. This is all part of a plan to bring on an invasion by the triads, who are determined to bring Efica into darkness. Once the triads are caught Tristan is able to save his friends and the lives of others. He finds a way to bribe the police and enlists in the navy. He then becomes a policeman, becoming one of the citys top detectives. He is even tasked with protecting the newly appointed emperor. Eventually Tristan finds himself the king of Efica. However he soon finds himself on the back foot as the triads take control of the country. The triads attack Tristan, his friend Lucan and an old friend, who escapes by jumping into the ocean and drowning. When he finally arrives at the shore he is chased by the triads and beaten to a pulp.",A parable of human power history and humour set in the fictional republic of Efica.,"Tristan Smith, the only good citizen of Efica, has a dream about an ice queen: if he could just get the king to give her the queen and their three small children (they are old enough to be free from oath if they do not know what it is). After much dreaming and research, he gets the answer he has been waiting for: there is a woman named Lulu. But a princess isn't a princess until she is a young woman, and the king isn't a prince until he is forty years old and she is a woman. There's a lot of background on that in the book. Lulu is a princess (she looks and acts like a child compared to the women of Efica) but she is actually a queen because she is infertile.",The career of citizen Tristan Smith set in the fictional republic of Efica is an extraordinary parable of human power history and humour. In a feat of considerable literary skill the author has created a world with its own history traditions and customs.
C1,"Hakan Hardenberger was born in 1982 in a village in Sweden. His mother, who had no musical training at all, was a pianist in her spare time. While playing the piano, she taught her son to play the trumpet. It took three years, but when Hakan was eight his father joined him and he began studying with Michael Brecker. He was so good that he performed alongside the best musicians in the world, even the famous trumpet-players Gershwin and Miles Davis. By the time he was 16, Hakan had played with these world-famous musicians. Hakan grew up listening to his father’s music, but there wasn’t much else he could play besides the piano, and even his father couldn’t play the trumpet. “It took years of practice and I just learned how to play the trumpet so I figured that there must be more to me than that. It took six years of study, and then in 2001 I started the Trumpet Masters at Yale University. I played with the best trumpeters in the world at the time. But I was studying a lot more than just playing music, because I was learning about the mind and the brain,” said Hakan. For the next five years Hakan followed a course at the Royal College of Music, studying classical and jazz guitar, trumpet and bass guitar. He became acquainted with many musicians who played in the great orchestras and bands of the 20th century, such as Count Basie, Glenn Miller and Lennon/McCartney and was given opportunities to study and perform with orchestras such as the London Symphony and the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra. “My parents were very musical but didn’t think they should have let me go to a school where there was such a strong musical culture,” he explained. Hakan studied privately with his teacher, Michael Brecker, for four years and was accepted to the Berklee College of Music, a musical institution in Boston, Massachusetts. Hardenberger was accepted because he had no previous experience playing trumpet. He played with several of the finest trumpet players in the world, including such masters as the late James Galway, who is often considered one of the greatest trumpet players of all time. Hardenberger was one of the last students of his teacher, Carlo Pecci, who studied classical music with his father. Hardenberger says he found the Berklee education quite strange because it was one of the only times that he was allowed to play in large groups and was part of the famous Berklee College of Music’s student band. “It was something I hadn’t done before and I was really terrified by it,” he remembers. After the school Hardenberger was invited to play for a wedding. But he stayed away from music, and didn’t take music seriously until he was 19 and had played in his father’s band and at a concert when he was 15 years old. Hardenberger studied classical guitar with Stefan Hjalmarsson and has been working with various prominent composers such as Philip Glass, Robert Schumann, John Williams, Alanis Morissette and many others. Hardenberger has also participated as a conductor and worked as a conductor for the Swedish national orchestra and in other orchestras all over the world. This is a brief article about Hakan Hardenberger’s extraordinary career, a story written by Jonny Connors, a freelance writer, who is currently studying a Bachelor’s in music at the Royal Danish Academy of Music.","The trumpet isn’t just for Christmas... It is strange how many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Out of the blue, Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden, has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world’s trumpet-players today.","Hakan Hardenberger is the only son of completely unmusical parents. His father runs a small shoe manufacturing business and his mother is a schoolteacher. Their two sons have never been exposed to music, which Hakan started playing the trumpet as an adult. The hard-working trumpet player now has the most successful record of any Scandinavian trumpet player ever. Hakan Hardenberger became a star in Sweden when he was 17. He is also the only trumpet player who has been awarded a Grammy. “I think if you study for too long you lose the ability to play a bit.” So he enrolled in a music academy in Stockholm where he was taught to play the trumpet. He then began taking lessons from the local teacher of the age of 20. In 1996 he formed his own band, which performed at major festivals across Europe. Hakan Hardenberger was born on 4 September 1974 in a country district of southern Sweden. He grew up in a home where music was not an important part of his life. He didn’t learn to read or write, and was never exposed to music from his early age. In his teens he began taking lessons from a trumpet-player, a piano-player, a guitar-player, a singer-songwriter, a violinist and several others. He grew up learning to read music from different artists who played other instruments in the family, especially classical music. Hakan’s father taught him to play the piano but was so impressed by the music he played that he refused to give up his job as a bus driver. So he enrolled at a music school in Malmö, in Sweden. In 1995 he began taking trumpet lessons at the age of 22. He then went on to take up studies with the jazz trumpeter David Zinman at the Malmö jazz school. After many dozens of hours studying Zinman’s music, he landed a job with the jazz orchestra at the Malmö opera house. Hakan Hardenberger now plays with this huge orchestra and in the summer season in Copenhagen, he plays with them too. One day Hakan Hardenberger’s trumpeter told him that he was invited to his first major concert as a professional. He was invited to the concert because there were two big names who would play. He couldn’t afford to make the concert and so he opted not to go. The concert was cancelled due to a snowstorm but he still played the concert. When it was over he decided to leave Malmö for New York and now lives in New York City where he plays in the Lincoln Center Orchestra.","Hakan Hardenberger is the only son of totally unmusical parents. At the age of 5 years, Hakan and his parents moved to a small country district in southern Sweden. Hakan has always had a passion for music. The only time he has ever heard a trumpet played was when he was a young boy with his grandfather when he was on his way to the country fair in Vaxjo, a small town in the region. The town is called Vaxjo and is only 5 km from the sea, a kilometer from the nearest town. In this small town of just under 800 inhabitants, life has often been difficult for Hakan. His parents do not allow him to attend music school. He is not even allowed to go to a music store, because the owners are afraid that he might become addicted to music. And they are the only parents he ever knew who were completely unmusical. As soon as Hakan started playing the trumpet, he became fascinated with the instrument and his teachers. It took a while before Hakan saw a trumpet, but he never considered anything else. Hakan took the trumpet with him when he moved to Vaxjo, so it was always with him, and he has never stopped. If Hakan would have had a trumpet in his hands, the whole world would have been different. When his parents had moved to Vaxjo, Hakan’s father had a guitar and a piano. This is how Hakan learned to play the trumpet. “My dad was a musician,” he says. “My mother was not musical either. At first, she didn’t understand it and didn’t accept me playing in the choir. But she got us on a concert train to Vaxjo and that’s how Hakan started learning to play the trumpet. From the beginning, Hakan had learned from listening to his parents. He loved to study music, but his parents didn’t listen, and he never wanted music at home. One day, Hakan went to a music shop to buy his first trumpet, a small trumpet made of calfskin. His father also took the trumpet, but it didn’t sit well on his knees. “But then I looked at the book “The Trumpet Player.” My dad went to the book to see if it could be played better. He saw the book and fell in love with the trumpet and asked if he could have it. He went to the shop, bought the trumpet and got it out of his hands. He played with a softer mouthpiece and learned the basics, but he kept the trumpet on his head for years, learning new techniques. Hakan began studying with a teacher and a trumpet professor named Carl Börjeson. He is a highly respected trumpet player in the world today and he plays in several bands. Hakan performs with renowned bands and orchestras such as the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, the Stockholm Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic. In a short period, Hakan has achieved great achievements as a player. He has played with orchestras such as the Royal Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. He has recorded several albums, most notably “The Music of Beethoven.” He is a member of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. Today he is one of the most renowned trumpet players in the world. Hakan was given the nickname “the man who played more than anything else in Sweden”, for his dedication, perseverance and perseverance, which made him a role model for other young musicians. There is a well-known song in the swedish language saying “If I hadn’t given up on the dream, my trumpet might not have existed.” This song is actually a song he wrote in memory of his father.","The rssuta trumpet player Hakan Hardenberger, 30, is widely considered the most talented trumpet player in the world. After becoming interested in the instrument in his teens he entered the University of Aarhus, where he graduated in 2010 with the highest degree in music education. Immediately, the trumpeter was captivated by his talent and studied hard. “I was ten when I started, and it wasn’t until I was about 20 that I started playing,” he says. Today, he is a specialist in big band repertoire and plays in an orchestra alongside top musicians from around the world. Hardenberger began his musical journey as an amateur in 1988 when he first saw the band of the Norwegian band “The Borg’s” at a music festival. The band performed two concerts that summer. Hardenberger started taking lessons from his father, and in 1992 he got his first instrument a trumpet. “I started playing in the rssuta trumpet group at the age of five. I was really good then. I was about 10 years old when I started to play and I was pretty good when I joined. The band performed in the same city of Gothenburg, and for the first time I heard the band that played in my hometown in Gothenburg. I started playing. I remember the first performance, which is still something that I remember. I also remember the day that I performed at the concert hall. I was about 11 years old when I started playing a solo. I remember playing my first solo, which was not very good. Then I got to play in the first concert at the age of eight, and then I got to play on stage in the concert. I was 16 years old when I played in the first national and international competitions. I was just 19 when I played in the first international competition in Paris. My parents encouraged me and made sure that I had a good education. My father was a policeman and I was in the military as a fighter pilot. In the winter of 1991 in the Olympic stadium in Los Angeles I was the youngest competitor. Then the year after that I was the youngest participant, again in the Olympic stadium. After that there were two more competitions and in 1996 I competed in a major European music competition. Two years later in the final in Helsinki I finished as the winner. After these first two competitions, there were more. I competed again in the final in Stockholm a year later with my younger brother, but I got eliminated in the final. I was devastated. I had a bad knee. I had my hip replaced. I had to have surgery on my rib cage and I also had an infection from the flu. I could not sleep. I went for a long rest, but my injury was a permanent one. So I took some rest, and it’s been a long time since I played. I’m in great shape now and still play. I am playing with a group called the Swedish Big Band, and I think it is the best big band in the world. I have just played at the European Music Festival with my brothers. We have an exhibition in the orchestra hall where people come to listen to what we play. It is good to see such talent. I think that I must have been in this business for a long time. Aside from my parents, I have three brothers and a sister. I was in this business for a long time. I have to say that the biggest thing for me is that I have a really good mother. I have four siblings and a sister, all of whom have also been in this business. And they also all went through it together. The last time my family went to a music festival was in 2000, when we all went to Stockholm to the international music festival. I remember very well how I stayed in the stage and how nervous I was. I don’t know how it feels that when you become a musician you become a great musician but it can really be tough.","Hakan Hardenberger has an incredibly long list of titles, which you can see at www.hardenberger.com. This list includes:...He is a member of the brass orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera, the Orchestra of the Royal Danish Theatre, and the Royal Danish Academy of Music. He has been named Trumpet Player of the Year by the European Federation of Horn Societies (EfHS), which lists him as one of the 20 most promising young musicians in the world.","Hakan Hardenberger, 30, plays the trumpet, plays with the orchestra and holds the world record for the highest sound-pressure (for any given instrument).

The grounds and grounds are spectacular. The views are stunning, and you can walk for miles as the scenery stretches all the way around. I loved the fact that the spa is housed on a working farm. You can hear the farm animals all the time, and you have the feeling of being part of a local community. They even have a chicken farm. This is the perfect place to sit in the sunshine on a hot summer day. The hotel is a beautiful c19th house in the Lake District, with lots of mature trees and a very modern spa facilities.

A team of five journalists took part in a survey among 500 UK spas. They were looking for a place where guests could experience a full range of spa treatments, including massage, facials, gyms, and swimming pools. In addition to spa facilities, a number of the country houses offered a range of cuisine, including locally-sourced food cooked to order, and breakfast was served in the hotel's grand dining hall. The other four hotels, all based around a historic house, used a combination of high-tech technology, a modern spa and nature to provide relaxation and rejuvenation for their guests.","I was invited to a country house hotel that offers spa facilities to help guests relax and unwind. A lot of the guests are young professionals – or maybe because they are – and they want to unwind and get away from the demands of daily life. Henlow Grange is not far from Milton Keynes and it is a lovely place, set in acres of manicured gardens, woodland, grazing, and a river that runs through it. There are pools, saunas, steam rooms, a steam room, saunas, a snooker table, a ten-minute walk to the river, and a great location for a walk in the woods and gardens. The food is excellent, and the staff incredibly welcoming. There are three spas at Henlow Grange, a Swedish sauna, a hammam, a Finnish sauna, a traditional Turkish bath, a sauna and a Turkish bath. One of the spas offers a hydrotherapy pool which is open all day and evening. There is also a gym, spa treatments and saunas. When I arrived, I was met by an employee from Henlow Grange who told me a bit about the hotel. After the usual check in and introductions, I was given a room in which to take a bath, where I had a robe and slippers provided. After showering, I was led into a lounge where I found two armchairs and a couch. After a while, I saw a small table with two chairs and a couple of buckets, and then was shown round to the hammam. After bathing, I lay down on the couch with a towel over my head and a hot drink in my hand. After the hammam, I sat in a chair on the grass. The hammam is a large round pool, and in the hammam I could feel some sea water. It was very relaxing. There were a few treatments and I could choose between a Thai massage, sauna, shave, aromatherapy, hydrotherapy, and a full face mask. I chose a facial. A facial costs £32.50. There is a small charge for this. They even offer a men's facial. For £60, I got an aromatherapy facial, which included a hot bath, a deep massage, a warm compress, a facial mask, a light facial with a steam bath and a massage. After the facial, I relaxed in a hydrotherapy pool, sat on an outdoor massage chair, and enjoyed a glass of prosecco. I then chilled in a floatation pool and took a dip in the water. It was amazing how deep the water was. After the shower, I spent a good amount of time relaxing with a hot bath. I was very glad I went for a swim because I spent all afternoon enjoying the pool. After we were all together, we went for a walk in the woods. I felt so relaxed at the end that when I woke, I wanted to run after my children. My daughter walked around the lake, jumped into the stream and then got into the water with my husband. It was lovely, especially as I had just finished my day's work. Another time, I had a cup of tea and a muffin before I got into the shower. I was able to take a shower in the evening.","IF YOU WANT TO WIND DOWN, GET A RELAXATION OR JUST RELAX, THESE FARMS AND COUNTRY HOUSES OFFER SPA FACILITIES. At Grange Farm near St Neots, Suffolk, we had a week full of therapies, treatments and fun. The staff made sure we took in the countryside and went on nature walks. As we did so, the farm itself grew in popularity. ""Retreat RELAX RECHARGE"" is what I wrote about the Grange Farm. The farm offers a variety of facilities from a wide range of therapies to activities such as yoga and horticulture, and the whole property has a natural theme. It's one of the nicest retreats I've been to so far. A few of the features on my visit included the beautiful garden and the enticing herb garden. I even saw red squirrels and other wildlife. The garden is lovely and peaceful. I enjoyed the food, too: it's healthy and home-cooked, cooked with local ingredients. The cottages are spacious and light with some good views. The en suite rooms were excellent. I stayed in a double room, which had a walk-in shower and bath. The room had a comfortable bed and had plenty of lighting and socket sockets. The cottages are decorated nicely. The food was decent although not very good. I enjoyed the meals and the setting of the spa area. One of the best features of the spa area was the steam room. It was a fantastic experience. After using the steam room, I was asked to lie back on a steam room bed. I couldn't wait to get up again and use the facilities in the steam room. I used the steam room for a long time and enjoyed it. The steam room was one of my favourites. During a long, relaxing afternoon, I sipped a drink in the steam room before having a treatment. It was very relaxing and very relaxing. There are steam rooms in several hotels now. To get a sense of the atmosphere at each hotel, I went to the Spa Village website. The spa village has lots of information on everything from massages to facials and a spa village map with all the information. To read about more of the UK's country houses and spas and to find a hotel near you, see CountryHouseHotels.com. The farm in Henlow near St Neots, Suffolk is part of a large country estate which also includes its own spa and golf course. The garden has trees, grass and bushes that help to cool down the body. I enjoyed the massage room, which has different levels of pressure so that you can relax or get very tense.","If you're looking to find a way to recharge and relax after a hectic work schedule, try a holiday at a health farm. The countryside is far away from any traffic, and the farms are often set on rural land. They are a great way to get away from daily stresses and help you to get back to shape. For instance, I stayed at Henlow Grange, an all-weather-camping retreat where I could be left to my own devices in a field, and enjoy the natural surroundings. B. WHISPERING HALL I stayed at Whispering Hall for the first time on Thursday, where I spent the first five days of a wellness break, before being invited in for dinner on a Friday. There was a bit of a buzz around the building from the moment I arrived. There were some fun activities on offer at this luxurious country hotel, such as a petting zoo. My favourite part of the hotel was the pool, which has three pools, a whirlpool and separate toddler pool. Some of the water was cold, but there were hot baths and jets that were warm and the water was pretty cool. We were able to swim, and the whirlpool tub was the perfect temperature. There was also a naturist area with a sauna and steam room, which is a popular option with visitors. At one point, we came down to the lake for a swim, which was very refreshing. Afterwards, it was time to get pampered with the in-house spa, which included a gym, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi, and a relaxation room. For a few hours, we were left alone to do what we wanted; for example, we sipped herbal tea, watched a film or just laid around on a lounger. During the day, we visited the health farm's retail shop where we saw a range of skincare and hair care products. It was a very relaxing day, even though we spent a few hours in front of the laptop. B. SINTON GARDENS At this wonderful spa in Somerset, I was treated to a heavenly experience. The whole village seemed to be in holiday mode as I came across a range of shops selling everything from healthy food to quirky accessories. There were lots of things to look at, but the centrepiece of the spa was a glass-bottomed pool and a spa sauna. When we arrived, there was a live pianist playing classical music, making it all so relaxing. The spa was also home to a theatre, so we decided to watch a comedy called The Man Who Had Everything. I have never seen comedy like this in my life. C. BLESSINGBOX I went to blissbox for two days while I was there on Thursday. I was welcomed by the spa's head chef, Tom Hallett, who kindly gave me a tour around the spa. On the first day, I learned that it was a unique day spa based on a Victorian mansion in Birmingham. When we arrived, there was a drinks reception and we sat down for our first meal, which was a delicious smoked salmon burger. The rest of the day was spent afloat in the spa pool, listening to a soothing music playlist, and re-fueling from a delicious two-course evening meal. I really enjoyed that. The food was superb. After lunch, we got pampered with a massage. If you have a busy workload, why not try a spa break away from the office? It was an excellent way for me to relax and recharge, and I really enjoyed it. I could not recommend it enough. 4. LYNDBOURNE CHAPEL I liked Lyndbourn because it is in the middle of a lovely countryside, a great place for walks and a stroll around the local market. Lyndbourn was very relaxing, and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. We ate in the café and bar, which was very stylish, with a great view over the surrounding countryside. I felt very relaxed, and I didn't want to leave. 5. LYNDMORSE HALLETON This lovely spa is in the grounds of Lyndbourne Hallett, a very popular country house hotel, which has been in business for over 130 years. It is situated on the edge of a forest, close to a river, and has wonderful views over the countryside.

There is also a large swimming pool, a Turkish bath, a Finnish sauna and an ice bath. All have views of the gardens and nearby countryside. The rooms are tastefully decorated and have en suite bathrooms with showers and a hairdryer. The facilities also have a tv, mini bar and free wi-fi. After a day in the beautiful gardens and swimming pool, I took a stroll through the woods and discovered a waterfall. I also visited the spa and the YWCA in nearby Berkhamsted. 2. LYDNEY OLD BANK They have a thriving spa industry, with regular guests including Queen Elizabeth, Princess Anne and Princess Beatrice. Guests who want to try their hand at massage are also welcome. 3. ROBINSTOWN COUNTRY HOUSE This is a large country house hotel and spa offering a number of different treatment options, from acupuncture to yoga.

It is situated on a farm in Norfolk and offers free wi-fi. 5. BURTON HEAVENS BRAZEN GARDENS I couldn't believe my eyes when I arrived at this beautiful country house hotel, where I was shown my room and showered before arriving at dinner. I was shocked and excited. This is really my kind of place. 6. LITTLE BIRD MANOR It is a quaint family house hotel in a village in Hampshire with a pretty outdoor heated swimming pool. I loved the fact that there is a duck pond, and a large garden full of plants to help relax. 7. VANDERBIJL HOUSE This is a beautiful hotel in Belgium that has a swimming pool, a gym, a spa and a restaurant. 8. SUGAR PARK ESTATE They had many facilities to help you relax, and a great outdoor swimming pool. 9. SNOW PARK ESTATE I love all the things I can do at the Snow Park Resort. A good example is their gym. I like to exercise a bit to keep myself fit, which is why I love this place. 10. WALKING HEIGHTS If you want to exercise, walk over this hill. The views from the top are great. 11. CREW HISTORICAL HOUSE This beautiful hotel is located in the heart of Suffolk. There is lots to see and do here, including an indoor heated swimming pool, a sauna, steam room and sauna. 12. WOOD RIVER FARM I was a little surprised by the cleanliness of this hotel. I had heard good things about the spa and treatment facilities at the nearby country house hotels. 14. BELLINGHAM HEAVEN I am not a very fit person. I thought I would have a good workout at this hotel. But when I got here, I found that I was too tired and achy to do anything. 15. THE HEALTH TRAILS HOUSE I was a bit unsure of how to tackle this hotel, as I didn't know where to stay. But after a morning of walking and swimming, I was excited to get on with it. 16. WALLEY HEIGHTS RESORT I loved the design of this hotel and it had a beautiful garden with a fountain. 17. HARLESDEN BAY HOTEL The hotel has a good indoor pool, a sauna and a steam room. I loved the whirlpool bath in the bath. 18. HERBAL OAKS A place to enjoy a massage by a registered massage therapist, plus a pool. 19.

THE HEAVEN ESTATES I love the","Henlow Grange, which is in Lincolnshire, a stunning Grade II listed building, sits on three acres of land and is a working farm. Its aim is to ""help people to look after themselves"" and ""to restore vitality"". I was shown around the property and given a tour of the kitchens and bedrooms. The first thing I noticed was the large glass windows and views across a field towards Lincoln. I noticed also that the hotel had a restaurant on site. As the menu suggested there is a lot on offer at the hotel including, on the menu, 'Bounty', which you get by taking part in a daily challenge. The second thing I noticed was that the spa facility offered a number of treatments such as reflexology and beauty treatments, which I was interested in trying. I started my treatment with 'The Balancing Ritual' which is a full body massage using acupressure points. I felt relaxed all over and was amazed at how much energy I had. After the treatment I continued with the 'Bone Shiatsu'. In the evening I started my treatment with 'The Relaxing Ritual' where a trained masseur uses soft touch massage techniques to relax you. The third treatment that I tried was the 'Rejuvenating Baths'. As well as a relaxing bath in the whirlpool bath it included some very relaxing and soothing sounds, which you can tuck into the ears and snooze on. The next day I took part in the 'Foot Revitalisation' where I had a full body massage using a hot stoner. It included a full body massage as well as a foot massage. The day ended with a massage in the 'Massage Theatre'. The massage was fantastic - and it made my legs feel great! I was given some lovely gifts on my return home."
C1,"He spoke for a short while and then he walked away. Charles could have gone to Rouen alone if he thought that he would be interrupted by Emma, who he knew was very worried about Charles. He didn’t. Emma was not upset by his departure and she could tell him that it was time for him to find other occupations. However, he told her that as he had hoped Emma would make more progress in her studies. Emma sighed and said that he would not be disturbed by Charles’s departure. She was going to Rouen to meet Louisa, and he could come with her on the same train as she.","Charles smiled gently. ""Yes, I could take the whole day to explain myself to him, but it would be difficult because he is a gentleman,"" he said. ""You must wait until it is light enough."" ""Not yet,"" said Emma. She was thinking of things to say. She was also thinking of the fact that it was too late to have a conversation with him, but she was anxious not to let him get offended if she were to explain herself. ""What if he was angry?"" she asked. ""It was very easy to be angry with a man when he is being a gentleman."" Charles could see that Emma was hesitating. ""But that was not my fault,"" he said. ""I think I told him the truth."" ""That does not make a difference to your matter. If you are not quite sure it is true—and I have said it—I will let you know. I will do what I can and I will not worry you."" ""But if he is angry at me, I will let him know."" She thought for a moment. ""That was not a word Charles uttered; but he was not. He was so polite."" ""He was not even sorry. He was so well mannered. I doubt if he had known."" He looked over his shoulder. ""I suppose I am in the right place; it is good to see you, I hope."" ""How should I know?"" he asked. ""It is easy to tell people their opinion of you if you are so pleasant."" ""That is not a good way to express your opinion,"" said Charles. ""I must say, I am very glad to hear it."" ""The truth is that I am sure it is true. It is one of the reasons I came to England. I am sure it is true. I am sure you are. I hope you are.""","Charles rubbed his arms. He felt that she would lose. She offered him a small smile, which he accepted and said he would go on. He had given his word and he did not wish to meet her. She said he could not. He had been so insistent on her going, and this could be a victory for her. Charles was astonished that she would even flinch. She wanted to be brave; he was a coward. Nonetheless, he would not go. He could not refuse her. Emma turned to look at him with a sad look. Charles was now angry. She would not hear of him bothering her. She wanted the letter to reach her. But he had given up hope of seeing her before she left. “I do not think he has any intention of going over,” she said. “I have no intention of that. I would rather he not go over.” He was looking towards the road to the train station. But when he turned the corner and saw Emma, he felt as though he was in danger. Emma turned to leave but he turned back.","Emma said, 'Well then, I will go over and speak to him.' Charles said, 'I don't have the courage and I cannot make an effort. Is it only you who want to go?'. She said, 'Yes, but I feel like asking you to do it.' Charles said, 'You are right, and you cannot make an effort.' Emma nodded, 'Yes, that is what I said.' And he walked out the door.","Charles tried to say that Emma had a habit of writing sarcastic letters, but his tone was not so amused as his tone made out. In fact, Emma sounded so depressed at the thought of Charles saying that she was 'not at home today'. When she suggested this, Charles admitted that he had a habit of saying things that made her feel ill. He also admitted that he genuinely did not understand that Emma was very unhappy. He said that in order to explain things better, he needed to write more sarcastic letters. He explained that he was writing to Emma to ask her to move to the city where her parents lived because it would be easier for him. Emma said that she thought that he was trying to 'trouble her.' It was a battle of kindness against annoyance. He agreed that she could go over to Rouen and talk to him directly. He walked back up to Emma and said, 'She is not at home.' Then he went back to Charles and said, 'Do you really want to go?' 'She does not want to go,' Charles said. Emma nodded and said 'I will go.' When he had left, he said, 'Don't worry, I will bring her somewhere,' and the housekeeper answered and carried Emma back to the door. They entered the kitchen and Emma sat down on the stairs, then said, 'Would it be difficult to explain matters by letter?' Charles replied, 'Yes, but I have already said that. I will speak to you later.'",Charles had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say. Now she could suggest that it was difficult to explain matters by letter and she offered to go over to Rouen and speak to him directly. Charles would not hear of troubling her. She insisted. It was a battle of kindness.,He had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say.

We had to ask our boss for a better solution because we had been made to do a lot of things wrong. But now we no longer have to do that and we can have more fun. I would like to give some advice to other people about how to improve their work life. The first is to always try to be yourself. The second is to always show your true personality so that your boss can like you. The third is to never show your weakness at work because this will damage your chances of getting a job. The last is to always follow your heart.","Career power means bringing a little bit of yourself to your job. It can sometimes feel like you just can't keep up with what your boss asks you to do or to do well. The key is to think ahead and to always push yourself to the next level. The best way to do that is to make sure you have the right skills, so that you can do your best every day. Take the time to read about leadership styles, including both those you admire, and those who fail to inspire you. It is important to read about people who you respect and admire, especially those who have worked hard to get where they are.

The study reveals that people are not judging us by how clever we are anymore, but by how well we handle ourselves and others. ""There are a few kinds of people skills that we still need to learn, but we don't need to learn how to be a super-loyal customer to be competitive in any business.""","In an article in The Economist, Daniel Goleman examines how emotion has become the new yardstick to measure success in work. Goleman finds that people who can 'understand people' are more successful than those who can't, and says that the 'doing' - such as being a good listener or motivator - is more important than the 'knowing' and is the new'soft' skill needed for success.","'Emotional intelligence' is a term often used to refer to someone's ability to handle their emotions and how they manage their energy. Daniel Goleman says it has become one of the most powerful predictors of success. 'It is a skill that has to do with how we react emotionally and understand and control the emotions of other people. 'For more than 30 years, successful people have used it as a stepping stone to their success. Goleman says it is a skill that is becoming increasingly difficult to develop.","Daniel Goleman describes how we have been being judged by a new yardstick. A new book on emotional intelligence titled The Talent Code is out today. Goleman is one of the most widely read authors on the subject, a Harvard Business School professor and the co-author of the bestseller ""The Talent Code"" (see here and here). In this short article, he describes his research on ""the four pillars of emotional intelligence"". Emotional intelligence is simply how we perceive and respond to emotion. We use emotions to understand the people around us, to solve problems and to make decisions. Emotional intelligence is a combination of two areas: emotional empathy and social recognition. Social recognition involves the ability to pick up on subtle cues – subtle cues about the body language, facial expressions, gestures and mannerisms of others. This can then be used to build and maintain effective relationships. Social recognition is particularly important in organizations, where social skills are required to effectively deal with conflict. So, if you are in a team, where your job is to interact with the people in your team, you must be able to recognize subtle cues about how to respond when a colleague misbehaves. For many, this ability to recognize and react to subtle cues is a crucial skill that can make or break a team. However, for some, this skill may actually be the most important part of their job. A survey showed that the two main areas people tend to score low on are emotional sensitivity and social awareness. The more people score low on social awareness the more they need to focus on improving their emotional intelligence. So, if we are able to understand how other people think and how we can influence and change the way people feel about something, then our interactions can lead to greater workplace success. Having high emotional intelligence is a critical skill, particularly if you are an athlete. You must be able to understand the needs of others to win a race. If you do not understand the needs and objectives of others, then it is very difficult to win. Therefore, if you want to win, you must also work on improving your emotional intelligence. It is now considered one of the key factors in professional success, as Goleman has shown in The Talent Code. How do you measure up against the requirements? Firstly, you need to identify your strengths and weaknesses. Next, you need to know what people in your work environment expect from you. Secondly, you need to think about how you can do your best to get people to do their best. Thirdly, you need to figure out what people like and don't like and why. By measuring your emotional intelligence, you will get a clear idea of what type of people work well together in your field and who won't. It can be used as an indicator of whether you are a good leader, communicator and team member. The answer will influence the kinds of jobs available for you and your ability to manage conflict in your workplace. The book is available from all good bookshops.","During a research project in the 1960s, a Nobel Prize winner called Daniel Goleman asked several experts to provide their opinions on what he would call emotional intelligence. Goleman concluded that if you could improve the way you interact with other people, you'd be a more successful professional. That same person was also called the ""Handshake King"" for the ability to handle a difficult situation. The research revealed that if a person has good emotional intelligence, they can handle difficult situations without escalating the issue. A person can handle a tough situation without getting upset because they have emotional intelligence. A person who does not have good emotional intelligence gets frustrated quickly or upset easily, whereas a person who has good emotional intelligence can take time to respond to what is asked of them. ""Everyone has some level of emotional intelligence,"" says Goleman. ""No, it's not just how clever you are, how good you are at math, how good you are at writing, how well you can drive a car."" (Goleman's book) Goleman also found that individuals with high emotional intelligence are less stressed at work because they are well-adjusted to their environment. He found that people who had high emotional intelligence were more likely to be successful with people in other careers. (Goleman's book) Goleman says that the most important emotional intelligence skill is self-awareness. Self-awareness is about being aware of your emotions and feelings, but it's also a sense of self that helps you know when to express yourself and when to suppress those feelings.","Emotional intelligence is a term that has only recently found its way into mainstream English language usage. A few years ago, the New York Times wrote a very interesting article on Emotional intelligence. They also described a range of personality traits as a way of expressing a person's inclinations, and identifying the qualities that are desirable. Today, Emotional Intelligence is a coveted title in business and professional life. As many as one-third of American workers are said to be over-stressed, with one in five reported to have feelings of anxiety or depression. In the book 'The Emotional Intelligence Advantage' written by Daniel Goleman, a professor of psychology at Stanford University, Goleman investigates how the 'people skills' of managers and businesspeople can be measured and how they can influence a company's success. Goleman explains how to develop people skills, and how managers can recognise when they aren't working, and what they should do about it. 1. Daniel Goleman was a psychology professor at Stanford University. He was also a psychologist who specialized in studying intelligence. Goleman first studied psychology at Yale University, where he received his bachelor's degree in psychology, before moving to Stanford for graduate study. His first book, The Emotional Intelligence Advantage: How Smart People Get the Stuff They Want, and How Smart People Underperform, was published in 2001. 2. Goleman wrote The Emotional Intelligence Advantage: How Smart People Get the Stuff They Want, and How Smart People Underperform, which went on to become an international bestseller. 3. Daniel Goleman has worked for the past 15 years on personality issues, focusing on a variety of research methods to study them. He is the director of the Leadership and Management Program at Harvard Business School. 4. Goleman believes that we can develop our emotional intelligence by learning the skills that others demonstrate when they are in crisis, such as empathy and nonverbal communication."

C1,"Getting up early is good for you. So it's the perfect reason to invest in a high quality clock radio. But what's a good clock radio? The simplest way to understand what to buy for your new clock radio is to look at it through the eyes of a pro. According to Harris, a research director at the company Sonos, a consumer electronics company, there are two main aspects: aesthetics and functionality. A good clock radio uses a lot of'refreshing design', with an attractively-designed exterior and a soft touch panel that allows you to control the light. The clock has to wake the user, who will then have to follow a clear process. As soon as they put the radio in the room, it takes around three minutes to set the tone and start up the alarm. Harris says that once the set point is reached, the clock gets louder and louder, making it impossible to fall back to sleep. It has an on/off switch for the power, and the light will keep on working. The clock itself is relatively expensive, coming in at about $320 (£195). The downside, though, is that it doesn't sound like a regular radio. The alarm can be a little quiet.","The Alarm clock radio has become a rage among consumers across the world, and the problem that goes with buying one is the vast selection available on the market. If you are looking for an alarm clock radio, you probably will need a bit more than just the price – and probably want one that provides more features than just the alarm and sounds. One way that you can get more features from your alarm clock radio is to get an alarm clock with an external speaker. You will be able to hear everything the radio is playing in real time or you can have it set to some a random background song. Some alarm clocks come with a small speaker attached to the side of the radio. These speakers are designed to make your alarm sound like a music player. When your alarm goes off, the speaker will play the music you picked out on the radio. If you are looking for the best alarm clock radio, you need to pick a speaker with a loud speaker. If you like quiet music, go for a speaker that has a low sound level. If you are looking for a more aural experience, choose a speaker that doesn’t have any vibration or squeaks. You need speakers that can offer different types of sounds. An alarm clock radio has a speaker inside the radio that will usually have a bass-reflex design. Bass-reflex designs usually offer more depth and bass than concave designs. Some speakers will have a dome-shaped design that is molded into the front of the radio and designed to provide a wide listening space. The best speakers will have a dome-shaped design that is molded into the front of the radio. You will need to pick a speaker that sounds like a radio to get the best audio experience. The louder the speaker, the better the sound quality. There are two kinds of speakers used on alarm clock radios: ceramic or metal. Ceramic speakers are usually very loud and have a very deep bass. Metal speakers are usually brighter but don’t tend to offer the bass response of ceramic speakers. Ceramic speakers are slightly more expensive than metal speakers. This is because of their construction. It takes a very high quality radio to create a high-quality sound. Also, a ceramic speaker will work better when it is placed on the floor and on its sides. Metal speakers work well in a tabletop position because they are able to project sound across a distance. Metal speakers are not always in the best position for sound quality because the metal can easily absorb sound. Metal speakers are also very common in small rooms. You can place a metal speaker in the middle of a room to add an effect of depth. When you want to be woken up, you will need to have a good quality clock radio. Look for one that has a crystal that doesn’t shatter easily if it is dropped on a hard surface, like a carpet. Some crystal clock radios are also designed to rotate so that they can wake you up if they detect any obstructions between you and the radio. The clock radio with a crystal on it will also be more accurate since it won’t lose power, unlike other clock radios. Some of these clock radios can be easily controlled with your smartphone. You will need an app to install it on your phone. Some clock radios may have an internal speaker, but only if it is used with a Bluetooth device. A speaker that isn’t used with Bluetooth is a bit pricey. There are many clock radios out there for different budgets, but it can be very expensive. You can easily spend $50 or more on a clock radio. You will also need to set the time of day that you want your radio to wake up. Some clock radios have an LCD screen that can display your name or a message. Others do not have a display screen and are very expensive. If you want an alarm clock radio that is both affordable and good looking, look for a speaker with a large sound. This will not only provide great sound quality, but it may have better battery life and you will be much less likely to have to buy a brand new one every few years. However, you will also need to be comfortable with having a speaker in the room where you want it. You can also consider getting a clock radio with a speaker. Usually, a speaker with a decent sound quality will do just as well as a clock radio with a lack of sound quality. Ultimately, it is up to your preferences.","How do you pick a good clock radio? Stuart Harris writes that getting up to listen to the radio isn’t easy, especially if you’re a morning person. The majority of the time you end up listening to the radio all by yourself (the only exception being when you’re waking up early for a trip). You may also have a tendency to listen to the radio while you are getting dressed, while in a meeting or while you’re reading in bed. The following are some suggestions for how you can pick a good clock radio for you and your family: Some clock radios have built-in FM radio, others will connect to a speaker that is built into the clock. Others will plug directly into your TV or into your phone to provide the FM radio experience. Others will be connected to the Internet. Often you’ll get one that is already set up for the radio and you may also be able to buy it online. Others will come with extras, such as the speaker. Those that have the speaker will tend to be a bit louder. Try to get the volume at a level where you’re able to hear clearly and quickly. If you haven’t got a loud enough room in your bedroom you may need to get a speaker in there instead. Many clock radios have music or speech on the radio. You will also need to pick a radio that has a speaker built into it. Sometimes they come with built-in speakers, which will allow you to listen to music and podcasts at the same time. Others come with remote controls. These aren’t the best choice for families with small children who might want to listen to the radio, but they can make it easier for them. If you want to listen to a radio in the car, make sure that you have a car-adapter, as you will need to get this in order to play the music on your phone. Most have a mute button that lets you listen to the radio at a lower volume. Other models will wake you up when it’s time to get out of bed. You may also need to turn on the radio. It’s important that you turn your clock radio on so that it’s ready to hear music when you need to get up. Your alarm clock will tell you what time it’s going to be so you can get up and get ready. This is usually done by turning the radio volume up or down. This will also usually give you an extra 20 seconds or so of sleep. To find out how loud your alarm clock is you will need to listen to it while you are in bed. During this time the radio volume will gradually increase. Most clock radios will make the most noise when you are in bed. Your alarm clock is usually made of some sort of material, and you will probably also need to pick up a remote control to turn the radio up or down or change the volume. This might be an additional wired accessory which goes into your bedroom to control the radio. A cordless radio will often need the use of a power adapter which means more money at the end of the month. If you have to plug the clock radio into a power outlet you might need to take out the plug from your TV or the wall socket to get the radio to work. If you have the cash you can buy a stand for your clock radio. If you do not have the cash or you want to keep a separate radio and TV you can usually find a radio speaker in a kitchen or somewhere else in your house. However if your ceiling or walls are not flat it is advisable to keep the radio in your bedroom at a higher volume. Your radio speaker will most likely be an extension of the ceiling and may not provide the right quality for you. However if you are in the bedroom you should be able to hear the radio even in the most difficult of situations. To use your phone in the bedside table you will need a charger. It is a good idea to buy the charger when you have it with you, but you should also take a look at where the charger can be found in your home. As you have probably noticed, you will hear different stations depending on where you are in the house. This can make it difficult to listen to the different stations without having to walk down and plug them in. In the office you may need a wall speaker if you want to listen to music at the same time. Finally you may need the clock radio to wake you up, in which case you may need one with an alarm function. There are lots of clock radio options to choose from. Most are battery operated – you do not have to press a button to turn it on.","One thing you shouldn't do if you buy a clock radio is go out and buy it for the bathroom. As the saying goes, the best alarm clock is the one which is in the bathroom! And when Stuart Harris was choosing the best alarm clock for his bedroom, he decided that he wanted a clock radio for a second bathroom. He set a radio up and played a song from the playlist and set the alarm clock. It made the alarm sound just perfect.","Some people listen to music when they get up in the morning, while others simply set their alarm, read the morning paper or surf the web. Which do you prefer? Why? Read on! How does Stuart Harris pick his clock radio? Stuart Harris: The alarm clock is something that everyone buys. It is something we listen to every day, whether we are in a house or an apartment. We have a radio on which we hear our favorite shows, radio news, and classical music, whether it is in the morning or in the evening. What is your favorite kind of alarm clock? It's a very personal thing, but I like music when I get up in the morning. A lot of people like classical music, so I decided to look into some new classical music. What do you listen to when you get up in the morning? Stuart Harris: As soon as I hear music, usually classical music, my brain is alert and I get out of bed. I usually don't want it to be loud, because that gets the noise into my ears and blocks my hearing. I have a Sony Xperia Z6 alarm clock radio, and I like it, because it has a nice look to it. I like a wide screen and it has a very bright display, so I see what I am looking at clearly. It has a very soft glow, so it won't interfere with my sleep. What do you like about your Sony clock radio? Stuart Harris: What is the last thing you listen to before you go to bed? Stuart Harris: There are plenty of music on there, even though there are so many commercials! What would be your favorite songs from them? Stuart Harris: There are many, many people, so if you are looking for a classic kind of music, I recommend you to get a Sony, because they make very nice ones. How do you know which clock radio to buy? Stuart Harris: First of all, think about what kind of music you like the most. Are you more likely to listen to classical music or does rock or metal music arouse you more? Stuart Harris: I just like a wide range of music, I think that's why I like them all, but I tend to choose the one that is the cheapest, because it's nice and it's easy to change the station. What would you like to know before buying?","It was the night before a major hurricane struck Texas. The radio tuned into a news program reporting the news. The news report came at 6:20 p.m. Luckily, not many people were injured and none of the people suffered any injuries. As the reporter waited for his incoming message to come in, we heard thunder rolling in the distance. When he took the radio off of his stand, it sounded the alarm. The radio was so loud that we were able to hear the waves as it moved over us. After ten minutes of loud and continuous thunder, we were still asleep. It was then that we realized we were in a life-threatening situation. The radio was so loud that we couldn't hear the message coming through the walls of the building. Our alarm had started beeping in our ears, but there were no sounds coming from the phone or from the TV. When we turned the radio on, we heard the sound of the wind. A few minutes after that, the sound of the screams of the dying gulls stopped. We all got up from bed and headed to the kitchen. We realized that we had not done anything to prevent the gulls from going away. It was now time to prepare for the day. We had to look at all of our choices for a clock radio. We looked at a wide range of styles. We looked at some of the most popular types in the world. We also looked at the price range of the various models. We learned that even small children are able to understand the message being broadcast.","The mornings can sometimes be a bit difficult. It can be hard to get out of bed or you just can't. That's where a clock radio can help. They can take the place of the alarm clock you rely on to get you out of bed. A clock radio can wake you up with a loud tune - or at least the right time. When choosing a clock radio for yourself, consider the following. First off, listen to the selection and choose the music that best suits you. You can also get audiobooks, which can be a great help if you are a day or night person or if you want to wake up with some good motivational talk. Then, try a radio with a built-in alarm which sounds the appropriate tone. It is important that you can pick a radio that is functional. An alarm clock that works may be able to wake you up while you are still dreaming, but it may not be a very good option if you are going to be using it all day. You might want a clock radio that you can use to get into bed later, but be aware that if the alarm is loud, you will have trouble getting up and getting dressed. It is best to choose a clock radio that will be there to wake you up if it is going to wake you up."
C1,"A PUBLIC lecture by Jonallum Porritt, which has been adapted by Danny Danziger, looks at our current climate. Porritt is an author and researcher and in the future will write books about the politics of ecology. Porritt has been a political activist in New Zealand since he was 12. He studied at the University of Waikato and the National University of New Zealand. He also studied at The Institute of Management in Chicago. When he was 24, Porritt came to Australia to do his PhD and wrote a book about New Zealand ecology. During that time, he got sucked into the global climate change debate. He then worked for a number of years in the environmental movement and was soon appointed deputy director of WWF Australia and New Zealand. Then in 2009, Porritt became the director of Greenpeace Australia. He has been described as a “global green activist”.","I WAS in New Zealand for a very special time: the Summer of ‘86. I was an intern in the National Forest Service, and I walked out with a map of the forest of Wanaka. I planted a stake in the ground. It was a simple little thing that was a declaration of war on the pests of the land. After all, we were still on the doorstep of the Industrial Revolution in New Zealand. The world was in crisis. I had to go back home. To the place of the first winter in the 20th century, when New Zealand was a very different nation from the one I was in at the time. I saw the land a thousand different ways. And it wasn’t pretty. So when I got home, I went to my garden to plant some flowers. And I looked out of the window. And it looked like hell. I came back to the tree. And I turned to the trees. They had made a good show of being a perfect target. There were no hummingbirds or butterflies. And there were no pigeons or stoats in the garden. It had been a glorious summer. And then, when I went back to my apartment, it was still freezing cold. I’d been cold since I got there, so I turned on the heater and turned it on. And I turned on my air-conditioning. And I went back to bed. And I thought, I’m still cold. This is a stupid thing to do. It’s like you’re on an island and it’s winter. So why do we do it? It’s not like it’s an emergency. It’s not like we need to do anything. It’s only as long as we need to. So, it was the worst winter ever. I woke in the morning to a shiver. And it felt like a savage chill was going through my body. And I started to wake up. That was the first time I knew I was cold. Then, I saw this guy. He was like, “What do you do?” My heart sank. He was the same size as me, but he was white. So, I gathered the courage to look up into the sky. And a white streak shot across my brain. It was a white feather. And I remembered where that came from. I was going to see it. So I walked into my office. And it had a white feather on it. It was Jonallum Porritt. Jonallum Porritt (born 1972) is an environmental activist and writer living in New Zealand.","My father and I were very, very young. We were just two years old, and we were sitting on our front lawn, playing football with our neighbours. We had no car, or telephone. We lived on a ten acre block on the outskirts of North Sydney, which is now a suburb. My father had moved there when he was four. We came down from Sydney when he was twelve or thirteen, and the kids had grown up. I would get a telephone call from my eldest sister, who I was a football fan. I had not been in touch with my mother for years. This isn’t a story a lot of people know. It is a story about my father’s life, about his coming to the UK as an orphan to make it on his own. I wasn’t a football fan. In fact, I wasn’t even into football. I remember seeing on the radio that John Caulfield was playing for an England football team. I’d just returned from a match when John had come up on the radio, and I said I was very happy to see him. At the time I’d never seen him before, and I’d never played football. When I rang the number he was on the other end of the country and he was sitting on the beach, watching the sea. That summer, my father had been very ill, and we had no children. His doctor had told us that he was not well, and I was convinced that he was suffering from diabetes. I was with him the whole time and on that summer he died, so my mum was just being very, very ill. It was very hard to think about anything in the summer, because the sun was always in the back of our minds. My dad told me that there was some way of escaping the pain of being sick. I did a few things, but the biggest was that I went to see The Goonies, and we just wanted to sit out in the gardens, and the sun came out, and we sat in the garden looking at the trees, and talking to the kids, and watching them grow up. If they had had a vegetable patch on their back, they would have made their own vegetables from all the vegetables they grew in. We used to make these veggie salads. The tomatoes, tomatoes, onions, all the things were growing in the garden. As we sat out there and looked at all these nifty little things, I thought ‘that’s exactly what we need to grow in New Zealand – healthy foods that are actually worth eating,’ and the tomatoes began to grow. Soon we realised that we were just growing our own vegetables. All these things were growing in an amazing way, the tomatoes were full of nutrients. My dad, who was sick and had cancer, was in the hospital, I remember, waiting for the operation and all the plastics coming out of his body. My mother would cry. I remember the day when John Caulfield died. I don’t remember the details because I was too young. That particular day, I remember being in hospital with a brain haemorrhage from a very traumatic brain injury. My parents took me into an intensive care unit. I remember my mum crying at that point. My dad could feel her heart beat rising – it was like a big, beautiful balloon. And when I found out he was suffering, I couldn’t help thinking that he would die – he didn’t. I remember reading that there was a connection between children’s health and the environment. And I remember telling my mother that I loved her. I remember writing that my mum’s mum would one day die of cancer, which I did. It was a very, very difficult time, not just for me, but for my whole family as well. It didn’t help that my mother was very poor, not just financially, but in terms of her own mental health. So we didn’t have the opportunity to see her too often. I remember that we had a lot of talk about the environment during our summers at school. And then the summers at home were pretty miserable too, with loads of rain and no sunshine. We didn’t go away, or spend time playing. We didn’t go to the shops, or watch our family having fun. So my life as a child was spent in all these ways. I remember, for example, my dad always taking us to a local farm that his mother owned. On one of these family farms, a",You have a very nice stake to plant in New Zealand. You have a nice stake in the sand that you used for digging up the ground in India.,"After being born in Sydney, Australia, Jonallum Porritt moved to the Scottish Highlands in 1986. Born at Glasgow’s Royal Botanic Gardens and raised in the Scottish Highlands, he studied law at Edinburgh and was awarded the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship. He then taught law at the University of Northumbria, Scotland. He has since taught at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Dundee. He is now a practising barrister in Dundee, Scotland. He argues that there is little connection between climate change and the growth of society. He is an ardent believer in living a more sustainable life. He spoke to Danny Dannziger about the politics of the environment in his new book, Seeing Green: The Politics of Ecology.","I BELIEVE it is because I spent an unremitting year walking the countryside and observing how people lived, not just in London, but everywhere else. One day I realised there was more to life than city life. I wanted to be a part of nature. We had all seen photos of nature being consumed by the forces of man. That led me to explore how humans had caused so much of the destruction. How we could end the destruction? We could stop human interference and start living more in harmony with nature. I was so enlightened, I bought my mother a tree. I called it my Stake. I looked for a tree in Britain. The spruce would become my first Stake. This was just the beginning. The tree I planted was a Stake that will spread seeds of change. I was also interested in tree politics because the environment was a part of the fight for human rights. I am committed to defending that right. I had an unremitting year of walking the countryside and observing how people lived, not just in London, but everywhere else. But that spring I took myself off to a part of the world whose climate was totally different to my own. I went to a place called Taupo, New Zealand. I didn’t need a visa. I brought a bag full of food and some water. A hut at the foot of the Taupo Mountains. I sat in the hut’s hammock, listening to the birds singing in the trees. A man told me about the Taupo forest. I couldn’t have done it without the support of that man, and with a hat shaped like a hat. It had a ring of trees on each side of it, and it was my first experience of the forest. At the hut there were so many trees in the forest that it felt like it was the forest inside me. It was all green. I could hear the birds calling up to the sky above, the breeze in the trees. It was like a cathedral. When I heard the trees sing, I knew I had to do something. I started to write an article for the local paper about the forest there. It had never been a terribly exciting experience for me. Writing about this forest was like putting together a puzzle. And I would work around my timetable. I would read what had been published in the next day’s newspapers. The next day I would sit in the hut and think about it. When I got home, I sat down to put it all together and start to write. I was very keen to make it look as real as possible, so I started re-arranging things, putting trees where they could be seen. I re-arranged the furniture; I re-arranged the floor. I rearranged the furniture. I rearranged things. It took a few months, but eventually I did it. It took me two years, but it was worth it. My idea was to write an article about the forest, and the trees around it. But my idea didn’t go anywhere. And I did it wrong. So, instead of going to Taupo, New Zealand and removing trees, I decided to go to New Zealand and enlarge my stake there and plant a hundred more trees. It was a very strange experience. I looked at what trees had grown near to my home and I saw dozens of them growing up and looking straight at me. How could we have done something? It wasn’t a terribly big country, and the people who lived there were not the nicest people either. What we had was a big, wild country. A forest. An environment. A bog. What I wanted to see were beautiful trees. To see trees that looked a million times taller than any of the people I had met or seen in my life. I planted a hundred trees in Taupo and I sat on the front lawn. After a while the crowd went away to do something else. And then I planted a few more in Taupo. I felt good about doing this because I had a stake in nature that I wanted to see and the people I had met in Taupo were wonderful. All we had to do was put the stake back in – and they were all there. And the trees are there. So when people visit the forest, they stop to see what I have planted. I like to know what people think about my work because I was doing something different compared to the normal things people do in life. Sometimes the things I do","In 1989 I went to the New Zealand office of the World Wildlife Fund to talk to John Porritt. I was the new policy advisor for the environment at the UN. What is a climate change? What is the significance of climate change? Can nature and humans coexist peacefully? Why and how can we live with less than 75% of the Earth's current resources? I took Danny Danziger on a tour of the forests of the Canterbury Plains, where he asked him if he had ever seen any plants like this. He didn't. So he asked me where these were. I replied that they were planted by people that had a stake in New Zealand, a country with a climate quite different from Britain. He asked me what I would plant, and when. I told him that I'd planted a tree, to remind me that the only thing that can save us is trees. Besides, we are now in the biggest and worst drought in the world, and we really need the rain. In the book Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology I tell him about the climate change campaign that I became involved in during this period. I also tell him how the first ever tree planting campaign was organised at the beginning of the 21st century, and what environmental causes have made environmental campaigners to become so political."

C1,"The book is a great family story. Emma is the perfect protagonist for this novel. Her character is portrayed as complex and full of personality. It is easy to relate to Emma’s world. The first few pages are very exciting as the author shows us Emma’s family and what life must be like in the 1950s. However, at some point Emma has to look down on the boys. It’s obvious he aspires to be a thief and a robber. He makes Emma think there’s a better life in the country. The book is well-written, but I feel there’s so much more to this story than just her and her friends.

He tries to pull her into his web of deceit and crime, manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends, who are persuasively drawn by Coppard. The plot is incredibly detailed, from the characters’ reactions to the bookshop’s owners to their behaviour and interactions with Emma and her friends as they search for clues to unravel the truth. It is a well-constructed, compelling and enjoyable book for teenagers.","Hide and Seek is a clever story about the consequences of being too loyal to a parent, and how the consequences of being too selfish can make a terrible mess of one’s life. Emma and her friends play a holiday game — surveillance of a suspicious bookshop. They soon find out that the owner is their Uncle Jim. Although he’s only ever been in the shop once in a while, he knows Emma is hiding there all the time and is determined to get in the way of Emma getting to know him. He wants Emma to be unfaithful to him, but she wants to sever all ties to him. She realises that the shop’s owner must be hiding in plain sight, so she sets out to find him. She watches as the bookshop owner comes in and out of the shop, then disappears. Emma is so concerned with her Uncle Jim’s secret — that she even disguises herself as him to hide from him. She keeps an eye on him, until at last she recognises him as the man in the store’s security camera, who she can’t escape from. As her friends gather in the bookshop to smuggle a book into the country, she realizes they must also be hiding something from the owner, so she and her friends leave. Emma is forced into a series of awkward situations, as she unknowingly takes the bait and gives in to the uncle’s lies and manipulations, even after she has realised her own vulnerability. When one of her friends tries to help, Emma realises that the real thief is the one she has become drawn to, and she decides to leave him. Emma’s friends help her uncover the hidden clues. As they do, she learns that she really does have the book hidden inside the shop. By the time the detectives arrive, Emma is too close to the crime, and the book is stolen by her uncle, the book’s owner, and her classmates. The bookshop’s owner is arrested and incarcerated.","Emma, the heroine of this bestselling psychological thriller, is a high school student who returns from her summer vacation with a plan — to become a detective. Her friends, the three teachers in her class, are all enamored by the intriguing new detective, Cathy, although none are entirely aware of the bookshop’s nefarious intentions. Meanwhile, Cathy’s eccentric and withdrawn mother has come to stay with the family in order to help with the investigation. Emma and her friends are playing a holiday game: surveillance of a suspicious bookshop, when Emma realises that one of its rare customers is her Uncle Jim. He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime, manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends, whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard. The bookshop is owned by Emma’s uncle, and there is a reason why he was hired by the children to run it. Although Emma is convinced that he is responsible for the shop’s unusual behaviour, she soon discovers that he is a liar who is trying to divert the attention of police investigators. In another instance, Emma discovers her Uncle Jim’s identity, only to discover that he is also trying to hide this. As she discovers more information about Jim’s identity, Emma is determined to find out what he is hiding from police. One day, Emma comes across his diary and begins researching him. As they begin to gather information, Emma realises that she has found a piece of evidence that reveals the truth about the bookshop. At the same time, Emma sees that she has made a mistake in interpreting information that her Uncle Jim has given her. She immediately goes to the police station and admits her mistake. To her horror, she is surprised to find out that not only was her Uncle Jim her uncle, but also that he was also the owner of the bookshop. The police have no idea where the bookshop lies, nor how the people who are in the building know where the bookshop is. The bookshop owners have never shown Emma or her friends the bookshop, but the police suspect them of stealing it and attempting to sell it. Emma is determined to get the bookshop closed down and thrown into prison. To prevent her imprisonment, the police have to convince Emma that she is in fact innocent of the crime that her uncle is attempting to commit. She then begins to suspect that the people who are in the building are actually the owners and that she is not being truthful. She begins to suspect that Jim has been framed by the police – though he does not reveal it to them. Emma finally realises she is innocent of the crime and decides to get them to drop the bookshop robbery. The police arrest all three of them, but their escape is foiled when they see her in a room with a bookshop thief, who is actually her Uncle Jim.","Hide and Seek is a beautifully drawn, intelligently crafted novel about two young friends and an Uncle who deceives and tries to steal Emma's attention. The novel is not about the bookshop that the characters hide in but the game that Emma and her friends play. The bookshop becomes a place for Emma's friends to find answers to their questions about what is going on. Emma is kept busy investigating the mystery as her friends get suspicious as to what is going on. The author's description of the bookshop is both descriptive and accurate, as are the descriptions of Emma and her friends. There is plenty of description of the characters of the three friends as they play the game and try to keep themselves from being seen by an Uncle who appears to be hiding from them. Each person has his or her own motive for being there. The descriptions of the bookshop are precise, though they inevitably lead to questions about the place.","Hide and Seek Yvonne Coppard Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game — surveillance of a suspicious bookshop — when she realises that one of its rare customers is her Uncle Jim.

The answer, her friend tells her, is yes, and the photo is P.D. James, the celebrated crime writer. P.D., a self-described novice policeman, takes off her glasses and hands them to the headmistress. She tells her about the picture, that the pupil, a girl with long, pale hair, was a thief, and that he had left his wallet on the desk. The headmistress hands him the picture and the girl takes hers. It is the one she had taken out at the time. P.D., a man with a moustache, a cigarette in her hand and a pencil in her hand, has been on the job for over 30 years. She retired from the police service just last year. She likes to think she is doing something worthwhile. ""It's a mystery to me,"" she says. ""Is there a criminal on the loose?""

C1,"As a farmer, it’s our responsibility to look after the poor and needy, orphaned animals that find themselves at the mercy of the local calf gang, or the highways and railways. These unwanted, abandoned and rescued animals are a big issue in this area and many go to slaughter or suffer cruel treatment, and many others are killed for food. The sad truth is that there are more than one way of looking after them. The best answer will always be a home for the orphan, so I took over on Sunday, taking one last look at the two calves and deciding that they would be re-homed with Derek in the barn, with Derek’s help. They had already been there for over two hours when their mother disappeared. We took her into our holding pen with other calves and gave them plenty of good food until we could look after them all. We waited until the calves had re-homed the calves on Sunday and sorted out their housing together. That was when they suddenly started to make a little noise in the small barn, as if a car had been parked outside. The children were quickly over and out, while the calves were left to sleep in the barn. They seemed to enjoy their time in their new environment. They then settled on their bed in the barn, where they stayed until we were ready to bring them up and put them into their new home. One evening, as the re-homed calves were lying in a cosy area in the barn, I noticed that the calf was clearly starving. It turned out the calf was still alive when Derek brought it to us and took it from us. I then took her back to the barn for further checks. I took all of her muck away and gave her water and feed. The next morning we got a call from another farm that needed to take their baby calves, including our three calves, to a local slaughterhouse. We didn’t have any muck left so we decided to try to dry the calves in an open fire. This worked, but the calf was so thirsty that we had to use a bucket with a syringe to bring the muck out of her calf so she would have to eat it before we could put it back into the barn. When we got to the slaughterhouse, one of the men, a farmer from England, said that the calves had suffered a horrific injury and that there had been no more milk for them. He said there was a large amount of muck, but it was too dirty and difficult for them to consume. My hope for these calves was that, if they survived, they would be put on to pasture and provided with the much-needed food and milk. The calf was so weak and scared that the farmer took away the whole shebang. At that point the calf looked very malnourished and weak. So what do we do with them? He asked me, as he held one of the calves in his arms and whispered, ‘If there’s one thing I can’t stand it’s when a cow cries. If you’ve cries, they’re probably sick, because they’re in pain. This is the reason that I am a dairy farmer first and foremost. Having the chance to get a better look at the calves, and at the whole herd as a whole, was something that I enjoyed immensely, and something I haven’t experienced before. I’ve never been in an animal farm in the UK before and was surprised that, despite not being able to see them from the stall, I could see them. In fact, when Derek put them in the stall, they seemed to cry, as well. And I got to hold them, unable to believe how little they’d grown. Once out of the stall they started to make some noises – tinny little grunts, grunts that were quite like snorts, and grunts, which were reminiscent of grunting cattle. As the calves lay more eggs, I could see that, besides just being very hungry, they probably needed a home in which to grow up. I wanted to make sure they had everything they needed to develop as cows do. We moved the calves onto a raised ledge in the barn, with a muck crate nearby. I wanted to make sure that they could climb onto the ledge, as well as crate","This Sunday, when the farmer’s daughter delivered five lambs to the local rescue centre, we were approached by a farmer who wanted to help with the lambing season. Our idea was to set up an outside sanctuary for the lambs until they could find a new home. On that sunny spring day, we found two abandoned lambs, with one still attached to their mother. The three were too poor to get to the rescue centre, but their mother’s sister had died, so the lambs could go to the vets. Derek then asked us to come round and help. He explained that we would take them on a saturday afternoon and that we would put them into a bigger room where they could recover. They took well to being confined, and were soon doing well. We were so impressed that we decided to adopt the lambs, so that no lamb would have to be put to sleep. After weeks of hard work, our first lambs were born on Thursday 14th September.","Our family has always been very close to animals and rescuing orphans is one of the ways we try to take care of the environment. Derek and I are particularly passionate about our work with orphans. Before we started the farm, we had spent many winters in the UK, caring for and rescuing orphan goats and calves that have been abandoned on our land, as well as pigs and rabbits. When we moved, we brought our animals back and we still care for animals that were abandoned or injured. However, recently we found an abandoned bull. We rescued him, and after about four years we realised that he needed a little extra help. It was Christmas and we had a good Christmas, and there were lots of presents in our stockyard. When we found the bull, we couldn’t believe what we found. All of the wool was torn and dirty, the horns were bent and it felt like we had stepped into some kind of spooky nightmare. He was in so much pain. After several hours of putting pressure on his body, his back and limbs had finally given out. The other orphans had died from stress, not starvation. We also found a dead pig that had been found on a farm just down the road from us. We called the vet immediately to reassure him that the animals were okay, and that we would be taking them to a nearby dairy farm to be slaughtered. We decided that we would also take in one of the bulls that had been abandoned there, hoping that they would recover. We brought the bull to the farm with us on Christmas Eve, with the help of two volunteers who walked the bull in the fields on his own. He was so weak that he needed to be sedated with cold water. Once sedated, the bull had to be thrown into a cardboard box and moved onto the hay stall. Our bull has just now reached his full size and weight and looks a lot like his parent. He’s certainly a little different. On Christmas Day, it turned out that the bull was still alive, having gained a few pounds of weight with his new diet. We were able to save the life of his calf by taking him in during the first week of December and then moving him to a new farm. This gave him time to recover and we were able to have our Christmas dinner. The next day, Derek and I took the bull to our local dairy farm where the heifers were ready to be slaughtered. It was really sad to see such a precious little bull being left to die. The heifers were too young to be slaughtered and we just didn’t want to lose any more lives over this one. We contacted the nearby local farmer, who sent us the video of the bull being slaughtered. The farmer took the video and then put it on YouTube. That evening, Derek and I contacted the farmer’s daughter and told her about our rescue and that we were going to take a break from caring for the bull. The next morning we woke to find a young bull that had died. The vet contacted us and agreed to take it in. She said she had already been looking for a suitable home for the bull. We put the bull on her dairy farm, where it was grazed in the field until we could move it to a farm on the other side of the farm. After four days, we had the perfect cow! He told us it was a Holstein. We bought the cow a year and a half later and a month later we were able to take the bull in. The bull has gone on to produce a number of calves, but none of them are very milked. At one point we had to turn the bull out to pasture, so she could be milked by his cows. Two days later, we reunited the cow with her calves, who both weighed seven pounds. We then placed the calves on our dairy farm, where we have a separate flock which grazes in the paddock and has a separate barn and room for the rest of the calves to stay. This past summer we adopted six chicks and have had a bumper crop this year.","In the last year we’ve found ourselves fostering eight orphaned calves – and now eight new ones have arrived. I’m genuinely proud of these new arrivals and cannot believe there are so many more calves in the world that are being killed in the slaughter house. I took the opportunity to introduce two of our calves – a pair of rams named George and a calf named Max – to our family. George has a very large heart and is very sweet and is a real character. Max is quite young and has just recently been found in a nearby field with two other calves, so we’ll let him stay with us for a couple of weeks until they are all old enough to be deemed ready to be put up for adoption. Max is slightly bigger than George and has a very large heart. He is now very friendly and eager to please his mum. The rams have found a new home in the field – and a new mum. My helper, Ben, has taken on the responsibility of looking after them and it has been quite a job, especially with all the rams coming in and out and bouncing around. My biggest problem is that the chickens want to be at the feeders – they are used to living in the paddock! So with the two calves together we were able to get both out of the rams, onto a large pen and set them up for adoption. The first three calves were quite small – so we were able to feed all of them until they were big enough to be in our back yard. The four young rams were euthanised after their mother died last year. The euthanasia process left them very dirty and smelly – and they could never eat again. The hens could not afford the worming and antibiotics that they needed. Then the three young ewes were treated for a disease known as ‘cuckold’ – they’d gotten very ill after catching their mother in a mist. The hens were never allowed to stand on their hind legs, so they spent most of their time in their mother’s belly. The little ewes were also never allowed to eat. The rams all eventually got on with their lives and they were soon all making their way into our backyard. Once a year, one of the rams, called Joey, gets sick. He’s a lovely heifer but gets very weak when he’s around one to three years old. We always make sure he’s well looked after, but this year was unusual in that, as most rams are under five years old, he went in to a hospital for a check-up. Joey is now a beautiful, strong-willed six-year-old, who is great with children. It’s also lovely to know that we care about our animals enough that we get regular reports telling us how wonderful they’re becoming.","And there’s the added bonus of having loads of friends that come to feed and cuddle the cattle we’re raising. Last weekend we took in four cows that were left without mothers or fathers by a farmer in Newquay. The first arrived when we arrived home from work a little while ago. The other three escaped – they stayed with us all evening – and we took them to a nearby stud farm, where they were kept until they grew up and were ready to be re-homed. I’d had a vision of one of my four dogs ‘watching’ the cows – I’d always liked dogs. It wasn’t until my son Josh and his girlfriend Bethany arrived from London that we learned of the farm’s reputation for caring for orphaned animals. When we first started our farm it was not just the cows we were caring for. In our early years here we kept sheep, pigs, hens, llamas and a tame donkey. The idea is that all these animals are able to be cared for, so that people can go home and know that we’re there for them. But recently we had a large calf born at the same time and we were really worried about it. We had to euthanise it. To be honest we thought it was just a bit sad. Now that it was older and had been re-homed we worried about it. At first it seemed a good idea. However, after four days it suddenly was not right. I couldn’t believe it was just a four-day-old. At that stage it started to appear that it was not the best animal for us to look after. We had to put it down. When the calf was born we put a calf board up on top of her as she has a very small head and we wanted to use the space to give her the best possible start in life. As soon as she’d gotten her feet wet, we took her to an empty cardboard box and a bucket to give her a little water. As the calf weighed one ton and was so weak, we put her into a milking pen with a straw mat and water bottles. Soon she was strong enough to take a bottle of water and feed herself by herself. Soon after she grew up and is now fully-grown we brought her to the old calf board and used a metal bucket to bathe her. During the next few days she settled in well to her new home. Her first job will be to take her out of her small plastic hut to get more milk for her growing milking herd.","A large box had been delivered containing several cows’ skeletons, and some of the fat. It would be our first step into a new life, but it was the only one we had. We decided to give the calves a chance to settle in, before getting them fed. We tried offering them a bottle, but they wouldn’t take it, and we thought the cows should be able to figure out what they wanted without the bottle. We decided to try to get them accustomed to a real milking machine so they didn’t have to be milked twice a day. Soon, they settled in, and began to milk. Our milk cows were very happy, but now that they were in the company of calves from other farms, we thought they would get used to their new environment. It was not going to be easy, though. It wasn’t until a few days later, when we introduced the calves to a cow, that they started to grow fast. We put all our animals through a rigorous socialisation programme that meant they started to trust us. One year, we bought two dairy cows as a pair, and soon the new additions took over the milking operation. Since they were so young, they weren’t able to suckle properly; they were too young and not very strong and couldn’t even lift the heifer on their own!","I was bringing up a large box full of bags that one of my helpers had canned into it. I was afraid to walk into a dark room filled with muddy clothes because they were full of chickens. We didn’t want to wake the cows or disturb their sleep. I jumped into my chair and started to pick up the bags. I realised the bags were filled with all the dirty food I had brought and put them into a large plastic jumble sack. Derek went to fetch an empty crate with the bucket. I arranged them in a line and then put the bags into the crate. Derek picked up a large crate full of water and began to pour it into the bucket. When he reached into the crate he noticed something in there, a dead chicken. Derek looked at me and said, ‘Let’s try to put some chicks in there.’ He then placed the chickens in the crate and set up the electric fencing. It took about 45 minutes to get the chickens into their new enclosure. When I found them they were in my hands. Derek grabbed a bag and started kicking and pulling. I started picking the chicks up."
C1,"The reviews do play a significant role in a book’s success, according to British publisher Bloomsbury. Its director, Simon Finch, said: ""People buy books because of reviews. If we have an interesting book coming out and you recommend it in a review, it’s the book we’ll go buy."" He added that many of his authors include recommendations of books in the back of the book, with a quote: ""If a friend bought this book just because of this review, it would have been a massive seller."" But he questioned the importance of the review in itself: ""Reviews are useful and often the first part of a newspaper we turn to."" His chief executive, Helen May, said: ""I know what it takes to write a review. We’ve always reviewed books ourselves and I don’t think we've read them all - but the ones I have read are the most important for the people who are writing them."" In the wake of the Brexit vote, reviewers may worry about how Brexit will affect the way book sales are measured. Publisher A: Reviews are an important factor in book sales, and our senior managers see reviews as a key element. ""Booksellers are very quick to turn to reviews when planning a range of publications for the summer, so it’s very interesting for us to see how reviews affect sales,"" says May. Assuming that reviewers have the right information, booksellers can decide whether their recommended reads are worth purchasing or not - for example, whether they’d like to wait for the book to be republished elsewhere. This will then feed into sales figures.","As the reviews start rolling in, some publishers are beginning to worry that critics have lost their touch and are simply too eager to make a quick buck. A leading British publisher says it has already started to review its books more actively. Publisher A: Yes, reviews are absolutely key. The first part of the newspaper we turn to is the review. It's the first part of the newspaper that we turn to. For me, the review of a book is absolutely key. It's the first part of the newspaper we turn to. Publisher B: Absolutely. This is not just a marketing thing - it's an important part of the research that goes into making a decision about whether or not to buy a book. You've got to be able to use reviews to build a sense of readership. Publisher C: Definitely. It's the first part of the newspaper we turn to. It's the first part of the newspaper we turn to. Publisher D: Not a great deal. Publisher E: It depends. Sometimes reviews can be a useful way to make a connection between two books. Publisher F: Yes. It's one of the most important pieces of research we do. Publisher G: Reviews do have an effect. If the reviewer seems to be enthusiastic about the book then readers are more likely to buy it. Publisher H: Absolutely. I mean, I'm in the business of buying books. It's all I know. Publisher J: Very little. I don't even pay attention to book reviews. It's a bit of a crapshoot, to put it mildly. Publisher M: When the book is reviewed, you do tend to see the author on stage and chat to the reader. I think it's a really useful tool for me. Publisher R: Yes, absolutely. It's the first part of the newspaper we turn to. Publisher S: I don't really read book reviews. Publisher A: There aren't many of those in Britain. I don't think people pay that much attention. Publisher B: There are, but only because they're usually on expensive products - you pay money for a review when you buy a book. Publisher C: I think they should - but in my view it's too important to give up too soon. Publisher D: No. We've got a very good relationship with publishers, and when you're dealing with some sort of major brand, you want to make sure that the experience is great for the reader. Publisher E: But I have a hard time thinking of other types of reviews - for example, an editorial review that focuses on the content of a book, for example - as important to the reader as the book itself. Publisher D: Yes, they should be a good thing. Publisher E: They're really important to publishers. For me they are the first part of the newspaper I turn to when I'm deciding whether to buy a book. Publisher F: Definitely. I'm in the business of buying books. When the book is reviewed, you do tend to see the author on stage and chat to the reader. I think it's a really useful tool for me. Publisher M: Definitely. I think they should be a good thing. I have a hard time thinking of other types of reviews - for example, an editorial review that focuses on the content of a book. I think they should be a good thing. Publisher J: Definitely. I think they should be a good thing.","Publisher B While book reviews are an important part of marketing a book, they aren't very influential. What has got to be said about the impact of reviewers is that some reviewers are just plain wrong. A book is still a great book regardless of the content of its reviews. Publisher A You can’t buy a great book if you don’t think it’s a great book. Publisher B A book review isn’t about hype - it’s about whether the reader can relate to the author. The reviews are crucial, but people might be more inclined to like a book if they see it as being written by a particular author.","Publisher B: Reviews play a huge role in sales. They are the first part of the newspaper people turn to when reading a book, and they provide a great first impression. I would say about 95% of people who do a Google search for a book will read a review. Publisher C: Reviews don’t sell a book, though they may help. For example, one of my books, ‘The Long Wait,’ won the Guardian's Book Review Award back in 2014. In 2017, this book was shortlisted for the Evening Standard Book Awards, a shortlist only awarded to the best book of a year published outside the United States. But reviews didn’t sell the book at the time, as I had not made it to the final round. Publisher D: Reviews don’t sell a book, however well written they are. For instance, one review of ‘The Long Wait,’ by British author Helen Gurney, was panned, and it took us three weeks to find a reviewer who was ready to read it, not five minutes. What about a book with two good reviews? Does anyone buy a book at the recommendation of one? Publisher E: I don’t know if anyone does. But I’d guess it probably wouldn’t matter. Publisher F: Reviews aren’t much help, particularly when it comes to books of very short length that are sold on e-books. Despite this, our publishers are actively encouraging the publication of reviews in hardback. They are very helpful in getting books picked up in the right places. Publisher G: Reviews don’t necessarily sell a book, although they definitely help to promote it to readers. As I mentioned, reviews may or may not help the sales of the book. But it can’t hurt the sales.","Publisher B We are keen to understand and to help authors write books that sell. One big problem publishers face is trying to decide whether to include reviews in their books and whether to include reviews at all. We asked five leading British publishers to answer our questions: Publisher A We often include reviews when launching new books. The review consists of a short summary of the main idea of the book. However, as soon as a book has been published and we publish it, we look at whether we think it is worth including, if the reviewer agrees with us, the key idea of the book. In other words, if the reviewer thinks the book is worth including and there is an argument for a lot of negative comments, then we do not list the book in the book and there are no reviews of the book. Publisher B Reviews are absolutely key for publishers – the first part of the newspaper we turn to. Publisher C We do not include reviews at all when we launch books. We look at whether we think it is worth including, if the reviewer agrees with us, the key idea of the book. In other words, if the reviewer thinks the book is worth including and there is an argument for a lot of negative comments, then we do not list the book and there are no reviews of the book.","Publisher A: Yes, reviews definitely sell books. Publisher B: No. Publisher C: They might help the authors, but they don't sell books for us. Publisher D: Yes, they might help the authors, but they don't sell books for us. Publisher E: Yes, they might help the authors, but they don't sell books for us. Publisher F: No. Publisher G: Yes, they might help the authors, but they don't sell books for us. Publisher H: No, they probably don't sell books for us. Publisher I: No, I don't think they really do. Publisher J: No, but the readers will often read the reviews anyway. Publisher K: No, but the authors' response might be different. Publisher L: No, the reviews do influence some but not all books. Publisher M: No, because readers don't like the book.","Bookseller A Bookseller has seen a huge increase in the number of books that have had a review published since the advent of the Internet, so reviews are a big deal for them. Bookselling guru Andy Coulson said that while the number of sales had fallen by 6% since 2009, most of those had been from books that had never had a review published. Author B Author A says he is not affected by reviews. Reader B agrees with him, saying that they are not the only factor that has a bearing on the decision to buy a book. Publisher C Publisher C is also not affected by reviews, but it does influence whether or not a book will get bought. Publisher D Publisher D agrees with him, but it has nothing to do with the reviews. Publisher E A review is very important for a book to be picked up by a retailer. Publisher F A review is very important because it influences the reader. Publisher G A review is also important because it influences the reader's decision to buy a book.

C1,"It took a lot of courage, but he did it. He took a risk. He did what millions of Americans did: he slipped up. But his actions were far from random. They followed the same pattern: first, as he entered a bar, the clerk showed him a cigarette ad he’d seen in the last thirty years. As he pulled a carton off the shelf, the clerk asked him if it belonged to him. He said it was a cigarette from a chain called Philip Morris, an industry affiliate. The clerk looked at him skeptically, but he agreed to let him try the cigarette. Besides, he promised, it couldn’t hurt. He took the carton back to the clerk. When the clerk opened the carton, he saw the cigarettes, arranged one way only: first, three packs of each brand, then one pack of each of the three cigarettes in each of the three cartons. Finally, a cigarette brand with a yellow label, two packages of the three cigarettes in the two packs that had come with the pack, and a clear picture of the person smoking it: the person in the yellow box. He took the cigarette and lit it. It burned red. The clerk wiped his mouth with a tissue. He walked away. The clerk asked him again, “Why aren’t you smoking?” The clerk nodded. He told him that he had to go. He was standing next to the clerk. He looked up at the clerk who was looking at him. He said, “That’s a big cigarette.” The clerk was enraged. He looked at his watch and realized it was six-thirty. He pushed himself through the clerk’s door, still smoking. He opened the door. A second clerk followed him, sat on the opposite side of the floor from the clerk, and took a puff on her cigarette. The clerk started to cough, then took the cigarette from her mouth. He coughed so loudly that the clerk fell to the floor, her face covered in soot. He looked back at the clerk as he walked. The clerk was looking at the cigarette ad and asked for the time of day, and then put the cigarette in his pocket. As he turned around to leave, he walked back into the room and opened the door. He opened it with a slight creak. A few minutes later, the clerk began to cry. He pushed the cigarette back in his pocket. He said, “Look, I don’t want to smoke.” The clerk took a puff from the cigarette. He looked up at the clerk and whispered to him, “It’s fine. It’s not that bad.” The clerk asked her if she was serious, and she said, “But he never told me when he was a kid.

C1,"Despite his long awaited return from Olympic training he has had to cut short his visit to Kenya. The Kenyans’ high-altitude training camp offers one of the few glimpses of the world’s best runners at high altitude. It’s not just the mountain and gruelling runs he’s interested in, it’s the people: a bunch of friendly men and women who, in addition to running, cook for their families, carry sacks of supplies, and are themselves as fit and in great condition as anyone you’ll meet on a trek to the Kenyan highlands. A barefoot runner in the morning. A jogger in the afternoon, carrying his oxygen supplies. A young Kenyan boy in a khaki t-shirt, wearing a leather backpack on his back. A woman in tights, a shawl on her back, and a chubby-cheeked child on her front. A young Kenyan man, barefoot on the muddy tracks of the nearby highlands. Nerurkar runs into him on the descent. He asks if he is okay. “Not sure, mate,” he says. “He’s just training for the marathon and I’m just running a half-marathon, so I don’t need to train to that level,” he says. “I’m fine as I am,” Nerurkar says, as he goes up the path, over the edge and around a ridge to an imposing rock formation. The sky is grey and hazy. It’s too cold for running.","In a land of vast vastness and vistas of blue sky the long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar from London is one of Britain’s top 10000-metre runners. At twenty-nine he has won seven world championship titles, and is among the most experienced runners in the world. To prepare for the summer Olympics, Kenya has built up a huge and comprehensive training camp on a high mountain. The Kenyan athletes come from all over the world, but especially from Kenya and are accustomed to challenging themselves, both physically and mentally, so this is no ordinary training camp. One of the athletes, Nair, asks the visitors if they can join him for two nights. “Yes”, they say. The first night is free. “It is quite hard to think that they are really not prepared for this type of training,” he says. At the end of the second night, “a group of three or four comes round. The first one wants to tell us that there are a lot of Kenyans here. I hope that they will go up soon. I am afraid there is going to be a lot of pressure,” the athlete explains.","Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner from the northern United Kingdom, takes a break from training to visit Kenya's high-altitude training camp. Ten miles south of the equator a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. The track is muddy and windswept, and at night it is covered in thick grey smog. A blazing fire is lit near the track to keep away the chill, but it is not warm. A bare tree-lined path begins the climb to the mountain's base camp. The first climber is Sammy Aduwo, who is twenty-four years old and one of the top five climbers in the world, though he suffers from severe PTSD, and the rest of the pack is composed of older men and women. Sammy's grandfather was a top mountaineer, and Sammy is trained to climb to heights of four thousand metres, so it is not surprising that he is used to running at high altitude. Sammy's younger brother Sam was a top athlete in Kenya in the 70s, but his sister, Emily, who also climbed to heights of four thousand metres, did not. When Sammy started out, he set his mind to reaching his highest mountain at Mount Everest in 1978, and is now a world-renowned mountaineer. Before Sammy came up, Sammy was a top-class marathon runner. Today, Sammy walks the mountain for his morning walk. Sammy lives at a lodge in the bush, and there are three dogs who live with him. They bark whenever Sammy leaves the room. When the dog barks, it signals that it has gone on patrol. The other dogs lie in wait. It is common practice for the dogs to sleep near Sammy to avoid worrying him when he is out running. When the dogs bark, it is a good time to return to camp, and this is exactly what Sammy decides to do when his friend returns home. In the morning, when Sammy comes to collect his dogs, he is seen by a small group of local children walking down the track. They call to each other as they pass. A few minutes later Sammy's little dog starts barking. He barks at Sammy once, and he comes to, barking as well. Sammy follows Sammy up the hill until they reach the summit. At the summit, Sammy's bare foot drops to the dirt, and he falls to his death. With every step of his body he falls. His arms twitch and his heart races. He goes down to his knees, and he is saved by a rock. He falls to the ground, and is thrown from his rock, where his bare feet have been rearranged by Sammy. When he wakes, he is told by Sammy that he is now the fourth fastest mountaineer in the world, after Kenyan Alberto Contador, Kenyan John Kipchoge and Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie. Sammy goes to the top of the hill, and begins to descend slowly, but he is tired and he has to run. At the base of the last hill he reaches a river which flows into Lake Turkana, a huge lake that covers an area of more than 25,000 square miles. He crosses a shallow bog and is on a path to the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. The route down the mountain is covered in snow, and it is inaccessible in the winter. He is glad that the route is easy and the weather is perfect for running. The first five climbers and their packs are given instructions in the camp tent. One climber has to walk for three hours with his pack, while the other four must hike four hours, but they are allowed to sleep in tents at all times. For the next two nights they sleep on the ground in tents, and they are given oxygen masks to keep them hydrated. When the group disperses they are taken back up to the camp. Sammy tells Sammy they are not allowed to go down, and that he has to wait until they regain consciousness before he can go back up. By the time they reach the base of the mountain, Sammy says that he has reached the top and is now running, so he has to go first. The first climbers and their packs are given the chance to sleep in tents, but","""When I'm not running I'm watching football"".

They have been living and training at the high altitude camp for eight weeks. For five days, they are living in tents, trekking on rocks and running on the rocks. To prepare, they have been given three meals a day; two breakfasts and two lunches, accompanied by a hot drink, before dinner and bed. They have been drinking water the whole time they train. They also have to avoid eating too much and drinking enough water. They have to wear waterproof jackets and boots, eat three times a day and sleep under the stars at night. At around 2am every day, they walk to the nearest shop to buy food. They also use a weighing scale to track the progress of their bodies over the five-day period. By the time they reach the top of the mountain, they have already weighed 100kg. The Kenyans plan to train together throughout the mountain season. They train hard and have strict dietary requirements so that they can gain the maximum fitness in a few months. Each one of the team members will start training in the months before the Olympic Games in Beijing. The first week of training has been spent in the tents, walking and talking.

C1,"The ‘boat of my dreams’ was the dream of Tom Cunliffe. Tom – who spent more than 30 years travelling the world – wanted to take the idea of the modern day ‘square-rigged’ sloop into the future. That’s the idea behind ‘The Westerman’, a 25-foot-plus, open-plan deck yacht with a gable stern. The idea is largely influenced by his childhood, which was spent on the Norfolk Broads. He would be a typical English schoolboy, but never got much aspiration about joining in the music scene, either. It all started in 1989, when at a yacht show in Spain, Tom met a Swedish yacht designer by the name of Herman Heinek. He spent time with the man to discuss what he wanted a boat to be like – and what he wasn’t. Their brief was to “have a great sailing experience” and an ‘obvious, evocative design – a sloop that combined a traditional look with the latest design technology. Heinek liked the shape of the boat, and agreed to build it for Tom. So together, they bought an old schooner – which they named The Westerman – and designed the boat. The Westerman will be one of the first boat-builders in the world to be awarded a UK Marine Design Mark for their craft, which Tom says will be recognised by the industry as “the best boat of my dreams”. In the UK, the Westerman will be built at a new building site on Lichfield Road in Kent. “The building is an experimental area of our industry,” says Tom. “The site will be built by ourselves in our workshop – a big part of the craft – and will be used for everything from woodwork, to manufacturing, to testing. The Westerman will be built to a high standard with a good choice of timbers. The plan is to build up to four hulls, with a final order for a seventh vessel. “Our design team have been working on a variety of new designs, but we have never been so confident that we can build the boat of our dreams”, says Tom. The boat is an open-plan design and Tom has chosen an open hull shape – similar to the classic sloop, but with a modern gable end. The gable end, when fully extended, creates a deep-v hull, meaning that it sits below the waterline. With the addition of some small deck spaces, the yacht will fit three passengers, who can sit comfortably alongside the boat. Tom is keen to build a wide variety of designs as a way to attract a wider range of customers. “When I first started, I was worried that the sloop was not going to be successful,” he says. “But it was a breakthrough.” Today, the Westerman is made from teak. The first step will be to create a boat centre, or centre of gravity, to aid the design and engineering process. He hopes the new centre of gravity will be the focal point for the next stage of the design work – construction, finishing and launch. He will also be studying in Sweden for two years. “The hull has been designed with an open hull and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a boat with a very long keel. “It needs to be the kind of hull that can be steered with any degree of control and it needs to hold its keel well into the water. I am planning to use my experience with building the sloop to help re-think the layout of boats,” he says. The Westerman will be launched in November at the Sea Trials show at the London Boat Show.","A CLASSIC REVOLUTION - A classic hull shape is one that has survived for decades and is as suitable for sailed today as it was when it was first made, or in the case of the Westerman, over 100 years ago. The asymmetrical and sleek line is unmistakable, and this has shaped the way many yachts are designed and built today. For Tom Cunliffe, a naval architect in Bath, this is a vital ingredient in the best boat. 'The Westerman' is an example of how a classic design can be adapted, adapted and reinterpreted in the newest age. The bow is broad and pronounced, and it has a wide transom for a wide range of water sports. Despite its modern looks, the interior is elegant and relaxed, with plenty of headroom to accommodate large families. The aft cabins are more compact than those in many modern cruisers and are particularly well adapted for small families. The Westerman's bow is long and the helm is aft. But it is the aft cabin that is particularly unique. It is a unique arrangement of aft and forward cabin, but with a forward cabin with a table and two seats that allows the helmman to sit at a table while sailing. Two oversized sunpads are built into the bow for even more sunbathing space. ""I've always thought the best boats do not change with the times. They are timeless,"" says Tom Cunliffe. ""They have evolved in response to people's needs, in response to their dreams. If you look at the current crop of boats, there is little trace of what made them unique."" Despite her ancestry, the Westerman owes her contemporary look to a couple of stylistic choices. ""My boat has been designed to follow what people want, i.e. to sit on the water, be stable, look out for other boats and be comfortable and safe in the rough. It has to look good in all weathers and look as good in wet weather as it does in dry. ""Our design reflects this, which is why you don't see so many'revolución' (revolution) vessels. They're almost all symmetrical, with one or two contemporary tweaks and the use of carbon fibre. It is hard to see a boat with a 'no frills', 'all spec' approach like many other boats of her type. This is why I believe that it is worth considering old and new when designing a boat. As an example of this, the Westerman is made up of a superstructure that is a symmetrical asymmetrical rig which gives her an extremely stable balance in the water. The aft cabin is also made from carbon fibre, as are other parts of the yacht. The aft galley is the only other area of the boat that gets the attention of sailors. It is dominated by a large sinkhole and a trawler-style forward cabin. The stern is symmetrical, but it has a deck with a large sunpad on top. The deck above the water line has a double berth and a full-width awning. The deckhead has a flattened stern and a full-width masthead. The two pilothouses share the aft cabin. The boat is built of aluminium and built by an English builder. It is powered by twin Cummins engines which are matched to the boat's electronic control system. ""We have a great design team on board that are absolutely second to none in every respect,"" says Tom Cunliffe. ""This is a real design team.""","Tom Cunliffe. designer of The Westerman, is one such example. He has designed a boat, which he hopes will be able to take people to exotic places. Cunliffe says that the best boat design should combine old and new. He grew up in Devon in the 1960s, and he became a sailor at age 22. After that, he worked in a sailing boatyard, then became a yacht designer, helping to create such boats as the Perpetual 79, which is the model he was able to build in his spare time. The boat he designed in 1990 for his own use, the Westerman, is a 60-foot long, 23-foot wide, one-engined ocean-going sloop designed by Richard Smyth of Westerman Yachts.","For Tom Cunliffe, yacht designer, the best boat design should combine old and new, and his new vessel is a shining example of this.","Tom Cunliffe, a boat designer from Berwick-upon-Tweed, has had his own boat - The Westerman - designed to combine the old with the new. Tom's parents had a 30ft yacht, known as Westerman, a traditional design that he first saw when he was five. They thought it was a beautiful boat, but not one that would take him sailing from the English Channel to the Isle of Wight. So they moved to the Isle of Wight, where they had their new home. After he joined the Royal Navy he went to Europe and later learned how to design boats for the Royal Navy. But it took a lot more to get to the UK and he ended up in England. The hull of the Westerman had been a design for two generations - the first from the late Victorian to the 1960s. It was an example of the symmetrical, bow-cutting hull shape that was used by the Royal Navy for over a century. It was not until the 1970s that the yacht was rediscovered. For the first time, yachts were designed as open water yachts and with high volume engines. This trend accelerated, and the slender, fast, and low centre of gravity yachts, also known as catamaran, sloop, and cutter, were designed. It took a lot of imagination to design a sloop that would have been comfortable and stable in all weathers and not get bogged down when on the water, even with powerful engines and crews of several dozen people. To achieve that the designer had to combine traditional techniques and technologies, such as a high ballast level and a large displacement. He wanted the boat to be both stable and easy to manoeuvre. He wanted to avoid stiff hull sections in rough seas and to improve draught, so he had to create a planing hull. This technique had been used extensively in the late Victorian period for large sailing boats. The Westerman is a symmetrical, bow-cut, and centre-board style yacht that sails in a symmetrical arc from side-to-side. It is a small, light yacht and can be easily towed by a large truck. Tom grew up in Harrogate, Yorkshire, where there is an active sailing club. He went to college at York University to become a physics teacher, and soon joined the Royal Navy. While there he was working on his PhD at the National Physical Laboratory. In 1994 he volunteered for an expedition to Antarctica. For the refueling trip he ducked into a bar and was told by a friend to take a bottle of alcohol. He was hooked. The trip was a life-changing experience, but he needed to find a boat. He started to design boats in 2001, but soon lost his inspiration and had to resign from his job. So he put aside his engineering interests and took on the job of designing a vessel. His first craft, the 4.7m (16ft) 'Winterman', was a carbon fibre monohull sloop built by a team of naval architects and designers in the UK. While working with a small crew, they set about making the vessel from scratch. Two years later it was launched. Tom now runs the company where he designed the hull and boats his family has built for a dozen years, and is now designing a second boat with his wife, Charlotte. The pair live in Norfolk with their two cats.","A THOUSAND BUDDY SHOOTER. The hull of my boat is shaped like a cow's back, in the shape of a horse's rear - with three cow's backs - and there's a cow that is on either side - the 'Cow-Bow-Van'. Its engine is a conventional electric motor which allows you to sail the boat. The hull and interior are classic with an unfinished teak deck and teak furniture, the head is fitted with a marble counter.","Tom Cunliffe, an accomplished yacht designer from the UK, has his own boat, the Westerman, which is one of the best examples of how an old hull-shape revolution can give way to cutting-edge technology."

However, some blacksmiths still maintain that they have the same power to control fate and make the world a better place than the original human beings created it.","When you get your head around that all blacksmiths are skilled artisans, the next time you’re on your way to a blacksmith shop, imagine how exciting the job could be.","Blacksmiths HAVE had a huge impact on the world for centuries, for many they have contributed to the development of civilization.

For the Blacksmith of today, however, it is still a way to get a wage and a living, as most men are still employed in manual labour.","Blacksmiths have always been an extremely skilled group of people who have fashioned all kinds of weapons, armour and farming tools, from the common farm implements like a plow to the more exotic and advanced weaponry like a sword. Today, they are only a few of the few people left who have the necessary skill to forge and shape iron.","Blacksmiths THROUGHOUT the ages iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers because they were the sole providers of weapons, armour and farming tools."
C1,"It’s a year since the museum opened and it’s a pretty special place. The old Scottish parliament building is now a museum, a short cab ride away, and the new one is a futuristic cheese-wedge designed by architects Foster + Partners. But what about the contents of the building? Sally Varlow went to the Scottish Tartan Museum in an effort to get a feel for the place and how the collection came together.","If the first thing you see when you enter the Tartan Museum is the colourful tartan piping, then you'll be in the middle of a madcap maze that has spanned the entire site of the city. But there's a lot more to see than tartan. The museum opens on 4 June, ten days after the last major work on the site started. The Scottish National Museum, conceived by architects Foster + Partners, is set to become the nation's second-oldest building. The site had been used as a hospital, a police station and a prison. The architect says they chose to break with tradition, and the museum will feature a ""mix of traditional architecture and bolder forms."" Although not all of the exhibits on show are related to Tartan, there's plenty to help visitors appreciate the rich history of the Highland nation. Visitors will be able to explore the origins of the tartan, meet the makers of the cloth, see a collection of traditional Scots artefacts and see the work of the Scottish Royal Armouries. Those not interested in tartans should take a guided tour of the museum and admire the artifacts - all donated by individuals and businesses - which tell the story of the Scottish nation. Visitors to the museum will also be able to purchase original tartans, and learn more about the Scottish tartans made famous by some of the world's greatest artists. The Tartan Museum's design reflects the spirit of Scotland. It features a large number of windows and sashes to allow in as much light as possible, and visitors can see the landscape of the Scottish Highlands through the huge glass spheres. The museum also includes interactive exhibits, such as a ""Tartan Trail"", which guides visitors through the Tartan Museum, allowing them to make their own journeys through the history of the tartan. Inside the museum, the exhibits are displayed in the shape of cheese wedges, with their blackened metal facade contrasting against the white of the towering castles and mansions which surround it. But it doesn't feel like a museum at all. Instead of being a museum, the Tartan Museum is a living and breathing museum. The visitor can learn about the story of the Tartan people - some of whom were forgotten even as they were able to travel far and wide to claim their cultural heritage. Visitors can experience the artefacts of the museum in the way that they might have seen them in the past. Visitors can explore the archives, examining how people viewed these historic items. For many people, the museum is a place of learning about Scotland and its history. This is a place where visitors can hear about the artefacts that will be on display, and to experience the history in their own time. Visitors can learn about the history of Scotland and the artists who made them, and to see the famous works of their favourite Scottish artists. There are plenty of opportunities to learn, too: the museum is situated within the ruins of a Roman fortress and has free tours on a daily basis. The museum's website has a wide array of exhibits, events and events that it will host as it grows and develops. The museum has been the site of two previous exhibitions which were both closed for refurbishment. The new building is due to open in June, but the Tartan Trail will be open until next year. Sally Varlow, a writer and broadcaster, travelled to the Scottish Tartan Museum in June to find out more.","A modern cheese-wedge building houses the Tartan Museum, the first national museum of Scottish Tartan in Europe. The building itself was designed by a British architects firm, Brutalist Architecture and Studio Innocenti. ""We wanted to create a space that reflects Scotland's history but that had a new, contemporary and exciting twist,"" says Sally Varlow, a researcher at the National Library of Scotland. ""There is a lot of humour in the building and the design plays to this."" The building was designed by Scottish architect Brian Brutalist, and opened to the public by the Royal Scottish Academy on Friday. It is the first museum dedicated entirely to the tartan and its history, and is housed in a cheese-wedge-like structure with arches and arched openings, which contrast sharply with the old town of Edinburgh. Sally Varlow was on the museum's opening day, to check the museum's authenticity before she wrote this article. She thought the museum's design might be a challenge to get right, but it seems to be a major achievement. The museum aims to bring together the history and heritage of Scotland, and will tell the stories of Tartans, the nation's textiles and fashion, as well as the Scottish people. The tartan museum is located in the Royal Scots Club building in the heart of the city. It is easy to find thanks to the museum's distinctive green signage. You may recognise it from the Queen's Commonwealth Rath. The building is just off George Street. It is accessed from the east on Queen Street, and the museum entrance is at the end of it. However, the museum is quite far from the entrance of George Street. It is located on the north-west corner of George Street and Market Street and in the vicinity of the Scottish Parliament, The National Gallery of Scotland and The British Museum. I was on the first floor of the main building. When I opened the door to my left, I was immediately in the middle of this space, and was immediately surrounded by a sea of glass. It is a polarising space. ""It has a unique interior and a unique concept,"" says Sally. The interior features mirrored glass, a large mirrored plinth and a series of staircases. The architecture tries to take on a Nordic or minimalist style, but not at the expense of detail. There is a large-scale replica of one of the most famous tartans on the planet, made by the Scots at Fraserburgh in the 18th century. Although it is not a modern design, Fraserburgh is very much a part of history, as it is said to be the home of King David. ""You have to admire this if you go into Glasgow,"" says Sally. ""The whole thing is so visually striking."" Sally is the author of ""The House of Spies, Inventors, and Artists"" and ""The Tartan Museum"" and lives in Edinburgh with her husband.","The Tartan Museum will open its doors for the first time to the public in Edinburgh on Friday (April 4). The museum's modern cheese-wedge buildings contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened. The buildings are an unmistakable departure from the cosy Scottish home of the Scottish parliament building next door. The old place is no longer used as a parliament and even the oldest part of it was demolished many years ago. The modern museum opened in a large glass-walled room - called the Tartan Gallery - on the first floor. Inside the buildings are rows of large white artefacts. The oldest is a huge, wooden beam that has been adorned with a huge number of tartan patterns. There are thousands of these. On the main floor is an art gallery that contains paintings and other artefacts. Sally Varlow saw the painting called ""The Slainte"" by John Buchan. The painting is on loan until the museum opens. A smaller piece is on display in the Scottish Gallery, a gallery of costume and music. The newest piece on display is the ""Sweeney Todd"" costume, which the museum says is ""so flamboyant and exaggerated, it is a nightmare to photograph"". The Tartan Museum is in Princes Street Gardens, opposite the Royal Mile, a short distance from Holyrood House. It is called ""Feather of God"" and ""Claddagh Claddagh"" on its website. Sally Varlow, a former art teacher in London, has lived and worked in Scotland for many years. She says: ""It is such an honour to live in such a beautiful and historic country. We have a history that goes back centuries. ""The first thing I saw when I arrived was the castle. Its appearance on the postcard was extraordinary. The castle was so huge, it looked like it had been plucked from the sky. ""When I got there, I was awestruck by the magnificent interior and, even though the building is remarkably clean and tidy, there are dozens of things in the dark."" The Tartan Gallery is the largest collection of Scottish tartan in the world and contains a huge range of Scottish-made artefacts. One of the most impressive pieces is the 'Edinburgh tattered' hat. It is made of carved ivory and measures about four inches tall and three and a half inches across. It is worth watching the master tattler at work. The museum has also featured an array of tartans in a new area called the 'Knot of Tartan' gallery. Here visitors can admire a collection of knitted kilts.","Tartans were Scottish inventions created by Scottish pioneers and woven for them by the Cromwellian family in the 16th century. The Cromwellian family built a network of tartans around the kingdom – a criss-cross pattern of tartan thread that allowed them to make blankets in all weathers. But by 1675, the earliest recorded evidence of tartan printing was the use of cloth from the 17th century. In 1690, a small cloth factory was established by the Robertson family, but only one of its original tartans – the ""Crosse"", was recorded by Cromwell. The earliest tartan in the collection was the ""Crosse"", which was woven over a wooden frame in the 16th century. The oldest was ""The Crosse"", which was only recorded after the introduction of dynamite in the 17th century. Other tartans include the ""Eigsfield"" – the ""Lilt"" – and the ""Assyrian"" – the ""Bead"". Almost all of these tartans are now on display. Scotland has an ancient history of tartan making, as well as the modern art of textiles, which continues with its own exhibitions. As we walked around the new Tartan Museum, we noted the many examples of tartans that are still in use. There was a large collection of kilts from the Scottish kilt industry, including some whose makers claimed to have been involved in the earliest production of textiles, as early as the sixth century BC, and early 16th century designs. Also of note was the collection of Scottish ceramics, which includes a collection of ""Kilts and Stools"". They are all now on display, along with the woven tartans which inspired them. Among the interesting objects were two early designs for carpets, the ""Penny Kilt"" which came into use in the 18th century. The ""Penny Kilt"", which was a design by Scottish textile designer David Bruce, became popular in Britain in the 18th century. The museum, located in the former St Nicholas' chapel, is home to a permanent exhibit of Scottish textiles and has an artefact shop where the collection is on display. An exhibition of 18th century Scottish ceramics. Another gallery displaying 17th century Scottish textiles. This space is a tribute to the explorer Sir Robert Bruce, who discovered the first pieces of Scottish tartan in a barn on the farm of a Scottish clan, the Forrests, when he was working for a crofter. The exhibition is free to visit. A glazed room of the museum. We were able to watch the artist in action in a large workshop making the ""Scottish"" tartans. The painting was donated by British entrepreneur Michael Ross. The museum carries out regular tours and talks for groups. The museum is open daily, 10am to 5pm except on major festivals. A family tour lasts an hour. The only exception is in March when the Museum of Scotland is closed for the season.","The Tartan Museum contrasts sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But will its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow, a keen history fan, went to visit the new museum, which opened yesterday (October 1). What stands out is the contrast between the cheese-wedge buildings and the historic Edinburgh location. The museum has some great tartans, and many of the exhibits are geared towards children, but in many ways the museum is designed for anyone aged over 15. 'This is a huge museum which has lots of items,' explains Sally Varlow. 'The design of the Tartan Museum is quite bold. 'The buildings are very futuristic and the interiors are very contemporary. I think this is a very exciting project for Scotland."" Inside the museum, you enter into a modern world filled with tartans. 'There are some very interesting objects that tell the story of the history and development of tartans in Scotland', says Sally Varlow. She's in awe of the sheer number of tartans. 'The exhibits are fantastic, and I'm a huge tartan fan.' There are also many Scottish items, such as an 18th century scottish cottage, a pair of black tweed boots, a Scottish kilt and other items from ancient cultures. A number of the exhibits are geared towards children and young people and it's interesting to see what they have done with these items. In one exhibition there is a room dedicated to Tartans in Victorian times. There are some pretty exciting things in here, with a Victorian tearoom. 'The Tartan Museum has loads of interesting items for Tartans.' The Tartan Museum has a huge variety of exhibits for Tartans. 'The Tartan Museum has lots of interesting items for Tartans. It has everything you could possibly want for an old Scottish house.' There are also lots of items for people who have no time to look after a tartan. 'The Tartan Museum has lots of interesting items for Tartans.' The Tartan Museum has a lot of interesting items for Tartans.","The Tartan Museum is on the move. A year after it opened in the heart of Scotland’s capital, it is now on a massive move to a new complex in Royal Mile. The purpose-built buildings are a striking contrast to the historic buildings, with the main entrance right next to the historic Royal Mile. On the first floor are rooms dedicated to the many aspects of Scottish culture, art and history. Upstairs are art galleries and archives, some with a focus on local history and others on Scottish art and design. This new structure is an integral part of a £1 billion makeover of the Royal Mile. The new museum aims to bring Scotland together through one collection of artefacts, artefacts, textiles, art and other artefacts, with collections covering all aspects of Scotland. With no permanent collections in Britain, the museum opened a large space in the new Royal Mile for an open exhibition. Located next to the historic Royal Mile, visitors have easy access to the ruined Royal Mile, the Royal Mile Museum and The Royal Botanic Gardens. In these buildings are also temporary exhibitions. The building has recently been refurbished and is set to reopen this summer to the public. The building was originally designed as the Royal Mile Hotel, a grand residence built by King Charles IV of Scotland. It was built in 1790 on the site of an old manor house which fell into ruin during the Jacobite Rising of 1745. It became a pub for high society during the reign of the House of Fraser. It was redeveloped between 1785 and 1797 and became the Royal Mile. The Royal Mile is the busiest pedestrian area in Edinburgh and the entrance to the Royal Mile museum has been named after the building, which can accommodate thousands of people at any time. The design also incorporates a large glass façade that looks like a giant smouldering mass of metal. It was built to resemble a cheese wedge from the original building. The museum aims to showcase Scotland’s rich heritage, presenting the world’s most complete and varied collection of tartan. The new space was created by the British government following an extensive programme of heritage partnerships. The museum is one of two new buildings designed by architect Zaha Hadid, whose previous work on the Royal Mile Museum was widely praised. In the 'Old Palace of Holyrood Palace' museum in London, a similar scheme was used to display an impressive collection of historic military artefacts, while a similar scheme has been used for the National Gallery of Scotland, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Galleries of Scotland."
C1,"One of the most famous astronomers in history was Sir Edmund Halley. Halley was born in 1656 to a Scottish family. As an astronomer, he made observations about comets, celestial navigation and the laws of the earth's magnetic field. His greatest contribution, he claimed, was the discovery that planet Earth, a mere 5 million kilometers away in the universe, could rotate on its axis at such a speed that it could be seen for the first time. He called this event 'Hallelujah'. Traditionally it was also called 'Twelfth Night'. Halley was a prolific contributor to astronomical publications and a noted English astronomer, who wrote in English for the first time in 1672. His observations of the comet were so successful that Halley declared it the shortest-lived of the planets. The astronomer's observations were so precise that they were named 'Hallelujah' after him. In 1831, the astronomer published his 'Hallelujah' book in the name of the comet. At the time, astronomers were in danger of collapsing from the pressure of the solar winds and changing equinoxes, which threatened the planet's survival. It was the first time a astronomer had published a 'Hallelujah' book. Halley's work is credited for bringing navigation to the world in the 17th century. Since then, it has been linked to astronomical discoveries such as the measurement of the speed of sound waves. This year's comet is set to pass just 104,000 kilometers away from Earth in 2024, but that's not a problem for Clark, an astronomy grad student at Oxford. On the other side of the world, Clark is working on a project to map the variations in compass north from his own area. Using GPS satellites onboard British ships, he will travel to locations such as Japan and Australia to collect measurements in the winter and the summer months. The long-distance travel will take him in a clockwise direction along the Earth's surface. ""It will be a lot of travelling and it will require a lot of planning,"" Clark told BBC News. He'll use that knowledge to help retrace Halley's path and figure out the factors he relied upon to arrive at his conclusions about the movement of the earth. One of the things he thinks is important is that Halley himself used a compass to guide him and others. ""The difference is that he was using a paper compass which is now demolished because the metal was more brittle than paper compass."" It's a way of tracking the movement of Earth and comparing it with that of the solar system. While Halley had been using an electronic compass in the early 17th century, it was not until 1882 that he developed a paper compass made from a wood fibre material. Clark is convinced that if this paper compass had been used in 1782, it would not have survived the centuries and would have been difficult to read. When the paper compass was first published, it was re-created by astronomers with paper compass in a spiral pattern. The spiral pattern is so precise that it can identify changes in the north and south magnetic poles. The spiral pattern is then used to generate a grid of grid points and coordinates of each grid point. Clark argues that the original survey was actually a survey of the polar regions, where he wanted to locate a true North. The comet's shadow falls on Earth just at the moment when the sun moves away. But Clark is using the same method he used in the past, to figure out what caused the shift in the north and south magnetic poles over the centuries. The spiral pattern has remained largely unchanged since then. ""It shows that, despite the advances in technology, the compass still has a lot of work to do to determine true north in Earth's surface,"" Clark says. ""The results of this survey will be used to help re-evaluate Halley's observations.""","In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark is retracing Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations, as the famous astronomer began describing the natural phenomenon in 1587. Clark is using modern mapping technology to compare the data collected during a 1586 British expedition in North America with the compass charts that Halley relied upon for years. The British Geological Survey, which helped create these maps, says these charts offer valuable information about the earth, including the strength of the magnetism. It also points out that Halley's comet has changed from a tiny, fading crescent to a bright, reddish, bright speck just a few weeks after it left Earth in 1686. Clark's colleague, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, is also examining these charts to determine what is true north. The radii of the magnetic poles are about 4 degrees north of true north, which explains why you can always point your compass north. In order to measure these radii, Clark had to collect data from the first expedition to Greenwich in 1586, just before the first Halley camet. Today, the study is still underway in Greenwich, but Clark plans to make the final measurements once the Halley comest is visible to the public on 21 August. A key part of the research will involve re-tracing the course of the comet in space by plotting the speed and direction of the comet's trajectory. The research is ongoing. Clark is hoping to discover where the comet is going and then to use his findings to calculate the timings for its return to Earth.","Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742), a British astrologer who pioneered the use of a compass to establish the true north, was a prolific astronomer and a gifted observer of the sky. But there was one man who could not be credited with devising the compass, a spherical object believed to be the planet Mars. The comet that bears his name, which was observable from the Earth about every 100 years, has long been the subject of popular speculation about its possible origin.","A research team is looking at whether Sir Edmund Halley's theory of compass variation holds true today despite being centuries old. As the British Geological Survey works to try and decode this data, scientist Dr Toby Clark at the British Antarctic Survey has published a report on whether a team of astronomers might be able to retrace the expeditions he conducted to record and publish compass variations. The British Antarctic Survey, which uses NASA's Kepler space telescope to help researchers plan space exploration, published Halley's Comet in 1758. The astronomer drew a map of the planet Earth in 1767 with one of his charts, titled The Comet of 1687, bearing the reference to Halley's famous comet. The next year's Halley's Comet will make its closest approach to Earth since 1769. In 1804 Halley published his observations that confirmed the Earth rotated about the Sun - and predicted that it would be possible to measure the movement of the planet Earth on earth with a compass. In 1869, Halley published a new work, titled ""Compass Variations in the Earth's Interior"". ""In this work we attempt to replicate Halley's observations of Earth's interior in 1768, and we also aim to compare the results of the 1868 and the 1878 observations, which indicate that a compass based on Halley's compass would have been inaccurate in the 1870s,"" Clark said. Clark is one of four British scientists, including Toby's father, Tom, who are taking part in the project to track Halley's comet. The work is being supported by the National Museums Liverpool. The astronomer is famous for using a compass to help establish compass variation and retrace Halley's travels. He was an astronomer who worked for both the British and the French royal houses. He also claimed the compass he used - a ""globe-spanning rod compass"" - in the 1600s. This is also reflected in the names of many European countries: the Netherlands and Belgium, for example, are listed as a country that uses the compass correctly. However, the British Geophysical Survey, which was founded in 1932, is looking at whether the compass system used by the early explorers could still be used for navigation today, Clark said. Earlier this year the British Museum's Natural History Museum published a book, Discovering Halley's Comet. In it, historian Richard Hodge said Halley's comet remained elusive because it was only visible to the unaided eye. Hodge was among the first to find a flaw in Halley's comet. ""It's a miracle it still exists,"" he said. The research was led by Dr Toby Clark of the British Geological Survey, which worked with NASA's Kepler space telescope to study the Halley's Comet in 1768. Clark first noticed the compass shift after the comet had passed overhead two centuries earlier. The comet became so bright and faint that astronomers could see its shadow. ""Halley's comet is now well known as the planet's most famous astronomer,"" Clark said. But Halley was not alone in his research. ""Toby Clark has argued that he was only one person who could identify and date the earliest observations of a compass,"" Clark said. ""So I am trying to retrace his steps if I can."" Halley's comet travels across the sky more than 80 times every year, but he didn't set an absolute date when the comet will appear. He also noticed that some of the observations could not be replicated accurately, so his telescope made use of the diffraction gratings - an invention used for capturing the star's light when it is observed - that had not been invented yet. Clark has previously used Halley's Comet as a model for the geoid, an electronic compass. The diffraction gratings became used for mapping the earth's crust. The researchers are hoping to track where Halley's comet will pass in the year 2042, when astronomers estimate the comet will come close to Earth. The British Geological Survey now has plans to test its diffraction gratings for accuracy in their future research. ""Our technology allows us to produce an accurate version of the ","The British Geological Survey (BGS) is hunting for evidence that Sir Edmund Halley was right about the sun. On Monday, astronomers from the British Geological Survey in the UK are hoping to do the same. The British Geological Survey (BGS) is hunting for evidence that Sir Edmund Halley was right about the sun. Its researchers are using an innovative instrument called a compass in an effort to record the relative strength of the sun's magnetic field and, perhaps surprisingly, whether the earth's magnetic poles are tilted. BGS researchers say they will begin using the device on Monday. The team hopes to determine how the planet's magnetic field is affected by varying climate, atmospheric and oceanic conditions. A change in the magnetic field of the earth would trigger changes in the compass's ability to help determine which way is north and south. In theory, a change in magnetic fields can cause human beings to go astray and explorers have a much better chance of finding the northernmost point of a distant planet by plotting the change using a compass. But, they warn, ""this is not likely to be an easy job"".","Scientists are determined to map out the changes of magnetic north – a clue to the exact year Halley came into existence. The work, led by Sir Edmund Halley and Dr Toby Clark, involves tracing the ancient methods of determining a person's location using magnetic variation in the Earth's crust. While the study may seem like a long shot, it may give us new insight into how Earth's magnetic field has changed over time. The team of astronomers – using a combination of traditional mapping techniques and the latest modern scientific techniques – aims to retrace Halley's quest to find true north. A reconstructed map spanning the last 500 years shows a slight shift in magnetic north: as the Earth warms, it moves northwards, a movement scientists say is similar to a natural earthquake. The shift is ""not as dramatic as it might have been if people had not known and acted to record what was going on,"" explains Dr Clark. ""To use the information that Sir Edmund Halley had and what we can now see we can map that to the present and then we can compare that with what might have happened 500 years ago."" While the results can't be verified by modern means, they show a shift that's similar to the effect of natural seismic activity. Dr Clark says he hopes to find out exactly what's going on and ""try to understand why it happened.""","Dr Toby Clark is attempting to chart the variations in Earth's magnetic field using data provided by a series of magnetic anomalies. His research will use the data to chart changes in the Earth's magnetic field. He is based at the British Geological Survey, and aims to use the research to inform his work to re-construct the Earth's magnetic field, with a view to establishing true north in an area that would never have been thought possible."

C1,"I didn't know this, but my mother was an avid mountaineer who had made a career out of climbing. She lived in South Africa for a time. And when we were there we would climb a lot of mountains. I was one of the few to go for five of the seven. She also did the Inca Trail and she lived to tell about it. She died when I was nine years old. I had no idea when or why she decided to retire, but she died suddenly when she was eighteen. That meant that my chance at climbing the Seven Summits was going to happen, but with time running out. As an adult, I have had two knee replacements. That took a lot of time, too. My first was at 63, and the second was when I was 65. It's taken me four full summers to recover, though. The third came when I was 76. It took a lot of work. My body needs a certain amount of time to recover from an operation. Once that was over, I had six weeks to train. I was also able to take an extended leave from work. I had a five-month gap between my trips in my first year of retirement, and a four-month gap in my last. So, I was able to climb three of the seven peaks in my last year of work, which was my only extra time off. I started going on longer routes in the summer, when I'm in prime shape. I also learned my altitude limits. My second year of work was my hardest because of a cold. I only went up a few of my harder routes because they were the right season. The last one, the Antarctic Icefall Route, was the hardest for me, because the mountain was just surrounded by so much snow. I only had three months of snow for the first five summits. The rest of my time was spent off the mountain, doing things like training in a hot tub, hanging out with friends at my place, and relaxing. I'd love to do this all again, but time is running out. As an adult, I decided that my best years were ahead of me. I had a hard time figuring out my retirement goal. I've been in the outdoor industry since 1982. I've been a professional mountaineer since 1998. I've gone to a few different winter resorts and one summer resort. While I have my professional career, my family, friends, and kids keep me very busy. I love spending time outdoors, cooking, reading, and gardening.","I’m Doug Scott, a mountaineer, explorer, writer, public speaker, broadcaster, and author of seven books, including: Seven Up Mountaineer, Eight of the Seven, Seven of the Nine, Seven of the Eleven, and Seven of the Eleven. I first heard about the Seven Summits on television and decided to read all of them, beginning with the Seven in the North. I figured that at the end, I wouldn’t be able to finish the book, so it was out of the question. I went on to climb the mountaineering peak of Kilimanjaro, which is located about 8,000 feet above sea level, and South Island’s Mount Adams. This was the only thing I could do that year, since I’m American and couldn’t afford any climbing equipment. I then climbed Mount Baker in California, and Mount Rainier in Washington. I also trekked through the Arctic Circle, the highest national park in North America, and walked in a blizzard the same year. The last mountain I climbed was Mont Blanc, one of the Seven Summits. It was a long, but beautiful, trip that took me to the North Face of Mont Blanc. This is the highest mountain on the continent. I waited in a tent on a glacial moraine for five days, and was on the summit with my husband, Doug Scott, for the entirety of the climb. It was a long climb. I had a climbing partner whose health was in ruins. But Doug Scott did a great job.","Doug Scott climbed all Seven Summits and his story is inspirational. The journey begins when he was 15 years old and includes the following points: His father was a dentist and after seeing him for the first time he remarked, ""Your dad is a dentist too!"" To my surprise Doug immediately told him that he was going to the dentist that day, and that my dad was going to be getting his wisdom teeth out. As he reached ten he then proceeded to describe a patient who had grown a beard on the mountain and he was going to apply the same treatment to it. Doug took this patient to the dentist. At the dentists office the patient was told about Doug Scott and he signed a waiver allowing the dentist to perform the operation on his teeth. Doug explained that he could do this operation as a few days later at the end of the month when there would be no wait. After the procedure, he said, ""I have a lot of respect for Doug Scott for what he has done in his life. I would say he has a mystical ability to work with people and he is a spiritual man. His ability to work with people is amazing, and his ability to connect with people is what separates him from everyone else. The final step for Doug was to climb and then trek across the Everest Base Camp. The climbing was arduous as Doug was dealing with a significant nerve injury. He says, ""It was a truly memorable experience, so much so that afterward I decided that it would be the next thing I would do in life."" Doug then shared his thoughts on each of the seven summits. ""The summits can be like a dream. The first summit was a total shock. You were on top of the world and knew you were on top of the world... When you get to the top you feel like you are on top of the world... When you get to the top you feel like you are on top of the world. You are just in awe of how far you can get."" Doug then shared a few other pieces of advice on how to be on top of the world. Doug says, ""Smaller mountaineers often get to the top first and then try to hike or climb the rest."" He also gives tips on climbing the Seven Summits safely. Doug continues: ""You should try to be able to enjoy a small mountain, something that you know will be beautiful and will be yours to keep forever. Just do not get out of breath and take on the problem... When you climb the Seven Summits there are no guarantees that you will get home alive. On top of each one you are going to experience a different feeling. For example, if you are descending, you can't be too scared of the fall. Just go slow, use your hands and feet and don't let your breath stop when you reach the summit. You should also enjoy the great views around each mountain. On top of each one you are going to be able to see the next mountain you will be climbing.""","I was 24 when I first visited the Himalayas. I visited Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet and spent many a day in the high Himalaya. After many mountaineering expeditions to many high mountains in those countries, I was fascinated to learn that the mountaineering legend, Everest was not a mountain. Everest is a peak, and mountaineering is the highest sport on earth. Everest was originally climbed in 1953. It was the last of the seven tallest peaks in the world. The other four are on Africa, Asia, South America, and the Himalayas. These six summits are the highest mountains on each continent except Antarctica. This is a feat not usually accomplished by people of average physical strength. The journey from the base camp of Mt. Everest on the third day to the summit in just over eight days is as dramatic as ever. Scott describes his mystical experience of climbing each mountain in this book.","Having climbed the Seven Summits, Doug Scott shares his account of the most mystical experience of all—the feeling of achievement at the top of the world. The author explains why it is so important to pursue a goal even at the expense of others, and shares the lessons he learned. 1. The Seven Summits require a different type of preparation, as one has to do things a little differently than one might do for something like a mountain marathon. It's a marathon, not a race. That requires a certain amount of training and preparation time, and it also takes some planning. The amount of planning that needs to be done can vary greatly, depending on the type of race and the time of year, but the main elements of preparation that are the same throughout are: training, practice, and endurance. 1. There are many resources available for training. One of them is a mountaineering course from an accredited mountaineering college, or a training course designed for mountaineering at a local gym or climbing center. It is a long process, and not all mountaineering courses offer this. I took the two-month RockClimbing with Rick, and as part of that course got the skills of a basic climber, how to move in and out of a rope, ice climbing, and how to use protection equipment in order to protect yourself when you fall. 2. Getting training time. Most people only have one or two training days a year. This is where I went on a training course in preparation for the 7 summits. I wanted to learn how to epect the mountain as I moved up it. I learned that a lot of peaks take a lot of climbing. You do not go in expecting to summit them all the first time. Some of these peaks can be very difficult. For example, if you go to the top of Mt. Everest a first time climber might expect it to take them five days. It took me about eight days to complete the five days of training. It can take five or six years to conquer all the peaks. 3. Preparedness. In addition to the physical training, you have to take into consideration: your training, your gear, your mental preparation, and how close you are to getting to the summit. You cannot get in any shape for the 7 summits if you are not physically fit. Getting in shape for the seven summits means eating a proper diet and trying different types of food. You are not going to go for a walk and not run; you must run. You have to walk to the top and make sure you make sure you do not get run over. You have to get ready for the weather. Mountaineers go to the mountain when the weather is the best. When you are going to go climbing you need to have all the gear you need, your personal clothing that you intend to wear on the mountain. You also need a good GPS that will give you the best idea of where to go. You have to know where you are going and how long it will take. You have to know when you are going to eat, how you are going to get to the summit, the climbing route and any dangers. You have to know what gear you need, so that you can be prepared. You also have to know when you are going to sleep, and how many hours you are willing to sleep. 4. In preparation. This is a good one to do at home, but do not just take it out on the climbing trail or a hiking trail. You need to get a guide to lead the climb, to provide you with the advice you need to climb each one. This may be the easiest part. If the guides are too smug, you will probably go out when you can. 5. If you get injured during the climb you will need to be well prepared for your injuries. You should stay hydrated, drink water and prepare for anything that might happen. Don't eat too much until you are ready to summit. Don't take any food with you until you have summited the next peak. 6. Mountaineering is a meditative exercise. You should also take good care of yourself. It's the only way to finish such an amazing journey. 7. It's a great challenge. If you're healthy you'll have no problem finishing. But if you're not healthy you might have a hard time going up. You have to be prepared for any type of physical and mental challenge. The hardest part of every trip is the challenge and getting to the top. And the best part is when you've succeeded. That's why we call it","John Wayne’s mystical description of the Seven Summits is a perfect fit for Doug Scott, a man who has climbed the high peaks on six continents, notably Antarctica, and ascended three of the ten tallest mountains in the world. Scott’s saga starts with how he, aged 45, became interested in climbing when he spotted the Seven Summits on his way to Africa. Once he knew of the climb, Scott enlisted a group of friends to help him climb and conquer the Seven Summits. In his memoir, Seven Up, Scott details his psyche-rising to the top, the struggles he went through, and the mental and spiritual challenges he faced. One of the most profound things he learned about climbing was how the experience of attempting a challenging climb affects and impacts the person on a personal level, including the relationship one has with the mountain. One of Scott’s final summits was on Mt. Everest, but it was one he didn’t do. However, Scott reflects on the lessons he learned from his challenge, and how this experience changed his life.",Climbing the 7 Summits and writing about it inspired this biography.
C1,"I always tell people I love the photos I take of people, they are the most interesting of all subjects, they always show the best side of people. The things I like about people is their diversity, they are all different and they have a different personality, it brings out something about you in them when I photograph them. It is so important to photograph people for their individuality. People also get really nervous in front of the camera and scream and run away. There are many things I do to make sure the people that I am photographing seem natural to me and natural to them. I love being able to take pictures of people from all kinds of perspectives as I enjoy capturing different things about people. I enjoy getting people to pose or laugh or get into a good pose, there is nothing worse to a photograph than having to crop a shot and having it lose some of the drama it started with. I do like photographing people with funny expressions, sometimes the best thing about being a photographer is being able to capture those expressions! I will continue to photograph people for as long as I can. I hope that I have helped this image speak to you and give you a better understanding of some of the things that are important in taking a great photograph.","Photographing people is a difficult task. In fact, some people are so tricky to photograph that they get stuck. But the following tips are not just to help you get a good photograph but also to make sure they behave nicely. 1. Make a composition.: Having a good composition gives the viewer a clear overview of the scene. Keep your background as simple and uncluttered as possible. A cluttered background will distract from the subject, and it may even make it harder to find a good subject. Secondly, don’t just take a random photograph. Try to look carefully at the subject’s face. Notice the emotion in their expression, the way they move and even the look on their eyes. Try not to rush or interrupt a shot. Focus on what is in the frame and not what is on the background. 2. Look at them from below.: If you are taking a head shot, focus on how your subject looks as though they are looking straight down at you. This is the most common pose for a head shot, which can be seen in the image below. Look at the photo and concentrate on how your subject looks when your eye is below your nose. If you are taking a torso or a pose from above, focus on how your subject looks from an angle above. Look closely at your subject's eye. This is the way it should be looking. People can often say anything or do anything. If you are focusing on how your subject looks, you may end up with a less flattering photograph. 3. Look at the background.: A well-placed backdrop, either on a wall or over the person, will often work well, but not always. It will draw your attention to certain details, and make the photograph feel more important than the people in it. For example, look closely at the wall behind your subject. If the subject is walking, ask what their shoes are, where they are sitting, and if they are wearing a coat or hat. If you are focusing on the background, you may have a harder time noticing where your subject stands or sits, and in which direction they are facing. When taking a shot of the people in a room, keep your background neutral so the viewer can focus on the subjects. Try not to put a lot of distracting things in a small space. If possible, get the shots as close as possible to the subject's feet, and as far away as possible from where they are standing. It will make the photograph appear more grounded. 4. Avoid over- or under-exposures.: The light shining through a window or a car window could be over- or under-exposures. Too much light can make an overly-lit scene look flat, dull, and boring. Instead, use a soft, diffused light. Ideally, this light should be reflected back at the subject rather than coming directly through the windows. Soft light is created by passing a sliver of light between two lights. The more a subject is lit, the more it will appear like a bright white sheet, when viewed in different angles. This effect can be made more effective by playing with the amount of light that hits the subject at different angles. The effect can be increased by placing different lights so that some are placed at different angles. Try to use different lights so that some are in a different place in the scene. For example, put lights above the person in the foreground in an angle that gives the viewer a wide angle view. This will give the viewer a wider view of the scene. Use a soft diffused light if you cannot find a better light. Avoid over-exposing people and keep the light low on the subject so that you have a wider range of light to work with. It’s important to be in the right place at the right time to get the best result. 5. Use a steady hand.: It is extremely difficult to photograph people. The first step in capturing an image of a person is to have the subject hold the camera steady while you take the shot. Take a look at the camera in your hand to see if there is tension. If you can see tension in the person’s hand, this can be interpreted as a positive or negative emotion. If there is tension, this indicates the subject is upset or worried. Try to avoid overexposure by using a shutter speed that produces fast shutter speeds. Try to use shutter speeds that are appropriate to the situation. For example, I am shooting a family portrait, which will require very high shutter speeds. So, my camera is set to 1/180 of a second and will have a shutter speed of","Photographing people people are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations, the photographer has to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. At first I thought that the fact that I was standing directly in front of a window posed some difficulty. However, I came to learn that this is hardly a problem when shooting groups of people, who pose in a natural, interacting manner. However, I was not aware that it also proved to be a problem in photographing people sitting still. Therefore, it could have been an ideal shot when the subject is either standing still or posed in the same way. In this way, I was able to take a photograph that was more personal and interesting.","Photographing people is very interesting and challenging. There are many things to consider when photographing people. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations, the photographer has to be conscious of actions gestures and expressions.

She will be back in just an hour to report back. Christopher Middleton thought it was hilarious.","The hotel owner, Charles Swindells, is the only one who realises this and is furious with the receptionist for ignoring him. The real guest – one who does not leave his hotel for days – also has no room at all and this is when Sue Brown, a guest herself, enters the hotel with a vengeance. The receptionist has merely gone back to reciting the room rates, which she knows will only send him to a compromising position. The inspector quickly turns her attention to Swindells’ clumsy attempt to escape by jumping off the cliff. A huge wave of panic runs through the hotel, the front office staff panicking in an attempt to dodge the inspector’s gaze. They panic on and off until Swindells realises that she has just killed Sue Brown. The receptionist is stunned into silence and reveals to Sue that she is actually an actress and that there is no way she was here to murder her. She finally gives up and apologizes to the inspector. Despite her denials, the inspector is impressed. After all, the hotel had been rated at 4.5 stars on the review website. This has got to be the lowest in the country!","The hotel is slammed, Sue Brown is warned, and the Globe is thrown out of business.","Sue Brown is a Hotel Inspector. Christopher Middleton is an ex-serviceman who works at the Globe Hotel, which is under the supervision of Hotel Inspector Sue Brown.

Fortunately, the unruly guest, named Richard, is clearly not the only one at the Globe. Nevertheless, the receptionist has no idea who she is talking to on the phone. He can only assume the other guest is Richard, who has no intention of sharing his secrets. Richard is so nervous that the receptionist is unable to respond to his calls. Luckily, Richard does not revert to the rude receptionist he was last seen, whose attitude leaves his voicemail message to the Globe Manager, who will hopefully give Richard a chance to explain the matter to the inspector.

C1,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst As it turns out, a study published this week in the journal Experimental Psychobiology found that handwriting can reveal a lot about a person’s character as well as their personality. A study published in the journal Psychological Science showed that people who write their names differently tended to have strong personalities, and people with strong personalities also generally have neater handwriting. It has now come to the attention of many of the authors of an article in today’s issue, which is entitled The Role of Handwriting in the Perception of Social and Psychological Character. The researchers found that the handwriting sample they received from applicants was also much more typical of the applicants than the samples they got from those who didn’t write their names differently. It’s not the only study showing how people write reflects their characters, as the paper also looked into how people’s handwriting can predict their personality. Researchers also found that handwriting can predict people’s willingness to take part in group activities. For example, in an experiment in which people wrote out messages in different handwriting styles and handed them to the experts in a particular field, those whose handwriting appeared to represent their interests scored higher in the group activity test than those whose handwriting reflected their aversion to having to answer survey questions. Some researchers even thought that people who wrote in an unusual style of handwriting might end up with a personality disorder, such as a psychopath. It’s not the first time researchers have shown that a person’s handwriting can reveal information about a person’s personality. The British Psychology Society found that handwriting also predicted the tendency of a person to go to the gym more and exercise more, as well as their propensity to drink. But there’s nothing that says handwriting can be used to predict a person’s personality. One group of researchers found that people whose handwriting looked like a person in the army, for example, were more likely to be emotionally unstable and to have a tendency to deviate from their religious faith, compared with those whose handwriting had more in common with a non-Armenian. This group of researchers also suggested that some people whose handwriting looked more like a character in a play would be less impulsive and more likely to be aggressive.","An experiment on British students shows that some students do not write well in pencil or ballpoint pen, while others do very well. And some students write better than others.",What do you think about the idea that the pen mightier than the psychoanalyst? In what way do you think a person’s handwriting can reveal something about their character?,"A British researcher has just found a way that you can read a person’s handwriting by analyzing their letters. The method, which he discovered in Italy and has been running in America for almost 10 years, says there’s no way to be sure that it will be conclusive, but it’s a useful approach. What he says is that handwriting is very subjective, and people may have different styles, shapes and pressures on their fingertips, and these can be linked to things like intelligence or personality. So while this method might not be foolproof, it could offer a glimpse of someone’s personality. “It would be a great way to detect personality and character traits that are still hidden,” he says.","This is a short story for A2 learners in the CEFR scale. It is a humorous tale about two men who don’t know each other very well, but don’t mind their differences. 1. In Britain, you could be asked for a sample of your handwriting. 2. There are many countries in the world where you will almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. 3. There are also a lot of psychologists who specialize in handwriting, so the chances are that your handwriting will reveal something about you. 4.

And it would be the handwriting as much as anything that would determine your suitability for the job. And this is no coincidence. When William Blake wrote his famous poem, “The Sleeping Beauty,” there is a quote about the writing process. The person who wrote the poem must have had a difficult and stressful time, so their handwriting reveals their inner feelings, their moods and their hopes. The study has led to many hypotheses. In some cases, handwriting can be compared with other art forms, such as painting or sculpture, or even music. The painters of the early 19th century and the impressionists of the 20th century were compared with their handwriting. While some critics have called Blake’s work a form of metaphysics or the study of skepticism, others see it as a new way of looking at things."
C1,"Often the poorest people don’t want foreigners occupying their homes, or stealing their stuff. But it often turns out that local people want tourists doing good work for them, and volunteer tourism is a major part of the solution. Four academic writers explore the problem of foreign philanthropy in international development. ""How are people to know how much aid to give when it comes to what they do? Are they really doing it?"" they ask. ""The real answer lies in whether you do it yourself or have the assistance of somebody else to fund it,"" Professor Philip Sheldon argues, a professor at the University of Sussex. ""It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly."" Sheldon said that for the vast majority of volunteers, it is hard to distinguish between making a meaningful contribution to the environment and helping to exploit others. He said that if local people only had to decide whether they wanted to donate their time to help a developing country, they would probably do it themselves if they saw an opportunity. However, volunteer tourism is attracting a lot of attention due to a number of factors, some of which Heldon argues are harmful. ""Other social and environmental benefits that come with volunteering are largely overlooked,"" he said. The issue of how much philanthropy to put behind a programme are more important than the 'need' for foreign volunteers to give a certain amount. ""When people want a life-changing experience, they want it to be done in the best way possible,"" he said, adding that the impact of international volunteering has often been a 'fake'. Heldon said that there are three philosophies behind how philanthropy should be used. ""First, philanthropy should be about helping people in developing countries."" Second, philanthropy should be about generating interest, and third, philanthropy should help to keep governments spending money on development rather than providing foreign aid, he said. Heldon said that for people to see how development actually works they must engage with local people. He said it was important to remember that development and poverty are two completely separate issues. ""On the one hand development works by empowering the poor and boosting their capacity to achieve their own well-being,"" he said. ""On the other hand, poverty is caused by exploiting people."" As he explains, development is a continuous process of a process of exploitation. He also suggests that as people work on development, they might take a different approach than some people have in the past. ""They are in fact working on the assumption that the development will come automatically, but that often is not the case. People come to a place and they do what is natural for them in the local context,"" he said. ""But they are a group of people and they don’t just come and go, it will have a long lasting effect. Ultimately it can work either way. Volunteer tourism, which he describes as 'tourist tourism for people who want to work for themselves', is in fact a form of charity tourism. He said that there are different types of charity and volunteer work that are not mutually exclusive. ""They are essentially complementary because they help solve different problems,"" he said. The most prominent example he cited is Oxfam, which operates a volunteer programme that trains and sends volunteers to countries affected by disasters. The programmes are run by Oxfam and the British Red Cross. ""The volunteers are paid and the projects are largely funded and funded by the UK government,"" he said. ""So these people are doing good.""","Volunteer tourism is a phenomenon where tourists spend a lot of money travelling around the world on voluntary programmes. Volunteer tourism is a subset of tourism, which is primarily focused on adventure travel. What can we say about the people who spend money on it? Can we claim that they have done something helpful? Or is it just a way of having fun? Volunteer tourism was started by tourists. The concept has been around for more than a decade, although this particular form of tourism seems to have started to get a bad reputation. This article has used the text from the book 'Women and Voluntary Work: Exploring the Unexplored Dimensions of a Popular Culture' (Pearson Education, 2007), by Wendy Stout.","Volunteer tourism, while not a form of tourism in itself, provides a means to help local people. But it is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly.","Four academic writers discuss the topic of volunteer tourism, which they describe as “a form of development tourism” where a group of tourists spend time helping local communities.","“Volunteer tourism is really just tourism masquerading as development assistance,” write two academics, the first who was born in New Zealand. The second is a specialist in rural development and health education in Burundi, where he wrote an article called Why is the world so poor? He went to see the work of an NGO on the island of Dominica, where he found that the local people really did not need any help in maintaining the health and well-being of their people. “We don’t need lots of volunteers, we need lots of development workers and we need to put in the time, to take our place, to help the people who are really in need. If you go on a volunteering trip, there are many volunteers who can help out.” He said he hoped his story would encourage people to think before they go on their next trip. “There’s a lot of volunteers out there doing good things with people who are not in need,” he said.",Volunteer tourism can be a great way to get outside of your comfort zone. But doing so also presents risks. Volunteer tourism could cause more damage than good if it is done unintentionally. It is important to choose a volunteer program or project that aligns with your own values. A person will have no idea what the organization is about when they arrive. Volunteer tourism is also one way to take a break from work or school.,"Volunteer tourism is an old-fashioned concept that goes back centuries, and is still practiced in many countries. On the one hand, it is a form of development aid. Its major advantage, however, is its ability to bypass the strictures of international convention, or any official government rules regarding the way foreign aid should be used. On the other hand, it is not as easy or as effective as the development aid it replaces. On this question, four academic writers disagree. A. It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. In many areas, the contribution of volunteer tourism has waned in recent years. The authors look at the economic factors of this. The first is a lack of economic prosperity. In other countries, particularly in Africa, most people can only afford small salaries that are lower than they would earn working as a domestic employee. This means that these poor people cannot afford to go abroad without leaving their home. A. The economic factors are even worse than the economic reasons. In some areas, such as the former Soviet Union, poor people are forced to emigrate after they leave the country. They are unable to find a way back to the countries they left. They find it difficult to settle in a new country, to have new friends and to establish a family. On this basis, they struggle to make the transition to new life. They need time to adjust to the new life, and they may not be sure what they want. They do not have the financial means to buy property and buy land, and they may feel that their only option is to leave and move away."
C1,"There is something deeply satisfying about discovering a lost treasure in a museum. To me the best part of the experience is walking around in the dark and being the first in line to see a piece you admire. I was excited to discover the Greek and Roman sculpture at the University Museum of Classical Archaeology. To be honest, I was a little nervous because I was worried that I had already been there before and knew the collection. If I was wrong that I would be a bit disappointed. But seeing that I was right, I enjoyed finding it and now I can appreciate some of the beauty of the ancient world through the eyes of a modern, educated adult.",The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.,"There is a special exhibition on the cult of Zeus in the Museum of Classical Archaeology, titled The Great Deception, by Professor George Eddington. Professor Eddington is a professor at the University of Sussex and he has been working with the collection for a number of years. In his lecture, he describes the casts in great detail, and then explains what the exhibition is about. Professor Eddington then goes on to discuss the fakes in more detail. Professor Eddington talks about their various origins and where they were made. He says that when the casts were made in the late 19th century, they were very close to the originals but they did not come close enough in detail to give them the same feel or look. He explains that some of the castings were based on engravings and some were created entirely by sculptors who had been trained in the art form. Professor Eddington also discusses how the originals were found, and describes how this was then worked out by studying the sculpture. Professor Eddington concludes his lecture by talking about the role the museum plays in modern society and how it is different to other ancient museums.",The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world comprising over six hundred works.

The University Museum of Classical Archaeology was one of his stops. It had many replicas of Greek and Roman sculptures in different sizes and shapes. He was especially drawn to the statues of Greek gods and the reclining figures of Greek mythological heroes. The first thing that Alex was really interested in was the statue of Zeus. While on a tour, the professor showed Alex a painting of Zeus by an Italian painter who had drawn a cartoon of Zeus reclining on the ground, a painting that Alex was familiar with.","David has just arrived at the University Museum of Classical Archaeology for the first time. At the reception he was welcomed by a well dressed young man. He told him that he was going to the University Museum of Classical Archaeology because he has a lot of spare time. After the reception he visited the collection of Greek and Roman sculptures. He then realised that none of the statues in the museum are genuine. He was disappointed by this, but he then realised that the collection is an important part of the university's heritage, and he needed to understand the difference between the two."

One day, I noticed that one of my fellow waiters, a tall older man, was looking at me and not speaking to anyone else. I spotted it quickly. It wasn't a customer but an old man standing in the middle of the restaurant. He saw me scowling. 'That's okay' he said with a grin, while his cigarette dangling from his cigarette holder. 'You're my new man buddy mate.' he said referring to his new friend who had been waiting for a while. He smiled back. 'Wait a minute,' I replied. 'Sure, but he doesn't look nice.' He grinned. 'What does that even mean?' I asked. 'What makes you so darn nice to me?' he smiled again. 'The people who work here seem to be pretty nice,' he smiled back at me.

C1,"Here are some photos of the kids preparing for their space-based experiments. Science is a way of looking at the world. But how does it work in space? That’s exactly what a group of British secondary school students and their teachers did last week in the world’s first ever flight into space. They were able to escape the Earth’s gravity, thanks to a new technology that turns them into floating computers called black boxes. The technology is set to enable the next generation of scientists to study the effects of gravity without having to rely on traditional gravity experiments. The researchers are planning to take some of the black boxes to a lab in the Netherlands. On each black box, four students are wearing the helmets that normally block the sound of sound. That lets the sound wave interact with their brains and let them experience weightlessness for one minute. But first they need to prepare the black box. “The students are all naive,” says one of the Black Box engineers, Simon Taylor. “I told them to sit down and get their headphones out. Then the flight crew told the passengers to turn the headphones off. They do this to give us about two minutes to read the instructions. They need to keep the headphones on. This is a really complex system. These are some of the things that need to happen before we can enter space. We put on gloves, put our arms in a sling, and they put our legs in. It’s very challenging to put on shoes that have no heels,” says Taylor. There are two slings to wear around the neck and the back of the neck for comfort. Those with very little weight tend to have a smaller head and face than those with the most. For the first few hours, the team focused on learning how to control the black box to stay in zero gravity for five minutes. Students got to choose what the black box to use to control its movements. They chose a black box with two rotating wheels, a black box with no wheels, and a black box with one rotating wheel. They lowered the black box into the space and began rotating it back and forth for six seconds. The black box went very slowly from a speed of about 80,000 miles per hour to 40,000 miles per hour. With the help of NASA engineers, the students worked out how to control the box with a control device, which was linked to a gamma camera on top of the black box. At first, the team tried moving the controllers around the black box at around 6,000 kilometers per hour. But when the engineers discovered that the black box was able to control the spinning wheel to move very precisely around its black box, they adjusted the controllers to speed up and slow the rotation. They could change the rotation rate by varying the angle of the wheel. By rotating the wheel, the team managed to keep the black box in the speed they were used to, allowing the black box to move to the speed they needed. Then they moved it back to the rate it was used to. They found that the black box could use more torque to turn the wheel than the black box. After eight hours of flying, the students landed safely in London at the Royal Air Force College. They’re working on a research project to develop new, faster tools for using gravity to defy gravity. It’s all good stuff: for the future, Mumford says, but there are some big challenges to overcome first. He likes this article from Tom Mumford.",The world was a different place. A whole continent seemed like it had gone into reverse. Even the planet itself seemed oddly flat. But it was all thanks to a British jet fighter. Tom Mumford is an investigative journalist and science writer who goes deep into space for fascinating stories.,"But it looks just like another aircraft from the outside: a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. When it was flying a loop over New York, scientists put a pair of small spacesuit-clad people into the craft and turned it upside down, so it sat on the ocean floor. The effect was temporary and the experiment has now been replicated. Until now, however, no human has ever floated in the absence of gravity. Now, scientists in Israel are testing a new theory, which promises to make the impossible possible — in the form of a small spacesuit. The team at Tel Aviv University, Israel’s prestigious Technion, is testing a new way to create a microgravity field that lasts a few seconds. The spacesuit is attached to a tiny robot, which pulls back on a harness, causing it to float. In the lab, the researchers are studying the effect of friction — the creases on a garment — on the body of the person standing in the spacesuit, as the astronauts can see in the mirror. If friction is reduced, the clothing appears to spring back from a person’s body in space. By reducing friction, people can feel a tingling feeling like the body may have moved or wiggled. The researchers have also found that the human body has a greater temperature variation in space than in the ground. While the experiment is still in progress, its aims are clear. “The more friction there is, the slower our metabolism is going to be — that’s where our metabolic rate is set to slow. That means it’s going to slow down and slow down our metabolism,” says Yoann Cohen, who studies food at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Nonetheless, the scientists are convinced their research will be used for more than just medical or scientific purposes. During a few moments of space, the students can see the difference between the amount of pressure on their chests, for example, when they are in a spacesuit, and when they are on the ground. It could make the difference in whether an asthma sufferer can see the air around them in the spacesuit. The team also wants to know why people sleep, particularly if they’re in the spacesuit. “There’s a lot of research showing that sleep is a risk factor in many diseases and injuries,” said Cohen.","... the experience of weightlessness can be challenging, for the most part. Scientists have long known that the way we perceive objects depends on gravity, but to understand how we feel in weightlessness it's sometimes important to look at what's happening inside, too. Tom Mumford, the BBC’s science editor, went on board a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker on a mission to the International Space Station in 2014.... the idea is to study brain activity, something astronauts routinely do in space. They use computers to gather data. It's an extreme test of the brain as a computer — and its effects aren't always the same on earth. The pilot said he built it because of the space station’s unique location and size, in particular the way in which the wings move. But he also said he wanted a more unique type of test. ""So we've had to make sure this plane is as aerodynamic as it can be, and it also has a lot of cargo space,"" he said. The Boeing is one of a number of older aircraft that the astronauts used to spend time in weightlessness. It’s based on the Boeing 747 passenger craft and has been operated by the same company for nearly 50 years. He said it took seven days to fly this plane to the International Space Station. The flight lasted 45 minutes. Before leaving, the pilot explained how astronauts in space walk on two-legged tracks. The idea is that humans have to walk to stay upright in weightlessness, and the jet is powered by an electric motor. And for the first 20 minutes the KC-135 was accelerating at 25,000 feet per hour. “We need to keep the engine to 5,000,” the pilot said. Then he would speed up the engines by increasing throttle and accelerating the aircraft by 100 miles per hour. The idea is to simulate a man walking on two legs by balancing on his toes. He had to make sure he could stand, and his legs did. “They don't have to be very strong,” the pilot said. The plane was about to start its descent when it was stopped by a ridge of high altitude clouds. Those clouds slowed the plane. The pilot stopped to look up at the clouds to make sure the ridge of high altitude clouds did not interfere with the flight. They were there, in time for the students to savor the moment. ""We were all watching television so we were focused on the space station itself,"" Mumford said. “It is very different compared to earth. It is a whole different dimension. To think about it for a second, you have never flown at a height that you have done here before. There is no friction as you have no wind resistance and no gravity.” Using NASA's CLARITY test, the students compared their body weight against different heights of clouds. The tallest cloud was heavier than the smallest, and was moving away from Earth. ""But on earth there is weight on the ground, you have a lot of pressure.... So on the ground that makes the pressure much higher,” said the flight attendant. ""There's also a lot more drag on your body."" While in weightlessness, the students swam at high speeds. ""It's a good feeling,"" one said. ""For the first time in our life you don't feel very heavy."" ""I'm just flying through the air,"" another added. ""Everything is moving very fast, but you don't feel any acceleration."" The scientists simulated the experience of weightlessness by laying down on their backs. ""The best thing we can do is to just sit there and watch it."" The flight was only 10 minutes long. It flew more than 13,000 km between Cape Town and the International Space Station.",The first weightlessness experience ever given by the European Space Agency came to London.,"A group of young people sit in a cramped cabin, strapped to specially designed chairs that they must lean into to keep their weight down. They all look at their phones or tablets to see how it feels. It’s difficult to keep an eye on what’s going on around them. How about the weight on their faces? How do they feel when they’re moving? And what’s the weight on their legs? And how did it feel when they’d fallen asleep? Science teacher Tom Mumford and the students, ages 11-14, have been flying with NASA to a space station in the Pacific called Soyuz. For seven and a half hours, the seven of them would be floating in a tanker called the Soyuz MS-11, which seats 17 passengers on the wing-like spacecraft. The idea is to test various theories about why we’re not weightless. They’ll spend a lot of time trying to keep weight off their bodies. They could take a nap if they wanted to. But it’s possible to move around with little to no support, and in the space station it feels like you’re floating. “The feeling is quite different because you can’t move your arms or legs,” says Adam, 12. “But it’s pretty neat because it lets you feel the force of gravity.” Adam says it feels weird. “Everything’s like you’ve got air under your feet. You can’t walk or eat or stand. You can’t breathe, and sometimes you’re just floating out of breath,” he says. And he and his friends think they have the chance to prove this when they arrive on the space station in a month. It will be the first time any of the students have flown in space, but Mumford says NASA’s mission is to learn how to build a reusable space station. So he’s one of the three scientists taking the students up into the space station. He thinks the experience will be like nothing else. But Mumford says the students could end up doing something else with their life. But he says it doesn’t matter. When they go back home, they’ll probably be able to talk about all of the science they learned. Tom Mumford is a science journalist and author. He's written for the BBC, Forbes and the Telegraph. He has two sons who are both aspiring journalists.","The Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker was built in 1964 to refuel U.S. military tankers, according to the Boeing Company. The plane is in the process of undergoing a refurbishment that should see it re-used for commercial flights in the future. To fly there, it is being modified with lift engines that create more lift and drag, along with the installation of new fuel tanks and electrical systems. The plane was painted a striking green, with a name plate, and a large number of schoolchildren were sat inside on cosy seats, watching television while the pilot, Jim, explained what they were doing. The teenagers, who were aged 10 to 15, were a mixture of students, adults, and grandparents. The teenagers were particularly keen to see how it felt to be at the back of a jet. Jim told them that he used to work as a flight instructor and now was training students and young people. In 2007, the company will begin building the lift engine and installing it, with the aim of eventually being ready for testing on the KC-135 aircraft by 2018."
C1,"In Cannes harbour I was in the middle of a long lunch and I’d been drawing for a few minutes when I saw Picasso. It was a Saturday afternoon and I noticed the restaurant was empty. A young man approached and asked where I was from. ‘Before, I went to see Picasso last year.’ He said yes. He showed me his lunch plate. I pointed and drew his face and a couple of friends of mine, who happened to be local artists, drew Picasso’s face for me. It stayed in my diary for a couple of months. When I got up and saw Picasso, I remembered him in the van, where I spent some years, and I thought to myself he might have been on holiday with someone there in Cannes that day, too. If he was there, I drew him – a very crude but good-quality drawing. He looked up at me.","My life-changing encounter in Cannes in 1961 was a simple fable in art history. I was 8 years old, filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. But at the time I remember it like it was yesterday. Picasso was having lunch on the balcony overlooking Cannes harbour and I was lucky enough to be the only one in the restaurant who noticed. He was in his twenties and clearly much more alert than I. Picasso spoke a little French, but he was a gentleman and his eyes were wide and kind. When he finished eating I asked for a picture of him, and he agreed, with a smug smile. A photograph is only as good as its memories. It was a strange moment and I took it as a sign that it might be my only drawing of Picasso ever. As I sit in my house in Kent I wonder whether my art reflects that moment.","Even seen at a distance eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour, Picasso was instantly recognisable. As the sun disappeared from the sea, the image of him stretched from the awning across the water - and I drew him. I'll never forget the awe in his face: I remember that when he had finished he looked at me and said, ""Frank, I love your drawing of my face. You've got a talent!""",This is a well-written story about the day Richard Cork was 78 years old and saw one of the most revered artists of the century. Read it to see if it catches your attention!,"Picasso drew me for a portrait when I was eight years old. He was eating lunch at a harbourside restaurant in Cannes when he came into sight in 1975. I remember thinking I had just been born to draw. But he said he knew I wasn't an artist. I still remember the day he started laughing when we stopped in the middle of the square for a bit. I was the young Richard Cork, an art history undergraduate from the small seaside town of Gorey in Yorkshire. He was returning from touring France and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van.","I was an 8-year-old student filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. I was standing in the open-air restaurant overlooking Cannes harbour when I suddenly saw a recognizable figure: Picasso. I said, “You’re Picasso,” and began sketching wildly. Almost immediately I felt his gaze, and saw my drawing of his face. That’s when I remembered that I was in the company of a person who had a big impact on my life. My parents were there and I was blown away. “He had an impact on me that will last a lifetime, because he didn’t look like anyone else.” I am still stunned at how I managed to draw Picasso. “It must have been amazing,” Cork tells BBC News. “As you can imagine, I had done a lot of thinking back to it and it is a real achievement. For me, it was a life-changing experience for me and I have never looked back.”","There were many people there, not just Picasso, so I decided to join them. I was a keen sketcher and I knew I had to meet the legendary artist at some point. I drew him quickly, then sat and enjoyed my lunch. Picasso laughed a little, then sipped from his glass of lemonade. The conversation went on, and I was so amazed I said to him “do you know what I want to do?” He looked at me blankly, but still said “Yes!” The next day I was back in England, travelling around Europe and Morocco. My first stop was Cannes. This time I was able to sit down and watch Picasso. I remember being nervous, especially when the artist began to speak to me. When he finished eating, it was obvious that he had been chatting to someone. As a young artist it was not only important to get ahead in life, but also to have the courage to stand alone and meet a genius."
C1,"In the wake of the recession, advertising as a revenue stream is shrinking at a rate twice as fast as the economy. Last year, advertising revenues were $5.4 billion, but now they are just $3 billion, according to the International Advertising Bureau, which keeps track of the industry's revenue trends. This year, a third of advertising revenue is expected to come from new forms of television, radio and print advertising. At the same time, the volume of advertising spending is growing dramatically, according to the newspaper. Many companies are now focusing on direct marketing as a way of building brand awareness. These approaches have become popular because they seem to be the most cost-effective, and they are becoming more effective. But the ad industry will have to adapt to the new realities of the 21st century. That is going to involve developing ways to reach new markets for the products that companies want to sell. The way will require focusing marketing dollars on new markets and to keep the money flowing, sources told the newspaper. ""It has to be about marketing rather than advertising,"" said a manager at an advertising agency in New York City. ""It will take some time, but I believe people will change."" One way to do that would be to do away with advertising for the products that are the most interesting, and to try to find new ways to communicate with consumers. ""New media may change the way we market in the future, but they won't be able to do the same things we do today,"" said Mike Lombardo, the director of advertising at a Boston advertising agency.","The ad industry is suffering from a ""conspiracy of silence."" Its spokesman said ""there is no evidence to suggest that advertisers have found a way to keep up with the pace of economic change."" He said ""it may be true, but it is not the right time for advertising."" The U.S. Department of Commerce reports advertising revenues fell for the first time in 14 years in 1989. Worldwide, advertising declined at a faster pace in 1989 than in any year since World War II, according to new research. Worldwide advertising revenues declined for the first time in 14 years in 1989, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported. ""The rate of decline has been so rapid in recent years that it seems to have accelerated in the face of the recession,"" said Kenneth W. DeFrancisco, director of research at the Commerce Department. ""Advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change."" The spokesman said ""there is no evidence to suggest that advertisers have found a way to keep up with the pace of economic change."" He said the same thing about advertising. ""You can't keep up with the pace of economic change. If you can't keep up, you might as well be dead."" The ad he spoke of was a ""bland, cheap, high-impact, easy-to-make television advertisement for a drug. The commercial ran for more than three minutes and had no text or copy,"" he said. ""So the ad did a lousy job of letting you know about the drug. It had to be a very good TV ad."" ""It wasn't the right time for advertising to be doing that. It was the wrong place to be doing that."" The U.S. Department of Commerce's research shows a lot of money being spent on advertising in nontraditional places. Nearly half of advertising budgets in the U.S., the Department of Commerce reports, were spent outside the United States, compared with half abroad. The amount spent was the same in nearly every country. As the article noted, advertising isn't just about the economy. It has to do with technology. Television and radio were the pillars of the U.S. economy in the eighties and nineties. They grew rapidly in popularity to the extent that the U.S. had the largest ad budget during the entire period. But in the nineties and the early part of the 20th century, TV exploded as a key consumer technology. Its growth was so rapid that the United States spent a third more per capita on TV and radio in the 1980s than it did during the previous eight years. Meanwhile, the cost of television grew at a much faster pace. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, TV was the cheapest form of mass entertainment -- it cost about $1 a week to set up, and about 20 cents a show. By 1980, though, television's revenue had fallen to $46 million from more than $18 million. The two factors of today's ad economy are a combination of technological advances and a shift from advertising as a pillar of the economy to the advertising medium itself.","As almost everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really set in. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. In the past, advertising took advantage of the recession to promote products and services at a time of economic expansion. Today, consumers have moved away from the boom and into recession. So the advertising industry has lacked the ability to promote new, innovative products and services at this time. But the recession has only made it worse. With the general public less and less interested in advertising, advertisers have tried to change things. In a study released today by the National Marketing Institute, Professor Richard Stallman of the University of California at Berkeley found that only 5% of all advertising was effective in generating sales. This number is much lower than the 6% advertising can generate in any other market. This has produced a huge shift in advertising's strategy. Over the last five years, advertising has focused increasingly on mass-market advertising. ""Because it costs so little compared with the other channels, it has become a powerful selling tool,"" says Stallman. ""There is the fact that ads can be extremely effective in obtaining customers and driving sales, but most advertisements are designed to capture the short-term emotions of a consumer, ie 'what now',"" says Stallman. Instead of trying to generate sales, advertising has been trying to get people to buy a product by persuading them to try a particular product. ""Because it's so easy to convince someone to make an emotional choice, it has created a skewed, one-sided message, because consumers are exposed to this message more often."" The idea behind mass marketing, says Stallman, was that of creating a message that was memorable but did not have a lasting effect. Mass marketing meant using all available mediums, including television and newspapers, to sell a product, for example. The idea of mass marketing was one of the cheapest forms of advertising. It was cheaper than buying a newspaper. And advertising was very specific. So the advertising campaign could be very targeted. The consumer would buy a car and if a television advertisement sounded like ""I want that car"" it would be shown on TV, said Dr Stallman. This means that mass marketing, unlike newspapers and magazines, does not have a fixed distribution network. In the old days it was expensive to send ads to a large number of households. Now it costs millions to reach a large group of people. Mass marketing can be much cheaper than advertising but it still has an impact. But mass marketing has made mass marketing clumsy and slow. Mass marketing has made it extremely expensive to reach people. People are now bombarded with advertisements. But because advertising was so costly, television hardly gets a look in, says Dr Stallman. In the future, television advertising will no longer dominate the television landscape. TV is now a relatively small screen. It also offers a much better picture of the market, said Dr Stallman. Television advertising, he said, should make a bigger investment to encourage people to buy more and spend more. That is a key reason why some experts think that if advertising is to survive the current recession, it must adapt to the new world. Otherwise, it is doomed to fail.",New York Times columnist John Higgins examines the decline of advertising.,"'Brexit has made a complete mess of things,' says John Hogg, chairman of the ad agency Macmillan. The ad agency is in financial trouble - its annual sales were less than three billion euros this year, down 33% from the same period last year - and there are fears that the British economy is already shrinking.",The hit and miss of mass marketing. As almost everyone knows advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989 well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.,"A WRITING group warns that mass marketing could kill the industry if it fails to evolve with the pace of technological change. Its chief, Neil King, says: ""I think it is too early to say with any confidence just how big advertising is going to become in coming years. The growth of mass media, from television to the internet, has been dramatic. ""But it is no longer an industry of the past."""
C1,"Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. She had a Kindle, but she had never set it up in her living room until now. Until the day she found an internet-connected Kindle on eBay, she'd never worked from home in any capacity before. But for the past year, she had worked remotely on her day job. But a family emergency had taken her away from the office, and it left her stranded in a house with nowhere to go. Then she saw a Kindle for sale in a clearance sale at an electronics store near her mother-in-law's house in Somerset. ""This Kindle was really cheap. It had a USB port, an SD card slot and a charging pad in the cover,"" she tells Business Insider. ""It had everything you needed to get your writing work done, and I didn’t have to bring a notebook with me!"" The iPad had been waiting in the living room, and her dad had promised to help her set it up. ""It was just the right size and I knew that it worked."" Now she was hooked. ""One of the biggest things, for me at least, was that you could plug in a monitor and a keyboard,"" she says. ""I could see right there and then that I was working at home, in my space. ""I couldn’t believe it. I knew it was possible. But then I saw the price tag."" Now McGuiness works from home at least three or four days a week, and, with the help of her husband, a new website for a family company she owns. She works remotely, though, and works on a laptop, which she finds much cheaper than the desktops she used to work on. And she's always on the lookout for ways to improve her productivity. ""I want to write less, be more productive, and save time,"" she says. ""I think of it more like I would an hourly salary. I always want to be working because I love writing."" And with the smartphone, she finds she can easily keep up with friends and family even from across the world.","Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. When she returned to work for one of the largest newspapers in the world, she felt a sense of nostalgia: she had been covering the events of the day, sat across from the desk from which the news was being reported, watching the headlines and the stories be printed on the front page. As if the world had stopped spinning, she had no idea how to produce compelling work for her readers and that’s why she had decided to get plugged in to new technology to stay in touch with what was happening to her industry. After spending the last 25 years as a journalist at the Daily Mail and Times, McGuiness wanted to go back to her roots and get back to writing about the world and society in general. That desire is what led her to a long, hard search for the right equipment that would allow her to work in her home office and stay connected, both professionally and as a writer. “I saw a lot of homes with people in them and not much of a space for work,” she says. “And the homes were cramped and very noisy and unorganized. So I went to Ikea and bought a new chair, a desk and some electrical items to make it more comfortable, better suited to my needs and to make sure that it was a space I could make work for me, without compromising on the look and feel of the home. I’m in my office now and I can work as much or as little as I want to. My office has an electric lamp, the right height and some of the pieces are very sturdy and very well made. I’m getting really good at designing the space and have a lot of fun doing it. I also use a couple of software tools such as Microsoft Office and Google apps to create, edit and send the newsletter. And the other day, I was in my office and I re-read my latest story. I had been doing so much writing that I’d been ignoring it. A little while ago, I realised that I hadn’t been writing. In my previous jobs, I never had a good idea about what the best ways to write about what was happening to the world would be. I decided that the best way to break free of that feeling was to start getting creative with my workspace. I wanted to make my home the most productive place I could possibly be. It has an electric office chair, which I can sit in and write. I have a nice desk where I can sit down and have a coffee and chat with my editor, Rebecca, as well as with other members of the Media Team and even the CEO, who can give me feedback and help me improve and refine things. I have a kitchen table where I can sit and eat and set up my workspace and a lot of the tools are in here that aren’t in the office, such as the coffee machine and fridge. So I went into the kitchen and sorted out the space that I would use. Then I looked at the electrical equipment and bought a lot of it. I figured out how to buy the things, where to get the parts, how to order things and do things like setting up email accounts and how to make my home more efficient. One of the first things I did was order all the electrical items for me in one order. This made it easier to find the things that I need. When I started putting things in order, I kept to the list as that is what I do all the time. The fridge and a microwave were my main working tools. I use a laptop but I can also do research and write with a tablet. If I have a meeting, I can go into the kitchen and make sure it is well organized before my meeting. I have a good desk and chairs as well that I can sit in and work and be productive. The internet is my work computer. I used to get emails for news stories and e-mails for my business. If it is a story I’m covering, it’s my phone I use for tweeting and Facebook and Facebook, but now it’s my computer. It’s really amazing how technology has made a difference to me.",Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology.

Georgina McGuiness had worked as a journalist for 15 years. During her retirement, she felt frustrated that she wasn’t on the same page as other journalists when it came to social media, email and digital technology. After an extensive and long-lasting search, she discovered that she had forgotten how to be a reporter. She was back on the job, but this time in the city. For the first time, she had a room where she could write, edit and do research. For the first time she was free from the pressure of writing for a magazine. “My time away wasn’t for me to write my next novel or for a feature story. It was to keep up with my work. I just needed to stay focused and not worry about the distractions of work. I did write two novels in three years but I had worked in the industry for most of that time and I was in an environment where I had little opportunity to work independently,” says McGuiness. It was also her first time living away from home. McGuiness says it wasn’t easy to get back into her job, particularly as it was a demanding one. So she decided to create a business from her home. She set to work organising and building her company website as well as creating a social media strategy for its content. McGuiness went from a home full of work-related clutter to one that had become filled with stuff that she didn’t need. She set about making a workspace that made sense to her. She opted for a large, white conference room with a table and chairs and a computer desk. She also bought desk furniture that was big enough to accommodate the laptop and was able to plug in the computers. She also created a home-made space-saving projector and microphone to aid working from home. “This is what made the biggest difference to me personally,” says McGuiness. It wasn’t enough for McGuiness that the business was working. She had to make adjustments to her lifestyle too. The family moved out of the city and when they decided to move home, she was unable to move with them. With only a small wardrobe left, she had to pack her suitcase. She had to throw away any furniture that was still functional and invest in a large desk. McGuiness had to reassess every aspect of her life, including her family’s lifestyle. She also had to reassess her priorities – if she could work from home – in order to get her career back on track. She had to figure out what was working for her and what wasn’t. She teamed up with a professional stylist to create a home office. “She had to think about space, light and everything that was required to make her home a work space and for her family,” says McGuiness. “She had to think about the space that was there for her to set up a computer. And she had to think about the space that was needed for people to use her office. Having a clean, well-functioning home office was a crucial part of the process.","Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. After a long career break from journalism, Georgina McGuiness had to rethink how she would conduct her career. To do so, she needed to make her home an efficient workplace. She set up her office at home and began by putting in a lot of different tech – including a laptop, a wireless printer, a mouse and a few speakers. Georgina set up a small desk for herself in her family room and started using technology. Soon, she was using her laptop to write, and her computer to surf the web. She also started an app on her phone and began an email list for herself. Within months, Georgina McGuiness’ home became an efficient workplace for work and play.","Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism. But even if there isn’t a job in tech for her, there is work to be done – she’s just got to plug in. So she took on the challenge of transforming her family’s home into an efficient workspace. The result: a work desk, an e-mail and internet connection, a printing machine, a telephone and printer, all connected to the same BT line that her husband connects to in the kitchen. To get started, Georgina bought an e-mail account at Gmail.com. Within three days she had an account set up, her e-mail address inserted into the Microsoft Outlook Calendar, and a list of contacts sorted into an E-mail contact group at Google Drive. She also took the time to learn how to use Microsoft Office, in preparation for her job at the Sunday Times. The key to being productive at home was finding the right workspace. “I was working from home and I needed to focus and to work to my strengths. It’s important to me to be able to put in the hours,” says Georgina, who has spent two years in print journalism, and which also includes an online newspaper. Before her work break, she worked as a television reporter for ITV in London. “I always wanted to become an e-journalist. I was used to working in the era of video, and I’d even worked in a small pub!” says Georgina. As for what makes a good workspace, Georgina says she looks for an environment where she feels comfortable working with different styles and people. She says it has to be a space where she can concentrate and still talk with colleagues."
C1,"A pair of young peacocks in a peacock-themed enclosure at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. On a clear summer day, I set off to photograph them. The first peacock is still laying eggs and the second has just returned to the nest after spending the evening laying. The older male peacock hasn’t had a chance to show his pride and his display isn’t quite up to scratch. I try to capture the scene in my memory and don’t want to spoil the experience. I’m focusing on the peacocks as a model – but I also want to show a young female peacock with less pecking power as a potential mate. As with many models, women tend to like more aggressive models but this one was definitely not that. She was quiet but alert, she showed off her beautiful beak and was all ears for a peck. I decided to take her photo and focus on her head. I decided to use my long lens which would enable me to capture the peacock with the most confidence. She held her beak up, gave me a high five and started to walk away before I could snap this shot. There were several images before it came to me that I couldn’t resist sharing. I can’t think of any single solitary moment I’ve ever seen that didn’t start with the peacock. I can’t imagine any of the shots without that expression. I chose to focus on her crest to avoid any confusion with other peacocks and hens in the enclosure. At first I had no idea why the peacock decided to leave the nest and take a flight. She never left the nest. She did not let me take her picture but she did take a walk up to the edge and circle the park. She didn’t seem to mind too much when I asked what she was going to do next. She was ignoring me entirely and was trying to keep pace with the other peacocks. We started off a quick discussion on what was most important for a successful peacock egg: having a magnificent peacock feather and having a hen ready to mate. I think this is one of the most important aspects of their reproductive success. These chicks are at the pinnacle of avian development and are being helped every step of the way. So why are some peacocks still not displaying? I think it’s because they are still in the early stages of development. We need to have a genetically diverse population in order to meet our survival needs. I guess you could say this is the key to peacocks’ survival. I think all peacocks mate with a suitable partner. I just want to be the best peacock egg I can be.","This is a surprisingly informative story which gives you all the facts. A sombre peacock in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, England, stands in front of his hens, revealing the colour and pattern of his body feathers. This tells you how this bird has evolved and why this bird's train is so huge, long and colourful. This is a well-written and engaging story with a nice balance between scientific fact and a nice, poetic tone. This is a well-written story. The description of the peacocks is very clear and the pictures are well-illustrated with appropriate pictures. It is easy to understand the description of the peacocks and the pictures are well-illustrated with appropriate pictures. This is a good story for me, because I like how it talks about how the peacocks have evolved. Throughout this tale, we discover a lot about our feathered friends and about why their bodies have evolved, whereas a similar story might be boring if it was based on stereotypes. However, the stories about the peacocks are also a mixture of the facts and a bit of fiction. All of the information about them is based on the facts that I have learned from reading books, magazines, and on the internet. The writing style is a bit choppy, but this is to be expected in a Grade 2 story, especially when there is some complex vocabulary involved. The plot is enticing and the characters are interesting. There are some nice photos of the peacocks along with some historical information. One of the stories is about the time that there were several peacocks living around an ancient village. This was the last time they were seen. The author, who is now retired, has been very busy. He is also helping to restore the ancient village and this is a great project. One of the stories is about a young girl who falls in love with a peacock and her parents. The peacock is a symbol of love, but it also reminds me that I've lost touch with my roots, which is how it feels to have lost touch with your roots.","My sons have always loved peacocks; as children I would always watch them, and at times I would even sneak inside to watch them perform. But in the last couple of years, they seemed to have grown up in a world in which the birds have become over-pampered, if not completely obnoxious. My son had never really given peacocks a great deal of attention until he arrived at Whipsnade, and he was immediately charmed by their strange appearance. It seemed that even the females were enjoying their show. I watched as they strutted across the grassy lawns - their necks pointing upwards in a deceptively regal manner - while I waited on the other side of the enclosure for them to be able to fly around and perform their act. A short while later, a peacock strutted across the grassy lawns as the sun was setting. As the sun set, my son stared at his father's peacock. Peacocks tend to strut and show their tails for their potential mates. But what makes a peacock strut? Its tail is the most striking feature of its body, and the colour of the feathers, white and buff. A peacock's tail is an extension of the male's neck. Typically, male peacocks have much longer tails, from seven to nine inches, than females. Peacock tails are long and narrow, and the male struts them in the first few days of laying. The tail is a large feathered growth that spans across the length of the male's body, and this growing hair is what makes a peacock so unique. Male peacocks also have a smaller peacock's tail - only about six feet long. This shorter tail allows the bird to fly at a faster rate, because the feathers extend further down the tail, instead of in straight lines. Male peacocks usually strut in groups, each strutting with their tail between their legs. There are several things to be considered in strutting a peacock's tail. One important factor is whether it is a peacock's own responsibility to groom it and to care for it, or is it something that has been taught to the bird by humans? A peacock's tail should only be worn in front of other male peacocks, in an open field. As with all the feathered beauties in nature, the peacock must choose an area where the hair will grow back. It's also possible to have a peacock strut in front of another male, but it is not guaranteed that the peacock's tail will grow back into its original length and form. Alternatively, a hen may strut after its mate in an area where the peacock is not strutting, but only for a short period of time. A hen will usually do this for just two days, and she should then take her time when she's strutting for the mates. She could also strut in the grass in front of other females, and peacocks are not the only peacocks that strut on the grass to perform.","This week on a visit to Whipsnade I was intrigued to see the peacocks as they strutted around the showgrounds. They were so majestic and beautiful. This suited me because I am in love with peacocks. I saw so many peacocks in the peacock section at Whipsnade. I even managed to witness a peacock strutting on a bridge. These majestic birds are very graceful creatures. In an attempt to keep up, I decided to get photos of some of the peacocks during the show. I am so grateful to the Peacock Society for allowing me to shoot some of their photos, which are on my website. This is what I got up to: the pictures show a peacock in full flight. They are all so different - I really liked the different colors. It is easy to understand how hens and peacocks dress. In the final scene of the story, a peacock struts, then jumps into the water. Here at Whipsnade, they make the best of what they have. This demonstrates the diversity of birds in the world. I hope these shots and my story give you an understanding of how birds live together.","When I saw the peacocks at Whipsnade I knew that I had to know more. It was the same in the wild, but here at Whipsnade the peacocks were thriving. The hens had not moved in months, and the peacocks weren't even sure of who was the boss anymore - a lot has changed since I was a child. My father was a farmer who used to work in the local woods and he would take the young boys for long walks through the woods. He would pick them up and carry them about as he saw fit. The hens were not all that interested in him. One day in June last year one of the hens told me the girls at Whipsnade were getting ready to go to the pub. She had just had a little argument with a male peacock. Suddenly I was so aware of the changes in the peacocks, I knew I had to write about them. For once my father was right about the peacocks. In all fairness the hens didn't seem to be interested in me. I had made a career out of it. I was a bird watching officer for the local authority for almost thirty years and I had the chance to watch wild peacocks in their natural habitat. I wondered how this animal could survive in a world where even a single wild peacock can be exterminated. Peacocks are the largest of the raptors. Their wings span up to eight feet and a peacock can have up to 500. The male peacocks have a slightly bigger body but shorter slender legs. These differences in size mean the hens can chase them off. It also means when one hen chases the other all her male counterparts will turn and fly away with a wink. This may seem odd but I can't see it happening. The peacock's wings have feathers in the back of them that are the same colours as the feathers on the hen's feet. At most, the peacock has one eye. This is not good for the males as it might attract unwanted attention. I did learn something by watching the peacocks, I wondered if perhaps the male peacocks had the option to have a long feathered tail. But why would a male peacock leave a hair on his face if he wasn't going to mate? It could make for a great comic story.","Peacocks have become as popular as dogs in some parts of the world but it has not always been the case. It was just before Christmas when a couple of peacocks from Whipsnade Wild Animal Park decided that it was time to let them loose. Now, twenty years later, the hens will still have their say.","The birds that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how, in this competitive world where nature, as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? Charles Darwin said the peacocks had evolved to be so bold and showy. They had adapted in a way that made them show a dominance they thought would appeal to hens and therefore attract them. It would seem that peacocks have had a sneeze reflex."
C1,"Until last week I had the impression that genetics seemed to have been a rather enigmatic and secretive subject, and like a treasure chest full of secret messages, and a mystery whose solution remained hidden for some time. But now it seems like it might be easier to guess: according to a study in the journal Science, our abilities to recognise abstract concepts, and even simple patterns like the position of a crocodile’s feet in a river, are something that had been there for millennia. Yet it turns out there is a new way to discover and use these amazing skills: by combining the techniques of neurobiology and behavioural psychology. In the paper, which was published on 14 September in the journal Nature, scientists found that human minds were uniquely adapted for working with abstract concepts. They said their ability to process and remember visual data made them stand out. By using a technique known as “cognitive mapping”, scientists were able to “interpret” patterns of different shapes and colors, identifying the positions of different parts of the brain in a haptic video, which they then listened to. “We knew that our brain had not fully developed, and it was only later in development that we started to form new neural circuits for recognizing patterns in images and objects. “The brain is not a single integrated entity, which is the case for other animals,” said John Gandy, a researcher at the University of London who led the project. As in any good science experiment, the researchers used video to analyse how participants identified objects and people moving around. A simple map of the brain revealed that people who were “clever” at categorizing shapes and colors also understood their own faces better than others who weren’t. By placing these people in a virtual classroom and teaching them math and basic sciences, they could learn how to recognise shapes more quickly. “The brain is an incredibly complex, highly evolved system, with many complex pieces to it, and we think if we can use it more effectively and quickly, then it can potentially become a truly powerful tool for science and technology,” said Dr Gandy. We can’t explain why people are so good at visual recognition, or why visual language is so useful for speech and language – these are all skills that have evolved over millennia, and which could have been formed – but by combining these skills with training, we should be able to recognise a wide range of subjects and functions. For example, we should be able to understand that a crocodile’s feet would not point toward the ground in a straight line, the same way that we should be able to tell what a crocodile might be doing. For this reason we should also be able to work out where in the brain the brain might store information in addition to words. Using this knowledge we could analyse the brains of groups of people who had good memories, compared them to other groups who could identify specific details, and discovered patterns that had already existed. We might also be able to distinguish between objects made by different people, identifying which objects looked similar. “When we looked at our memories in a large-scale way, there were some surprising patterns which could be detected. For instance, we saw patterns like people were always holding a glass of water before using it for drinking. When we tried to use the glass to drink, it would fill up as soon as you had let it go; there was no need to pause and pour it over again,” explains Dr Gandy. In the future, we could be able to find these patterns in a variety of different materials, allowing us to apply our knowledge to the development of our own biological intelligence.","At only seven million years old, we humans still haven’t had time to develop any different characteristics: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale, whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development.","Is There No Such Thing As Natural Talent? Almost 98 per cent of us share our DNA with chimps and other primates. But we’ve evolved things that differentiate us from them. The ability to speak and understand language, for example, is a key characteristic. But most people have their eyes closed when they’re describing something – something that takes time. That’s why there’s so much interest in finding the things which distinguish humans from other animals. This is a story which was first reported by Daily Mail.","We all have a lot of special abilities, some of them natural and some learned. Many people like to think they have talents that aren’t really theirs, and it’s hard to argue with that. But there’s a common myth that we have to work hard to be special. So what does this mean for a natural talent? A scientist at Columbia University has spent the last three decades looking at chimps to see what’s causing such a wide disparity in human abilities.","When it comes to our natural talents, scientists aren’t quite sure what they are looking for. Scientists have recently taken a look at the genes of modern humans and found that the ancestors of modern humans share 98 per cent of the same genes as chimpanzees. In other words, we still have a lot in common with the chimps. But our biological differences – innate rather than acquired – don’t mean we are incapable of great things, as some people believe. One of the things scientists are looking for is something that can make us stand out from other animals. That is why scientists have been looking at the genes of modern humans. It seemed as though these ancient genes had already evolved into something that was different, but the scientists hadn’t been sure what that something was. So they had to search for it and they came up with something that they call “human-specific” genes, which have developed special abilities and behaviours. They started with a search of the chimp’s DNA and found that about 90% of our genes were the same. “This is how we found that the genes for some human specific traits, for some special abilities, actually appeared very, very close to the genes of chimps,” says Alexey Smirnov, the head of the Human-Specific Research Laboratory at the Institute of Biological Sciences at the Moscow State University. “The question is whether we can use some of these genes to develop the distinct traits we have. There are some genes that have been studied since the early fossils were found and have been shown to be important in the evolution of some of the traits we have. These genes have the ability to make a person smart, to teach them how to think and to solve problems.” The researchers are now trying to build the first computer program that can detect which genes contribute to an individual’s intelligence. “The best way to do this would be to get an extremely large, standardized group of people and run them through a computer test to determine which genes they do or don’t inherit,” says Smirnov. Using a computer to run tests will allow them to check that genes are present in people. To test for the gene “human-specific” in a human, Smirnov used the MIT-developed Human-Specific Gene Hunt (HSG). In this game, an agent called BigGuess predicts whether the individual has the traits or abilities that researchers have defined for “human-specific” traits. If the individual has traits, that is likely to be a person that will be able to adapt to new situations, which would put them at a distinct advantage over other people, as the algorithms can see which traits are the most important and which aren’t. At the end of the game, the software generated five different scenarios for the individual to choose from. Only one of the five scenarios showed the individual with genes indicating more intelligence or more abilities than their opponent. Smirnov is so confident that his program will beat his opponent, he has to prove he has those traits. “You can’t do this without a degree of intelligence,” says Smirnov. In a sense, this project is a big step forward for human genetics. The research was conducted by the National Institute of Health, the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences and the National Institute of Mental Health. The researchers found that people who had the genes required to build the human-specific genes had a 98 per cent chance of being able to use them effectively in their daily lives. By the way, that 90 per cent chance doesn’t include all the genes that go on to make our personality, but if a gene is involved in learning how to solve a problem, this person’s chance of being smart is much higher.","In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees we haven’t had time to develop any differences: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale, whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. How did our minds develop? What did our minds do while we were still encased in skin? How did our brains build in intelligence? Why did we have to learn how to speak? How did the human brain get so smart? How do we use our brains?","In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees we haven’t had time to develop any differences: genetically we’re still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps. On this grand evolutionary scale, whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development."

C1,"It was a clear and sunny day. The mountain was not too high. We could see down to the river below. I thought about this for a long time. My friend told me if we had a plane we could have climbed up to the top as we would have a nice view. I don't mind walking, in fact, I'm quite fine, but I don't like hiking'. I was happy that we could have a little rest. Lenina looked up at the blank rock face again, her eyes filled with dislike again. 'What about the birds?' she asked, suddenly starting to walk towards the river, but she stopped. 'I don't like birds'. 'Aren't they just pests?' 'Why don't they just kill themselves' 'Then I'll find a way'. I looked around the river bank for what I could find. Lenina saw a bird in a tree. 'What about it?' she asked. I looked around the tree for a minute before I noticed nothing. It was Lenina. I looked around the trees and noticed that no-one was around. So I didn't feel like walking any more. Then the bird started yelling at me. 'Let's go' I replied. 'I hate walking too'. 'I hate this,' the bird started yelling. 'I hate this too,' Lenina said, and she started walking away. The bird reached out a hand to stroke Lenina. 'I'll give you some food for me to eat' Lenina sighed, and took some food with her. 'Let's walk this rock face for some time' She sighed. She started walking with her little dog, 'Paw.' Lenina wanted to tell her about how she had lived many years with her father, but she never had the chance. She was happy to get to see nature and animals that she had not seen before. 'I would like to give them some food,' she said. 'My parents died in an accident so I didn't want to get in trouble' 'Maybe I should stay home and take care of things' said her dog, 'I could cook anything I wanted here.' Lenina smiled at her dog, her face looked sad. She started walking the rock face, slowly, without thinking. Finally, Lenina looked up at the empty rock face again. 'I hate walking too,' she said, walking away. She started chuckling, she would rather live that way. Lenina looked back at the tree, and then turned back to the river below. ""What about the birds?"" asked Lenina, and she asked. Lenina said, 'I wish we could have brought the plane.'","Lenina wanted to go back to her home. Her parents had promised her to come with them, but she wanted to be able to walk home. So, they decided to walk down the path they had taken to get here and make it to the village. They reached the village and Lenina handed her keys to the girl who had told them the story, telling her not to say anything to anyone else. The girl also told Lenina to follow her and said she would make sure they got back there before they got tired of walking. She also told Lenina to stay the night. They reached their home, where they were greeted with much joy.",I have the most lovely daughter in the world and so do my friends. She loves her parents so much I don't want to upset them. I hate...',Lenina hates walking. It terrifies her to see the view. She looks up at a blank rock face and sighs with sadness. 'I wish we could have brought the plane.',"I'm sorry Lenina I can understand your anger but can you describe how the hike is going and why you feel it is hard?'. 'Driving in such a mountainous landscape is challenging' she said. 'It is not an easy task. We need to look for food.' She added. 'We had to move so fast, the trail looks really steep, we need to be strong if we want to conquer this mountain'. We could not help feeling angry. 'Then I will try to learn'.","'I wish we could have brought the plane', Lenina thought. ""You guys are so stupid! I hate walking!"" As she continued, ""I feel sick. I wish you would get the plane!"" 'But we can't buy one because they're already sold out!"" Lenina groaned. ""But we can bring a friend to fly us to the top!' said Lenina. Lenina looked down at the trail pointing to a cave she thought was going to be the best way to reach the top. 'You two are really stupid!' shouted Lenina, pointing to the cave's entrance. Lenina looked up with disgust and said, 'Now I really don't want to do this.'",I wish we could have brought the plane' said Lenina looking up with dislike at the blank rock face. 'I hate walking.' 'I hate walking' said Anna looking up with dislike at the blank rock face. 'I hate walking.' 'I hate walking.' Anna looked up with dislike at the blank rock face. 'I hate walking.'
C1,"According to the CDC, Americans chew about 31,000 tons of gum a year. Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. The gum that makes your favorite music, movies, games or any other form of entertainment has become a mainstay of America’s cultural landscape. That’s why an article published earlier this year in Business Week described chewing gum as “the last gastronomic frontier.” But gum culture, as the article describes it, dates back to ancient times. “Gum was a natural supplement to our diet that enabled us to eat a lot of healthy foods. It became an integral part of the everyday. It was a good source of calories and fiber. Most people thought that it was unhealthy, but it has many health benefits,” said a report, titled “Eating Sugar Free, Gum as a Lifestyle Choice.” In other words, chewing gum isn’t bad for you. You aren’t even in danger from some of the more common side effects like bad breath or dental plaque. Chewing gum can also be a gateway drug into drugs. “When people started chewing gum, the FDA took an interest in this industry,” said a FDA official. Today the agency studies a wide range of things related to chewing gum, including whether it causes cavities or is harmful for your health, and the products are classified as “junk food,” or not. Those are standards, even though there are no food safety studies about chewing gum. The most well-known example of a regulated food is ketchup, which has the potential to cause stomach ulcers. In 1997, the FDA tested three different brands of ketchup to determine whether they could cause stomach upset, and found none. Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. The Food and Drug Administration, which enforces food safety regulations for food, is also responsible for regulating cosmetics, and because of that there are other food and drug standards, such as the definition of “containment.” (It is also a violation of the Public Health Service’s standards for the sale of tobacco products.) It requires all chewing gum to be in its original state of dissolvability. Chewing gum has been produced in this state since the 1800s and is generally considered non-toxic — but chewing gum contains over 300 substances including tar, trichloroethylene, xylitol and cyanide. Chewing gum was traditionally marketed as a sweet, a chewing aid and a delicacy, but the invention of modern chewing gum radically changed that: The candy can be used to soothe mouth ulcers and as a tooth filling. It comes in a variety of flavors and is sold in a variety of shapes, including sticks, sticks with gummy bears or gum puffs. Chewing gum is not a form of chewing tobacco. It contains only as many calories per stick as candy but much fewer calories. “By using the right ingredients and producing chewing gum that tastes as good as it looks, you can keep the appeal of chewing gum without being high in calories,” said a health expert. Chewing gum is a good source of many vitamins and minerals, including potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and more. People who chew gum tend to eat more fruits and vegetables, less meat and lower in the bad fats in foods like dairy, poultry, fish, soy beans and beans. Chewing gum has also been shown to lower bad cholesterol and increase HDL (good) cholesterol. If you want to lose weight, chewing gum, whether on an empty stomach or during a strenuous exercise routine, is a great way to reach your goal. Chewing gum has also been shown to help adults feel less stressed, sleep better and have better mental health.","Chewing gum has long been a part of the culture. Ancient cultures used chewing gum as a way to get rid of odors and freshen breath. It became fashionable – but when chewing became a big business, so too did the advertising industry that sold it. Today, over 12 million pieces of gum are consumed every day in the United States. And chewing gum is a highly lucrative business. It’s estimated that chewing gum generates about ten percent of all U.S. income. Gum is made from a number of different ingredients. However, the main ones are sugar and glucose, which help to produce gum’s characteristic flavor. In fact, chewing gum is considered the third most popular sweetener worldwide. For people with diabetes, gum is a natural way to fight off a sugar craving. The FDA classifies gum as a food, and must follow standards that ensure that all the ingredients are as safe as possible. But this makes chewing gum a source of controversy: It’s a food product in a country where people are allowed to indulge in non-food substances without causing any health risks. Many countries also have different rules. However, according to the FDA, chewing gum is a popular product with kids. There are about one-fourth of a million children who chew chewing gum each day. Chewing gum is not a healthy food and some people may have a sensitivity to chewing gum. For example, some children are allergic to the sugar that’s in chewing gum. And those who are allergic to other ingredients in chewing gum may want to switch to gum that’s sugar-free. Chewing gum manufacturers are working to make chewing gum a healthier snack option. However, the United States has fewer than 30 chewing gum manufacturers. The other 40 have been producing gum for more than 100 years. A small majority of these manufacturers are family-owned businesses. The FDA’s main purpose in banning chewing gum is to prevent tooth decay and diseases such as obesity. By classifying chewing gum as a food, the FDA ensures that the industry can control the taste, appearance and texture. The FDA’s goal is to keep people from over-consumption. Chewing gum can be a healthy activity to encourage dental health, so many people are doing it. It is also very addictive, as chewing gum gives pleasure to the tongue and mouth. It is also a popular treat and a source of calorie-free pleasure. Chewing gum is also extremely convenient and cost-effective. Consumers can grab one in a store or in a vending machine. Chewing gum can be sold in convenient packs of small squares, which are ideal for children. Or, smaller individual packs can be resealed and sealed again. However, the FDA’s primary purpose in banning chewing gum is to prevent tooth decay. If a child is regularly chewing chewing gum, dental health problems are very unlikely. It’s possible that chewing gum will lead to dental disease.","Chewing gum is both a social and a cultural phenomenon that has found a way to enter the English vocabulary. Americans chew 12 million sticks of gum a day and chew it in different forms. The most popular is chewing gum which is sold in coloured packs and refilled in containers. But coloured chewing gum is not only a modern trend – it's a cultural one. Chewing gum is a product that was once restricted to the mouths of the rich and famous, mainly men, and is more widely enjoyed among children. There was a time when chewing gum was thought to be a luxury, a luxury even of gods. But a survey of over 2,000 adults conducted in the UK, the US, Germany, France and other countries suggests that more than a third of people consider chewing gum a luxury compared to drinking coffee or smoking a cigarette. There is a growing desire to replace some of the bad aspects of this culture. In some cases, people consider chewing gum to be a form of entertainment. The popular cola brand Pepsi, for example, claims to be the world’s most popular flavour of gum. Gum culture has become a major part of American culture, from the movie “Chuck” to the TV series “Monsters Inc” starring Robert Downey Jr and Kristen Wiig. But it doesn’t stop there. It’s an important part of American culture, helping to promote positive feelings ranging from the idea that chewing gum can boost your mood to giving you an energy boost.","Chewing gum isn't a thing of the past, but as the new report explains, it’s become a big part of American culture.","Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick but it is classified as a food by the American Food and Drug Administration. The agency also requires chewing gum to comply with the labelling and ingredients requirements. That’s why the gum on your desk today might be as long as a football pitch, but it is still safe to chew and is popular with kids. It doesn’t have to be pink, green, or minty. In the British capital, London, we like to be different to the kids we meet. If we’re out shopping, we prefer to look the part with gum in our mouths. Even if we’re just having a conversation, we like to put some in our mouths. It’s not that we want to look ridiculous with it. We don’t want to look like an idiot because we chew gum all the time. But there’s more to it than a smile on your face, a quick peck or a flash of brilliance. Gum culture began before we were even born and, by the time we reached our teens, it was a big industry with a huge social impact. In the US, it was banned as food back in 1934 because it could cause obesity or tooth decay. In Australia, cigarette smoking is banned as it can cause lung cancer, and in the UK, chewing chewing gum has triggered public health concerns. It’s not just the health issue. It’s that gum can be addictive. And if someone starts to chew the wrong type, they may develop a habit. The most addicting type of gum is sugarless gum. While chewing sugarless gum may taste more artificial, the effect is that your lips feel dry and they won’t want to bite or swallow anything. So why do people chew gum? Some argue that it gives them a refreshing sensation. It’s probably not the caffeine but the sensation that it gives. According to researchers at Duke University, those with lower levels of caffeine (those below 60) don’t necessarily find it as relaxing. Those with high levels of caffeine experience a heightened sense of pleasure after chewing gum. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, for example, has found that chewing gum makes a person feel refreshed faster. Some gum brands claim to make people think they’re drinking more water, which might be a false marketing claim. While you should definitely drink more water, there’s no evidence to back it up. People are less likely to chew gum if they have low blood pressure. And that’s the crux of the problem. In the United States, chewing gum is considered by the American Food and Drug Administration as a “recreational drug,” which means it must be sold for use by children. In fact, chewing gum should not be sold to children under eight years old. But children shouldn’t eat gum. It could cause respiratory problems. The same applies to chewing it on a roof, for instance. And chewing sugarless gum can cause problems with heart disease. Those at higher risk tend to chew the gum first thing in the morning. The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that it’s best for children to chew on a sugarless gum. It could also prevent tooth decay. But you can see how it can’t be good for children. Is chewing gum bad for your teeth? If that’s your concern, check out this article from The Washington Post. The Washington Post has an excellent review of gum that you can find here.","The term “chewing gum culture” is not just a recent phrase. In fact, the term first appears in a chapter in the book on American sociologist Edward James Olmos’ book “Chewing in America.” It was published in 2001, and Olmos describes a societal movement that began in the 19th century with social historians who questioned how many people used chewing gum as a way to break the monotony of their daily lives.","The history of chewing gum has never been lost on historians. In ancient Egypt, gum was believed to help cure coughs and prevent disease. The Egyptians would cut pieces of chewing gum into slivers and then chew it over the mouth, leaving a small stain. This technique became popular around the middle of the nineteenth century as people became more aware of the health advantages of avoiding bacteria in the mouth. Chewing gum is now popular in all parts of the world. In a survey by the British Council, researchers have discovered that Americans chew 67 million sticks of gum per year. This is equivalent to a population of 2.2 billion people. A survey by the University of Colorado showed that gum has become the most popular snack in America. In Japan, gum is a popular source of energy and it is an important source of nutrients in the body. Gum-chewing was associated with childhood obesity and bad teeth and teeth, but it has come back in fashion. Many people now consider chewing gum to be a form of therapy as people have found it can help with tooth pain."
C1,"With a new book just two months away and no money to be found he is not one to be outdone, but still struggling to make ends meet. When Nicholas Evans was just a tad over 21 he was working as a screenwriter at a production company. He also had his own personal problems to deal with, including being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and finding out his father had died. His family had been devastated but he said, despite all the negativity, it was the hardest time he'd ever had. “My dad died and a lot of us thought it was going to be hard to get through the year.” That was then and this was now. Now he's got a new book and he's not stopping there. But after all that he's still not quite ready for a break. He hasn't told his wife about his success yet but she's hoping to become a writer. Now for the first time she wants to speak to him about it, and to give him time to recover. The Horse Whisperer is his first novel, but it's not the first book he's been writing. He's written seven short stories, the first of which has been short-listed for the Man Booker Prize. Before The Horse Whisperer was published the first book he wrote had beaten him to it. He had been thinking about it for more than a year but had not decided whether to publish it. So when the author of his previous novel, The Dog Who Wouldn't Die, launched it as his next project and became the highest-selling book of 2011 he decided to finish it. ""It was a lot of hard work,"" he says, ""and I had to do it in my sleep."" It's a solitary task, for sure, but he was happy to get out of bed. And with that in mind, he decided to do it as fast as possible. He told his girlfriend that if they loved the book and his story that he would publish it within 24 hours. The next day, the next day, the next day. And so on. It took him two and a half years to finish it and this time he's squeezing every last ounce out of it. The book took on new significance as he had written it as the basis of his screenplay, a movie script and a television series. Before he wrote the book he wrote scripts for the film The Hunger Games and his brother's Christmas Day wedding. At the same time he was developing The Dog Who Wouldn't Die and the show. The novel was also inspired by the TV series Downton Abbey, but he says it was really just a chance to write something for that show. ""The Horse Whisperer is a story about loneliness."" A long time ago he had a friend who asked him if he wrote any screenplays. He was asked to do the research on an early version of the book. At the request of a producer at Paramount, he then came up with the idea. He knew that the TV series version would be more personal and the book would be more about learning a skill and understanding horses. ""So I had an idea for a book for the book and I wrote it. Then I realised there would be a big audience for it,"" he says. ''I said, ''I'm going to write this.'' It didn't look any different from the book. I'd come up with the idea and he said, 'I love this idea,'' so I started working on it."" Before he started writing the book he had spent a week in a horse hotel, working with an international team of horses. When he began writing the book he didn't know what the book would be about but he had an idea and he wrote it. ""It's not a book about horses. The book is about friendship and healing. It's about dealing with grief. And it's about a man's struggle to find a meaningful way of life."" ""It's about losing yourself and trying to find happiness. It's about finding yourself again and being an individual.""","Nicholas Evans's novel, The Horse Whisperer, was the hottest book of the year before it was published. Even before it was published The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year, a first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans. It has earned its author record-breaking sums. Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year, a first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans. Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year, a first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans. Until the book was published, it had earned its author record-breaking sums. Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, the book quickly became the hottest book of the year. It was the first novel in a series written by Evans, called the Horse Whisperer Chronicles. During a break from writing to spend time with his horse, he began dreaming of having his own horse, but said he was never going to do that. A year later, The Horse Whisperer became the hottest book of the year. At first it was a very small book, just over 2500 words, but in the end it became a bestseller. It was so popular that Amazon.com reportedly bought two million copies. At the time, the booksellers had to spend a further half-billion on marketing and promotion for the book. After that, it was the book that broke the record for the number of copies sold in a single month. The book has had its own movie adaptation. In March, The Horse Whisperer opened in the United States at No. 1 on the box office chart. Its sequel, The Horse Whisperer: On the Road, was released the same month. The film was so popular that one day, a week after The Horse Whisperer was published, the New York Times announced that the book was being made into a movie. That film was The Horse Whisperer: The Hidden Life of Timothy Green. After the success of The Horse Whisperer, Evans says he started to write The Horse Whisperer. The story was inspired by the real-life adventures of American businessman David Copperfield and his horses, which are portrayed in the book. During the book, Copperfield worked in a meatpacking plant. One day, Copperfield asked him to help bring a shipment of cattle to the North Pole for shipment in 1895. Copperfield told the British film director Michael Winterbottom that he wanted to make a film of Copperfield and his horses, but he wouldn't agree to the role of the horse. When the film was ready, the book was the easiest thing in the world for him to write. The book took two years to get published. Currently, it's been in the No. 1 bestsellers in the UK for four months. When The Horse Whisperer was published, the paperback version was selling for just under £400. Today, The Horse Whisperer: On the Road is at No. 1 on the bestselling book charts on the UK iTunes store. It has sold more than 205,000 copies in all, and has climbed the U.S. Top 20 for the past six months. Nicholas Evans believes that his book is now the hottest book of the year. ""There is a tremendous amount of popularity. People talk about the book, about its success in the movies and other aspects, all over the world. I don't think it's been an instant hit. What are people saying about The Horse Whisperer that isn't just about horses? It is about the people, the people on the book, that are drawn to the story,"" he said. Although the book is available in the US, The Horse Whisperer has just had its theatrical release in the US on November 28. Evans says that it will soon be on sale in other countries.","Nicholas Evans was a budding author who had spent his first months of 2016 writing a screenplay that had no hope of being made into a Hollywood movie. His first book was destined to be just that but his book The Horse Whisperer was going to change his life forever. So how does someone who started out this way go from being a novice at filming a story that was not going to get a film to becoming a superstar? Well, after reading the first page of The Horse Whisperer it was obvious that this would be a great story. The plot follows an orphaned horse named Charlie who lives with his foster parents as a cowboy. But despite all the bad fortune, he finds a way to survive and thrive on his own in the wild. He teaches Charlie how to ride and shows him how to take risks that pay off. He uses his skills to make a living chasing horses and doing stunts but he hasn’t forgotten his roots. He is also a huge fan of the natural world and believes it’s where the great stories take place. So why did he decide to write his first book? Well, I had just started a script for an Academy Award-winning film called The Boy Who Harnessed Horses and had never written a screenplay before, which is a strange thing for me to say. To tell you the truth, I haven’t even written a script since the first few years of university when I started out. But then I found a job as a screenwriter and wrote the screenplay that won an Academy Award. But I then had to learn how to write a script with no plot, or nothing really to show on screen. There were no script notes or anything to explain the story at all. It was just my name in script form, no background whatsoever, no history. So I sat down and wrote that script. So that’s how it all happened. I was desperate to write this book. I felt like all my luck had run out, and I needed to write it now. As he puts it: “I’m only 29 but I’m a huge success”. But the pressure of turning his first book into a Hollywood hit took its toll. Then around the end of 2015 I saw an article on Time magazine. It featured a cover with the words: ‘The Horse Whisperer is destined to be a big hit’ and he said that this was exactly the kind of book he had been looking for. So I sent it off to publishers in the US and Canada. The response I got was amazing, and I knew they had it in them. It was then that I began researching the book. And when the book came out I immediately ordered a book trailer. I had no idea what kind of book I was going to write, but I felt I needed to write something. I started writing an outline and a storyboard. I had an idea, but I didn’t know how to write it. I think the way to write an exciting book is to get people excited. I would write as long as possible and then I would write a few chapters at a time. There were three or four people that had read it a long time ago, and I just kept the writing going, because people liked the book. I just kept writing. Eventually it landed on a screenplay by the name of The Horse Whisperer. It was a tough process, but the film turned out very well. So I thought it would be a good idea to just do the book, but I didn’t want to take too long. The Horse Whisperer was published in October 2015 and it became the bestselling book of the year – at the expense of dozens of other books. When I finally finished it it was the fastest-selling book of all time and it is still a bestseller. I’m delighted about that. But the best part of it is that I have also made a good living at writing screenplays. So it’s not like I’m trying to go back to the beginning. I have an idea for a film and I’m still writing. But the horse whisperer is definitely a book that people will have read by now, maybe even before. Nicholas Evans had an interesting career as a screenwriter, producer and director, but also as a philanthropist – and he used his success to pay his way through university. In the early 1980s he started making art, selling t-shirts and mugs, and selling cars and tractors. For a decade he ran his own successful studio","The Horse Whisperer has pushed the British film industry into an exciting new phase as it attempts to capture the equine spirit in both movies and books. In Nicholas Evans first novel he gives us a picture of his family and life during a particularly difficult period. Before The Horse Whisperer was published his life was complicated. He was a horse trainer on a very small Yorkshire estate, but he had to make some radical choices as he went along: he dropped out of a university film program and spent almost a year and a half in a London psychiatric hospital. In the midst of all this, Evans was writing his first book. It was to be his first and only novel. He pushed all his friends and family into a corner, hunkered down on the couch and wrote. He wrote his first draft in a couple of months. And then, while he was still struggling to keep up with the demands of his writing life, a friend of his father, who was a former racing trainer, came to his rescue and encouraged him. The rest, as they say, is history. Despite his family tragedy Evans managed to get his first book published, despite his father's opposition. The Horse Whisperer was published in April this year, and it's the hottest book of the year. Even before it was published, it was a record-breaking bestseller, earning him record-breaking sums. Since the book's publication, Nicholas Evans has gone on to make a career out of his books and film directing. In 2001, Nicholas Evans won an Oscar for best screenplay. He says that's one of the most rewarding accomplishments that's ever come his way. Nicholas Evans and his family aren't surprised that The Horse Whisperer has become a commercial success. ""You see, in the beginning of the year we were just trying to keep going. We wanted to get it published as soon as possible,"" says Nicholas. ""And we were really going for a certain outcome. The story was a really interesting story. It's about a man who gets his horse so that he can teach it a lesson. I think it was a very exciting project and I'm really glad it's been a success."" Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, it has earned its author record-breaking sums. In fact, by the end of the year, his first book, The Horse Whisperer, had already been adapted into several movies. A hugely successful and popular first novel has been published, and it is now being made into a movie. It is now about to become a movie. But you can’t stop there. After that comes the next hurdle: The book needs to be turned into a book that can be published. ""It's always a difficult task for a first novel,"" says Nicholas. ""But after The Horse Whisperer was published it was a massive success and I thought that it would go down as one of the best books I've ever written."" Nicholas says that when he started to write The Horse Whisperer he had always wanted to be a writer. ""I never thought that I could become a novelist,"" says Nicholas. ""For me, writing is a process of learning from mistakes and getting a bit better. When I do become a writer, I'm a published author, and that's very important."" In terms of the publishing process, Nicholas says: ""I was trying to keep my first novel as simple as possible, which meant that the idea of creating a book wasn't as daunting as it might seem. It was quite straightforward."" His success was a culmination of his life's work and his dedication to being a good writer. ""I had to be honest when I realised it was going to happen. In fact, I never believed that it would happen in the way it did. I just kept writing and, just as things come together, the book came about. There was some difficulty figuring out what I was going to do next."" There is a similarity between Nicholas Evans and the movie The Horse Whisperer. It took him seven years to write. One of them was writing the script for The Horse Whisperer. ""It was a hard time but I just kept writing. It was very difficult to get the book published. I think that's because I needed to get it published because, in my mind, it was going to take","In January 2005, it was Nicholas Evans’s turn to be cold and lonely. He’d worked at a pub in London’s Clapham Common, a job that he hated. He’d just graduated from university, with a 2:1 (Masters degree + honours) and was aiming to set up a publishing company. But his luck was not good. It took months of rejection letters and months more of cold rejections to get his first book published, in The Horse Whisperer. And this was before the launch party. The book was called the World’s Most Coveted Book. Within a few weeks, its Amazon.co.uk sales had soared to a staggering 730,000 copies, with a worldwide success rate of 37%. But when the book hit its second week, the sales slumped. That’s when the publisher, Simon & Schuster, stepped in, agreeing to publish it for a mere £10. It went on to become one of the biggest-selling books of all time, selling 200,000 copies worldwide in just two weeks. A week after it was released, it hit the charts in the UK with a sales figure of 185,000 copies, confirming that it was the ‘must-read’ book of 2013. Nicholas Evans explains how his inspiration for The Horse Whisperer came about: It started when I was writing The Man With the Golden Gun. I was writing a screenplay of the book about the adventures of a small boy, called Ben, who goes to a farm with his family to beg some of his stallions to look after him when his dad dies. The stallions are all so poor, they live on tin cans that he can’t afford a stable, so he goes there to restock. He’s inspired to write this book, partly because he has always been surrounded by stallions and partly because he’s always loved them. He didn’t think it was such a brilliant idea, that the stallions had such power to change people’s hearts, but there was something magical about having a big, beautiful, noble animal that can transform people. And so The Horse Whisperer was born, a book that turned into a movie. The film was made in just over a year, and The Horse Whisperer was made into a movie in just six months. He says: After the success of the first book, it was a complete natural for me to go and write the movie. It was like a godsend. It’s just like it was meant to be. I had this vision of a horse that would transform people’s lives. A book that could transform anyone’s life. I’d write a book about a horse that was going to change the world - I think it had to change people’s lives. It was a simple idea, really. I was a complete nonbeliever in horses. I didn’t know there were any and I didn’t think there were many people out there who were as passionate about horses as I was. And that’s when I came up with this book. You see, I’m a bit of a nerd - at least with horses - and I wrote The Horse Whisperer in the evenings. I used to read it to myself before bed. After the success of The Horse Whisperer, I decided to write a novel about my own experience of trying to break into Hollywood. My idea was to write it for myself and to sell to publishers, I thought. Then I thought, I haven’t written much in a long time. So I got into my studio and wrote the book. It took three months, but it was worth it. I had an agent who gave me some good leads on publishers. I contacted them, and three days later they called back to tell me they had picked it up, and wanted to get in touch with me. The book was published a week later. I think that probably makes it a little easier than some people’s experiences were - I had the freedom to decide where my book was going, and that was important. Now it’s a bestseller.","When the Horse Whisperer was published in November the book became the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, the book earned him recordbreaking sums. Now, the book has won three Oscars - Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay - and has been made into a Broadway musical. But the story had begun years ago, long before Nicholas Evans became a Hollywood big-wig. When he was a child, he dreamed of becoming a jockey. Now the book is based on that dream and is a best-selling book. ""It was an amazing book,"" Nicholas said. ""I've been working on it since November and it was the only thing I had for six years."" Before the book came out, Nicholas worked as a journalist at the Sunday Times. It was then that he decided to write a book. ""The first book I ever wrote was called The Little Prince. And it was a very slow process,"" he said. ""I wrote a 50,000-word story about a boy who grows up in a village, and by the time he is fifteen he can ride a horse."" The book was the winner of the New York Times Book Review Prize, one of the top literary prizes. But the book took about six years from the time the idea for the book first started to nag him. ""I was trying to write about a very emotional experience,"" he says. ""It was also very much about the process of making the book. ""It was very hard. There were so many issues. It was extremely painful and there were some really difficult moments that I spent hours and days dealing with."" Then, in March 2009, the book hit the bestseller list and went to number one in three countries. ""People who love horses read it, and they loved the book. This story has been so successful that there's a new movie. And it is really exciting, because we have never had a book that has been so successful as a book."" ""It was one of those experiences where you wake up in the middle of the night and realize that this is going to happen. When I started it was an absolute shock, so it was a surprise to a lot of people. The book has been a huge hit in a lot of countries,"" says Evans. ""It's been so well received. It seems to have resonated with a lot of people.""","Nicholas Evans had to overcome severe selfdoubt before his novel The Horse Whisperer was published. And he had to learn to accept his defeat. On one cold, rainy night in the middle of December, he and a team of six horseriders drove through a forest to an abandoned farm in Gloucestershire. While the weather blustery and cold, the horses looked as if they could have fallen into the icy water. But as he approached the farm, Evans said to the horses, ""Wait a moment - I think I may be dreaming."" Despite the challenge, the horses responded in a calm, friendly manner. He drove home alone. It was a week before Christmas, so there were no lights, and the road was damp and foggy. ""You might like it,"" he said. ""I'd been driving like that for a very long time. I didn't know it was foggy because it was snowing!"" he added."
C1,"Tamburlaine the Great marries a fanciful melodrama with a rapacious machismo, but the effect is that its overlong run time is no longer a deterrent. Playwright Terry Hands has created a theatrical spectacle that does not feel strained. It is a spectacle that demands the full participation of the audience. In a play that has never escaped the label of “romantic comedy,” the machismo of Hands’ Tamburlaine is a feat not achievable by any modern stage director. It is the eponymous king who is crowned with a great crown and his troops enter battle as the greatest kings of England. But, unlike Marlowe’s hero, this is no play for everyone. There are scenes which will undoubtedly appeal to some, but there are scenes too wild, lurid, or just plain vulgar to be taken seriously by most modern audiences. And Hands has incorporated these scenes into his production. His character ebbs and flows across the stage, causing the chagrin of the audience as he falls to his knees, or leaps up and down on stage like a ballet dancer, or falls off and then returns to the stage again and again. These scenes are often unsettling, but sometimes necessary. Hands’ performances are so compelling that, if one is ready to sit back and enjoy this spectacle, the audience can feel that they are witnessing an adventure. With only one actor, Tim O’Brien plays Marlowe’s chariot racer, King Tamburlaine, but it is his physicality that keeps you hooked. Hands uses the two horses onstage (Benedict and William). The pair act as Tamburlaine and his servant. O’Brien looks a little frightened at first but his comic timing is spot on and he gives a commanding portrayal of the cruel king. The scene where Tamburlaine and his companions are brought to heel is a standout and he makes his lines seem utterly natural. In another scene, Tamburlaine is forced to fight his opponents, who are made up of servants, in an attempt to bring some order to the battlefield. The first time Tamburlaine sees the young prince, he flings him into the air and is confronted by a resentful Duke. Tamburlaine is about to kill the Duke and then the Duke, when the Duke attacks Tamburlaine’s tent and kills him and his men. He falls onto the ground, his body dripping blood. He then kills the Duke and his men and rides off. However, he is killed by the Duke’s men when Tamburlaine shoots them and flings him into the crowd. Tamburlaine is then able to fight his opponents head on. By the end, the audience feels that they have been involved in an action packed, thrilling and violent spectacle. The finale of the evening includes a fierce fight with the Duke. The final scene of the night begins with Tamburlaine beating up the Duke. He goes off stage to reveal that he is carrying a sword, a sword which is wrapped around a spear. As Tamburlaine is preparing to head off on another epic journey, the audience cheers him on, calling out “Tamburlaine the Great!” and his army arrives. It is a sight and sound that will leave audiences speechless. Hands’ production is not a sappy, sentimental piece of entertainment, it is exciting.","Tamburlaine the Great plays the Charles Spencer Theatre until Saturday, July 1.","A. Terry Hands’ Tamburlaine the Great, which opened at the Charles Spencer Theater in London earlier this month, is one of the best plays ever written. The play has eloquence but Hands’ interpretation, with its relentless pacing and abrasive acting, is a triumph. B. The actor with whom I spoke with had some good insights into the role. C. The production has given me a feeling of the play’s origins. D. He said, “I’m not sure if anybody has ever looked at the text and read the play. I thought it was the work of Shakespeare – Shakespeare is such an ingenious playwright.” A. I was so pleased and so thrilled to see Hands’ play – Marlowe’s ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior – in a brilliant stage production. It was the first time I saw a production of Tamburlaine the Great in Britain. It had been a long time coming. B. It was a long way off. C. It was almost too good to be true. D. The performance was of such a high standard that I almost wrote it off as too good. The first half of the play is a twilight zone, a whirlwind and in a way quite painful. The story moves very slowly. A couple of people stand in the wings to cheer him on. One person says, “What’s a twilight zone?” There are so many people doing all sorts of things. A couple of the actors stand in their bathers. Several men are chasing the main characters and jumping into the fight. One man jumps into a swimming pool. One man holds a sword high above his head. One man reaches up and grabs a crowbar. All the characters are shouting and trying to yell to the crowd to cheer and cheer and cheer. When they do, Tamburlaine runs in and screams back. D. When the play finally starts, it’s as thrilling as ever. The only time I would leave the theatre would be if one of the actors would give up. C. I loved the dancing at the end. D. Some of the dancers were so good that we were dancing as a team. D. Some of the dancers did a great job but others didn’t do enough. E. It was very exciting to see everyone trying to keep up and make the dancing last. B. It was a great experience to see all the talented performers on stage. C. It was a great idea and a great production. D. There were some clunkers but everything sounded natural and the pace was perfect. C. Tamburlaine was a great role model to me for many years. D. I’ve always loved Marlowe so I always enjoyed seeing him in a production and it was great to see Hands’ version.","After a long, tedious day, the cast was eager to show off a little of their talents in a show full of action-packed scenes and gruesome murders. On Friday night, Theatre Charles Spencer’s production of Tamburlaine the Great arrived – and the audience was right. Terry Hands’ staging, in his uncompromising “meat and blood” staging, offers a feast of combat scenes, a series of fights that rival the most thrilling sports of all – jousting. The audience was taken on a whirlwind tour of warring cities – battles of the senses, of the mind, and of the spirit, with rapiers, swords, spears, shields, daggers, and a swordfight that involved the use of all four arms – sabers, axes, and swords. The actors in Hands’ production are unmistakably martial, their fights ripping through the ranks of a play as thrilling as any of those that has come before. By turns intense and tense, some of the fights were exhilarating, but more were simply brutal. Often, they were all a bit too much, and they rushed the audience through the plot. The climactic fight between two nimble young warriors, Tamburlaine and Gawain, took place in the most spectacular sequence. Tamburlaine is a young man who is forced to wear a helmet; Gawain, the warrior who is the son of the noble and venerable Gawain and brother to Tamburlaine’s great uncle, is a younger man who’s taken a liking to him. Gawain turns a blind eye to Tamburlaine and Gawain’s plans to capture Tamburlaine, while Gawain’s brother, Sir Thomas, is the son of the great and great-great Gawain. Gawain must kill Tamburlaine to make way for Sir Thomas’ son. When Gawain’s son is murdered, Tamburlaine is dragged back into the battle, but then tries to kill him. Gawain is wounded and falls to his knees when he sees Tamburlaine’s head. Gawain throws Tamburlaine to his death before they can say farewell. This fight is so exciting and exciting, you can barely take your eyes off the stage. It’s a play that is not only full of action, it is very funny. Gawain’s wit and physicality are complemented by the comedy and comedic timing of the actors. While the fighting is intense, it is very well done. In particular, the fight between Gawain and Tamburlaine is a real crowd-pleaser. The latter is played by James McAdams as the villain, and he is fantastic. I don’t think anyone has played Gawain better in the last three decades. McAdams is a versatile actor. He can be a young noble, a younger man, and a more mature noble. His personality changes based on how he engages with Tamburlaine. McAdams shows a lot of growth in the last three years with a range of characters that are great to watch. The one role he seems to take to the absolute limit is of Tamburlaine. He has lost his leg, but he is still able to swing a sword. McAdams is also excellent as the arch enemy, Garter, who is the ruthless, mastermind of Tamburlaine’s plans, though the two characters may have much in common. At times, McAdams’ performance is almost comical. When a man is confronted by Tamburlaine, he gets up and reveals his bare chest, which has been used to hide his body in the first place. When he comes to be, he also shows off his stomach and shoulder blades, making him look very muscular and invincible. McAdams also does a great job of showing off the great swordfighting, when he and the rest of the cast are making up their own moves on the ramparts. The fight in the last act is a particular highlight. McAdams is brilliant in his fight against his nemesis, the powerful Lord Owyhee. He fights back hard when he is attacked and, while he cannot reach Garter, he does a great","Tamburlaine the Great is a ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior Tamburlaine the Great. He is also a legend, said to be the most powerful in English literature – but he was the last great of a generation of warriors, a name which never came to be used as his works were banned in England. The play has never been revived. It was first performed in London in 1592 by Sir William Shakespeare, a play regarded as one of his greatest creations.","A giddy young lady tucked under her arms, as she held the snazzy little black mask of Tamburlaine the Great, admonished her parents, that she was about to go to see an action-packed, opulent production of Marlowe’s epic play, Tamburlaine the Great. The theatre was packed with enthusiastic school-age children on the Friday before its opening night. Theatre Charles Spencer A. Tamburlaine the Great was written by Marlowe in 1598. He is an ambitious playwright whose works are among the most popular dramas ever written. His most famous work, Tamburlaine the Great, tells the story of a powerful king who fights to protect his people from the evil powers of a foreign prince. The play is a ten-act epic about an all-conquering warrior. The epic plays a number of themes, including cruelty, power, family feuds and the power of speech. As the play opens, a child sits in her father’s lap, singing the popular tune. Her mother calls to tell her that her son wants to know about the play, and she points at a group of people. “Where are you? I live here.” She runs over to the boy and asks, “Have you come?” The boy says, “Yes, I’ve come.” He runs over to her and asks, “Have you come?” The girl laughs at her mother, and then continues with her momma. When the child says, “No. I didn’t do that.” The boy tells her that the girl is her momma. She says, “I don’t know.” Tamburlaine pauses and asks her, “Have you come?” She answers, “No,” and hurries on to her mom’s bed. The child says, “Mama! I can’t believe you’re in a play...” She says, “Yes, I know, it’s a really good play, and I thought it was great! The other girls, even the princess, laughed when the boy told her that she had a crush on Tamburlaine. “The princes and other women who had a crush on him were not allowed to get near him, even though he loved them.” But there was one woman who refused to be kissed by the princess. “It is so hard for a girl to be loved when she’s only four. And I felt sorry for her, too. I was so very sorry for her. She had to go to the hospital – that’s one reason I’m here to tell you that,” the boy said. The boy, Tamburlaine, threw himself into a lake and started to swim, but the current was too cold. Tamburlaine stopped the slithering and turned and jumped into the water. He grabbed the water and threw it up against the river. The waves dragged it to the surface, where he jumped in the water and swam away. He swam into the river several times, but there was nothing he could see except a pile of trash on the bottom. Tamburlaine swam away on his back and then climbed on a ladder and started to swim back. The water was cold, but he could not resist the temptation of it, so he ran back into the river, swam down the hill, went up the hill and over the river. That he could not swim is a miracle because the man did not speak at the beginning, which he later regretted. Tamburlaine was a good soldier – he attacked many enemies, killed a lot of people and won a lot of battles. He was brave, honest and strong. He did not fight for long, though. He started to go to sleep in his tent and then awoke a few minutes before the play began. He looked at his mother and she said, “Have you ever been scared before?” Then she said, “Yes, I have.” Tamburlaine took a few deep breaths and said, “Yes, I have. I am scared sometimes. But I am not scared for long. Because I am a brave man. I am a fighter.” He went on to say, “No, I didn’t fear for long, but I did fear for a little.” After that he collapsed and lay on the ground. “And you would tuck","Tamburlaine the Great is the greatest play ever written. Terry Hands’ production is a huge triumph and he has hacked many great chunks of the text to make it more exciting and readable. It seems the play is meant to be an epic but there are parts where it has run over two hours and in which it is just the two main characters. It is also a play about a king who has become a legend. There are many fantastic performances, some of which are just fantastic but others that are just plain brilliant. At the end of Act One, as Tamburlaine is thrown into the wilderness, he meets a young girl – who’s pregnant – and gets her pregnant, which ends up in a fight between them. Both the men in these scenes are extremely well done, the young woman having a great time, especially when Tamburlaine flies away with her. At one point, Tamburlaine fights with a sword over a large pillar. He is unable to make it up, though. There is a scene where Tamburlaine comes up against two young men who have been trying to kill him for months. One of them is the king, who has a great sword and he tells Tamburlaine to get up and fight. There is some drama over who will win – Tamburlaine’s daughter or the other men – but the drama keeps going. A great climax – the man being thrown into the wilderness, putting his sword to his chest and punching with it – sets off the final section of the play. This scene is amazing as it shows Tamburlaine fighting and winning in one go. The climax is set to music with a great symphony of wind blowing against Tamburlaine’s head. Another fantastic aspect is the lighting which is by David Eades, who has done so much with lighting to bring a real cinematic feel. This was the first time Eades had used a stage that I had never seen before. It has been said that Tamburlaine is one of the most brilliant and famous plays ever written. As a king who has taken on many demons, he has to face some of the worst of them. One particularly bad demon is Caloger, who is played by Tom Eades and his sword playing is astonishing. His hilarity at fighting demons is truly brilliant. Tamburlaine’s sword fights were gruesome so I was not expecting a lot from the jousting action. It was very exciting to watch Tamburlaine fighting. He was such a strong, determined character that I was looking forward to seeing his final fight. His final fight at the end was something else. He battled the demons in front of a large crowd and he gave great displays of strength. What really grabbed me was his final fight which was performed in such a fashion that the audience could almost hear it."
C1,"When I contacted Sony Pictures Home Entertainment for their new DVD line, I was told that A Abyss was the film slated to hit the big screen this year. It had previously been released on home video in 1986, but Sony has announced that A Abyss will also be released on DVD. James Cameron and a screenplay written by Peter Berg and David Chase, both no strangers to cold-war thrillers, directed this claustrophobic, sweaty, Cold War-set film. The team of oil riggers, navy experts and their dog, Bud (Michael Caine) are forced into a world of fear and danger that the film brilliantly evokes.","During World War II, a nuclear submarine named USS Kitty Hawk was stranded off the coast of South Korea a little less than 10 miles beneath the ocean. As the United States Navy, including a few top brass, tried to rescue it, they were thwarted by a nuclear sub that was leaking fuel and causing a massive explosion. When the submarine's crew realized it was unsustainable, they attempted to rescue it for the first time, but were shot down by German spies and their Russian counterparts. Now, some 60 years later, they are determined to bring the submarine back, no matter what that means for both American and Russian lives. Director James Cameron, who won his Oscar for Titanic, adapted the story from Jack Reacher's book, and it remains an evocative, claustrophobic Cold War thriller that's fun to rewatch. (The cast is good.) I loved the humor and the characterizations of Bud, the oil rig foreman, and his crewmates, most of whom have worked together for more than 30 years. In fact, they even have a spoof radio show, a skepticism that helps them cope with the claustrophobia and the horrors they face. They also get the chance to prove that sometimes when everything goes wrong for good, things get better. If I'm being honest, it also reminded me of movies directed by Howard Hawks. These days, however, many movies are rated R or PG. To get started, read a movie review.","ABYSS Long before Titanic director James Cameron made this sweaty claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water, Howard Hawks made this wry, funny and occasionally touching Cold War thriller. It also rekindles memories of similarly laconic heroes in movies directed by Howard Hawks.","An oil rig crew stranded many miles beneath water finds themselves forced to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded hundreds of miles off the coast of Cuba after an accident and a mysterious explosion. A film in the mold of classics such as Titanic, A Abyss is a hard-core, action-packed Cold War adventure film about oil rig foremen Bud and his fellow workers who have to rely on devious ruses and a sense of humor to guide them through the difficult and at times, deadly challenge of working in a claustrophobic and sterile environment. The banter and self-deprecating bravery of Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes. It’s a gloomy, slow-burning, hard-to-swallow tale that feels familiar yet utterly fresh – though it’s hard to say why the movie feels new or fresh given its age. But it is worth a watch for the characters alone. There are moments of pure suspense when you find yourself wondering how the crew could have gotten into this situation at all. Some elements of it are laughable: one particularly gruesome scene involves the men laughing and teasing Bud, who doesn’t look so much like an idiot as like a spoiled brat (his face gleams in brightly lit flashbacks). Still, it’s the cast that really impresses: they’ve got a terrific blend of realism and humor, in an epic and heart-stopping drama that will keep you on your toes. A gruesome and bloody scene when two submarines collide is a truly memorable sequence; the whole movie comes to life onscreen in those moments. A claustrophobic and grim comedy about oil rig workers trying to rescue a nuclear submarine in the waters off Cuba is a fascinating and satisfyingly difficult tale. The film’s central character is a hammy, fumbling captain (Donnie Wahlberg) who isn’t much of an actor; he’s more of a buffoon than a real man, but he’s well worth watching. He’s a smug smuggler who just wants to make a buck. His ego makes him one of the nastiest characters in all film history. He’s a one-liners’ kind of guy. While it’s one-dimensional and grimy in parts, the movie has moments of genuine emotion in its portrayal of the people trapped in the unending dark. It’s a great watch – and, if you’re looking for an action flick, it’s probably worth seeing.","A Abyss Long before Titanic director James Cameron made this sweaty claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water, the banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindles memories of similarly laconic heroes in movies directed by Howard Hawks, the prolific director of the 1960s and 1970s. The eerie story of a Navy submarine in an underwater cavern begins in 1943 with two oil rig workers in deep water, the foreman being the leader and chief engineer, Bud is a small man, but a tough, cynical, likable guy whose self-deprecating sense of humour reveals itself when he and his men encounter a mysterious submarine buried in the depths of the ocean. James’s review of A Abyss appears in The Guardian, and on the BBC website. Its soundtrack is by the British rock band The Beatles, and the soundtrack is excellent. I love the song in the film, ‘Season of Joy’, which is great. I am sure a lot of learners could sing along. This story also appears in the April 2017 issue of TES English News.","A young boy goes to his grandparents for a summer vacation.

C1,"At this time, it is a difficult time in newspapers’ world. There is a fear that an over-enthusiastic media industry, with its focus on short-term profits and a lust for sensationalism and clickbait headlines, will whittle down journalism’s global reach and make print a thing of the past, and that the digital-only paper era will end up being a golden age. As is often the case, a number of newspapers have already been able to weather the worst of this turbulence – and some are already prospering. It is a fascinating read – which I first read when it was published in the Financial Times – but it is a warning to newspapers – and to all those involved in the process – about how much longer print may have to exist. And that it is in fact far from certain. The digital-only newspapers of the future, then, will not have the reach and traction that print newspapers did. And they will have to change in ways that paper newspapers did not: they will have to reinvent themselves. The only way forward is not only online. But it will be a change that is far less dramatic and uncertain than the one from print to online. In a newspaper there is a need for a constant flow of content. In print newspapers, that flow, which depends on readers visiting the physical paper and engaging with the stories therein, is often thin. It is not a terribly exciting prospect. If the online audience of a newspaper were to be able to match the readership of a traditional paper then, quite simply, the number of readers who would have to make the journey to physically visit the paper would be minimal and could well be small. Instead, the online audience may be able to reach readers in many more places, not just in the UK but across the world. To put it another way, the online newspaper has to provide a daily, recurring source of news that readers will come back to and then read over and over again – and again. Then again, print journalism is not a very interesting business; print journalism just happens to have been more profitable for quite a few years. It can do two things: it can reach readers through a combination of ads on the page and adverts in the newspaper. For example, you might be able to sell ad space in a newspaper by offering an exclusive deal to a reader or a service like a subscription. There is a different way of getting that in a newspaper. It might be something called “digital delivery”. You will have to pay for that – but you will still be able to read that on your tablet or smartphone. Another alternative is to sell advertising space in the newspaper for people who are not even subscribed to that particular newspaper. The advertising may not be directly tied to a subscriber or even a reader – it will be sold when the reader decides to go online and there will be a minimum subscription required, though that may be very small compared to a standard newspaper. And that’s where the problem lies. This is a huge challenge for newspaper executives because they have had to adapt. Newspaper executives need to keep themselves ahead of the technology curve because if they don’t, they are in big trouble. And that’s where the future of print lies. The answer for many papers now is that they will have to rethink their strategy and rethink their business. Some will need to be able to look at their business from an entirely different angle – and it’s not simply about print – it is about mobile, e-reader and other print innovations. This could be the biggest shift newspapers have seen since the start of the 20th century. It will be the biggest risk for the newspaper industry – and in many cases it will be the only one that will take place, meaning that it will be the hardest to change. It is the world’s largest newspaper market, the second largest publisher by sales after the US and the second largest in the world. And that means that there are going to be a lot of challenges. And it will have to be a very good transition.","As Britain’s newspapers face the reality of an online future, some are still arguing that print is on its way out. But the final battle has already been fought – and won. Quite how we view print in the future, says Peter Preston, a journalist and journalist-in-residence at the Telegraph. One view is that newspapers should be able to survive in the digital age as long as they understand that they will need to adjust to the new realities of the digital environment as fast as possible. Others, however, argue that print will have to adapt very quickly. It’s hard to see how print will be able to remain relevant to its readers as it disappears from news stands. “We have a strong case to make that print is important to people. But it isn’t going to go anywhere because it doesn’t look good when you’re in your car,” says Preston. “People are getting used to seeing their news online. But the internet has the ability to make that change even easier. In fact, even if newspapers don’t adapt quickly, they may fail to keep pace.","The end of print may take some time. The Guardian is the paper of record for the nation and for many of its readers. It is also the newspaper which is most likely to disappear from many people’s homes – the paper which holds all the power. Its staff will be replaced by a different set of digital assistants and it may be a few years before there are no printed copies to read in any part of the country. The Independent on Sunday, which is owned by News International, is an imprint of the British Newspaper Association and the only newspaper which is still in print. It was founded in 1793 and is the oldest independent newspaper in the country. It is also the only one in Britain with a paid circulation. Its online circulation and adverts are now outweighed by print. Its current print run is 675,000, down from 865,000 in 2007. At the same time, its ad revenue is growing, but not by a lot. It is proving to be a difficult time for the newspaper industry. Most of the biggest names in news and media have changed to online news or ad-free sites. The Guardian has moved from print to iPad and tablet formats. This will give the Guardian more reach with people at home and in the car, helping it to maintain its position as the leading English newspaper for the digital age. It is also more affordable – it is a paper that does not charge for advertising – while attracting a younger readership. At the same time, the Guardian does not rely on advertising to keep its business going. It uses the revenue from digital advertising to pay for its staff and marketing. Newspapers must face two choices. One is to continue publishing in print, or if they do so it will have to be as a standalone, digital brand. This would be a major shift and will almost certainly be painful for those employed in the printing industry. The other is for the newspaper itself to move from print to its online counterpart. This will mean that both print and online publications will be the last to print newspapers in many of the same towns in which they were founded. These towns are increasingly attracting young people from around the world, and the fewer places where they are allowed to produce newspapers have left them with more people to rely on to survive. So what will newspapers do? Many will decide to do nothing at all. Some will sell newspapers online. Others will simply go dark. In such a case they may need to find a new audience or create a new brand. The most interesting thing that they will have to do is to make their newspapers better than they were in the old days. For many, print is an important part of their lives, and the newspaper will not disappear without a fight. They will simply find a new way to communicate and sell their content. But they will not be able to do that in their current way. They will be forced to seek new ways of communicating and selling their content.","In the end, it’ll be all over – but not in print. The end of print may take some time. Peter Preston, the editor of the UK’s national newspaper, The Daily Mail, said: “Nowhere is the end of print imminent. Print remains an important element in the newsroom. But to give up on print is to betray the trust of the public, who will probably never read news online. “We are now in a period of massive transformation, with print vanishing. Newspapers are being crushed by the digital revolution.","Two years ago, the final issue of the Sunday Times printed a list of 71 books to be written by women. The following year, women took the list to the shops. But now the list is dwindling even further: just 39 are currently available in print. The Times is no exception. In the UK, it had 67 books to write and in the US, it had just 28. This year, it has lost nearly 30 books in the UK. Many are being bought with loans, with more than half going online. In some places, like London, there are fewer than 10 copies. In some small towns, there are no more than eight. When the first digital newspaper launched in 2010, just seven UK newspapers were in print. Today, there are fewer than 25 UK newspapers. In the US, about 50 remain. The number of print-only newspapers has fallen from 67 in 1990 to 41 in 2010. The end of print may take a long time, but it will happen. The future of the Sunday Times is uncertain. Only three of the current 67 newspapers are in digital form. The Telegraph, the country’s largest newspaper, has moved almost entirely online. And at the London Evening Standard, the online version of the paper was outselling newspapers in the UK for the first time last year, with the paper accounting for 17% of daily circulation, according to figures published last month. The Sunday Times’s digital rival, the Guardian, has doubled its audience this year to 160,000. But the Guardian’s digital readership - an average of 21,000 a month - is still just 21% of that of print. The Telegraph’s online readership is the fourth highest in the world, but online readership is still declining. For that to happen, the number of print newspapers must disappear. The biggest single challenge for the newspaper industry is the ageing population. In the UK, the average age of the population is almost four. With just under 60 per cent reading newspapers in print, that has an impact. The ageing population poses a challenge for newspapers. With some newspapers closing down, readers are switching from print to digital in droves, even if they still prefer paper. As many as a quarter of UK newspaper households are estimated to be over 55, and more than a third of these over the age of 65. This is a significant proportion of the population. It also raises the potential for news to become even less accessible. Print newspaper readers who use smartphones or tablet devices to read newspapers will find that they are increasingly unable to use them, or unable to use all of their content on these devices. Some papers are simply no longer financially viable. In the North of England, for example, the local Sunday Times has shut down following the move to iPads, while its circulation dropped by more than half last year. The Telegraph also announced that it would stop publishing its news online. There are several factors in play, not least of which is a growing trend among readers to prefer to read newspapers online. People are not reading newspapers online simply because they don’t think they can read it. While people are unlikely to switch from print to digital, they still do use newspapers to carry news. The Telegraph’s print run of 343 million was its best ever – that is to say that it had about as many people reading it in print as it did in digital. The impact of a shift to online is difficult to gauge, with much of the content being available in print, while much of its digital content has not changed. People are still glued to newspapers, although they are spending less and less time reading them. The Telegraph has seen a dramatic decrease in audience, but its advertising revenue is up by a quarter since 2009. According to the latest Ipsos MORI figures, newspaper readership is expected to increase by 11% this year. And the number of people who use their mobile phones to read newspapers is also increasing. It is estimated that 21% of newspaper readers use their smartphones to read their newspapers. Online circulation is not yet fully covered by the press. It is not yet clear what will happen to newspapers’ online income. In the UK, a small number of newspapers have managed to bring in their own online income. The Telegraph still has some traditional print readers, but it no longer has an annual circulation in excess of 500,000. The Times’ audience is made up of readers aged 18-24. A study by FT & Partners, published last year, found that 43% of UK internet users read their newspapers on a mobile or tablet device. This is a high proportion of people aged 18-24, at least in the north of England. The Telegraph commissioned an independent research company to find out if this increased demand would lead to a rise in digital subscription","AN INCONVIENNE ANALYSER OF THE PERCEPTION OF NEWSPAPER MARKETS Peter Preston The newspaper industry has been mired in controversy for decades over its perceived reluctance to adapt to change and embrace the digital age. The debate is raging in some quarters over how newspapers can survive as a separate entity in a multi-media world when there are few viable alternatives. “Our industry has a tough time maintaining an equilibrium when a newspaper in print is out of print, compared to an internet-only service,” according to the Guardian. The deteriorating economics of print-only services are also proving difficult to navigate. “The market, if we understand the dynamics, is essentially a free-market system, so newspaper owners can charge a subscription, and this can be very profitable,” said a BBC commentator cited by the Daily Telegraph. However, while newspaper circulation is still growing, they are struggling to find the revenue to cover their staff, overheads and legal costs. Many of today’s news and sports editors work with publishers in online platforms and charge for content, rather than print. That means newspaper publications often don’t have the revenue to cover such costs. Consequently, some print newspapers are resorting to a strategy that would involve selling advertising on their websites, a strategy they see as a more cost-effective alternative to the increasingly expensive media buying that goes along with them. Publishers have always been reluctant to cut their content and pay for advertising, so the decision to cut news was a difficult one to make. But the decision was made in the midst of a battle over the right to be a journalist. The decision was one of the first to be questioned by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). It involved what a newspaper should do in the digital age. In its brief, newspapers are obliged to provide information to the public but in the digital world there are no restrictions on what a publisher must do with that information. As a result, there is little room to negotiate the details of content. The ICO was set up by the Conservatives in 2005 with the aim of preserving the ability of print publishers to operate independently, but the ICO has since been transformed into a new organisation called the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO is tasked with ensuring that government statutory duties are fulfilled by ensuring that privacy issues are upheld and that all published information is not used for propaganda purposes. In the ICO, the ICO monitors and responds to complaints about the publication of material which is potentially damaging to the rights of people in any country. At least 87 ICO cases have been registered in the ICO in the six years since it began. The number of cases is increasing – and the ICO is currently investigating the handling of complaints related to newspaper content. With the public’s trust in journalists and readers declining and with digital platforms gaining traction it may be a while before newspapers return to their former glories. Then newspaper businesses will have no choice but to accept that their existence has become a thing of the past, a thing that is now too late to change. As it stands, it isn’t just about what newspapers do, but also what they do not do. News titles need to embrace the digital age for many reasons – not least to attract the young people who want to remain informed. “The world has changed – it’s a very exciting time – but it also has many challenges ahead, as the media’s dependence on the traditional mass market continues to decline. “However, the digital world is not going to vanish overnight, because it has a lot of young people to reach and it has a lot of big players, so the new business landscape is hugely exciting for everyone,” said Matt Beech, the editor of The Spectator and Guardian. “The industry is in a period of change, with many of the people with the most significant professional roles having moved online. As a result, the traditional media companies are finding it difficult to understand the dynamics of the digital world, or how to best adapt. Many are also arguing that the shift should be accelerated so as to attract people to a newspaper rather than reducing their numbers or moving readers to online services. That would mean keeping the news online and allowing print newspapers to continue being a vital tool in a new age of newspaper journalism. The key question is how fast the new business will emerge, and whether or not it will be able to sustain itself in an environment that will increasingly be hostile to journalism",The end of print may take some time.

But for most of my day I am waiting around tables, in a waiting room, to see people who have been in a coma for over a month. It's always a stressful experience when you've been in a coma because you are used to being in a hospital. Most of my clients go into hospital with a list of medical problems that have been affecting their lives for several years. Most people are in a state of shock because they haven't expected it.

My shift lasts an hour but I usually end up spending four hours there."" She also has a very demanding job, which she says can change dramatically from day to day. ""I can start my shift at 7am and can only take four patients a day,"" she said. ""I usually have an hour break after working for 10 hours.

Maybe there is something you don't know about your own career that you really do not know about. I am a brain surgeon, a neurologist. That's what I do. I work in the brain at a hospital, and I have the opportunity to do the most complex brain surgery in the world. And that's the main thing I like about it. I have to be really sharp, to be able to operate on such a complex structure as a human brain. You have to be very smart to be able to perform such a complex task. I like working with people who need a lot of help. A lot of the time I have to make the right decisions, and be able to treat people who have been in accidents or have been abused. I also have to be very compassionate, to be able to put the patient first. I also have to be very dedicated and persevering. I go into this job thinking I have to go in and save a life and I do, but the real reality is that I have to make a difference for people. I need to be a good person, so that is very important. In the field of neurosurgery, you have to be very skilled with your hands. I had to learn how to use a microscope to look into a person's brain, and I still have to be very good with my hands, which is a big skill in this field. There are so many things that I have to keep in mind. I have to stay calm when things go wrong. And also, I have to be very clever so that I do not make the wrong decision, and have to help the patient. Everybody, in this field, must be really good, so that the patients get the best care and the best surgery. There is lots of pressure, and sometimes you need to do surgery fast because sometimes you need to save the lives of people that you really don't know, because you've never seen them before. Also, I need to be very organised so that we can get everything done and on time. And finally, I need to be super reliable, so that I can go out and get things done, and I have to be very good at it because I'm often the one who needs to do the surgery. I get up at 6.00am, go to the gym at 7.00am, get to work by 8.30am and start operating at 8.30am. Then, I stay here all day, and then I have a dinner break at 8pm, then I work until 4am. And my day ends around 8pm when I usually get home. I like working like this. I love to be able to look after my patients, and save their lives. My colleagues are very nice and professional, and my boss is always there for me. I enjoy the challenge of a brain operation, and the satisfaction of helping a patient get better.

Luckily I'm a very good surgeon so I can always find someone to take care of my patients."" I'm a neurosurgeon, and I treat brain and spinal cord injuries. For example, I have to deal with brain damage caused by accidents. In some cases, I have to remove tissue from the brain. I'm also in charge of the patients, so I must keep my patients safe. I have to be very careful, so I have to have an excellent eye for things, so I have to look for things that are suspicious and dangerous. I have to be an excellent surgeon so I can save other people's lives. And I need to be quick, so I can remove the brain as soon as possible. I've been in the field for more than six years and I love it. But every day is different because I get to travel so much, and I have to talk to different people who I don't know very well.

C1,The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him.,"Charles Hurst works in the cabinet-maker's workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London. He has the reputation of making perfectly crafted furniture but he has never had a chance to show it off. Until now. A man in a hurry is not really his style. His skill lies in the quality of the wood used, which is the primary material. 'I'll never do a cheap job that doesn't last.' he says. Joanna Watt meets him Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. And why? His first job after leaving college was a squat, wooden shop in London. There he would sit on his front lawn, a task so hard he never actually managed to get paid. So he did some odd jobs for odd jobs money, including scrounging up old bits of furniture from a second-hand shop to make a hut in his garden. He didn't have a shop but a friend did, and the two spent hours preparing cabinets and stools that could sit outside for weeks, perhaps even years. 'There's no point in a hut in here, you know. You can't leave any money on it, and if you do leave money, the hut is the only place in the country you can sell it.' When he finished work, he emptied the hut into a large pile that he stored under the workshop. It still had plenty of tools and some old bits. He couldn't afford a whole workshop, so he bought out another one to be able to move all his wood around more freely. He sold his first job to a man who bought a boat from his friend and renamed it the 'Britannia hut'. After that, he started selling his work to clients, including a lone woman who asked for a stool, but her family had a problem. The hut itself was falling apart as she moved, and he had become frustrated that no one seemed to understand him. Charles sold most of his work to the girl, and his shop was a flop, so it was a flop for a few years. He had lost his job, his money, and his reputation. He had gotten so depressed that he had become angry. One night, he had gone to the toilet in a church. 'Are you still here?' he asks, his face contorted. He'd bought all of his furniture from some of his friends. The man had also bought the hut, and had told his friends it was a good place to live. Charles told them he wanted to go and do something different. They helped him start a wood-working business. Charles then started to make his own furniture. He wanted to make a business selling his work. That night, he put on one of his usual evening shows, which he never stopped doing. He invited a few friends over, and at about 2 a.m. he played a short round of poker with them before heading out for his workshop. He took Joanna Watt there and talked to her for an hour about the cabinet-making business. When he heard she was going to visit from London, he thought he would drop a line enquiring if he could come and see his work. He took a photo of the hut and had his friend call her the next morning. The two women had become friends, and he kept in touch over the years. They had a good relationship. When he got laid off from his job in 2009, he did not have to worry about working, because he was still making furniture. I sat in a chair in the back, watching him carefully work the mortise a hole in one piece of wood. A little while later he started carving a piece of wood on a small saw, so that his friend could keep an eye on it.","CHARLES HURST makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture. In the workshop, he spends an entire afternoon focusing on just two pieces of work – a piece for his own office and a cabinet for his dining room, both constructed from reclaimed wood, and each piece made from the same block of wood that he first saw it, as he saw it, at the earliest time. ""Well fire away then!"" is his standard greeting and the way the pieces appear together is like a clock ticking to the right minute. I imagine the work takes three days in the workshop and that it's sometimes like two days on the bench, but I ask him to take my time: ""It's so much quicker to start when you're not distracted by all the tools. ""But then, I imagine, you get bored before long. ""What's it like to work with someone who's always done the exact same thing? ""He's a perfectionist, but he still has the kind of hands that the old masters had, too."" Charles's first piece of furniture was a simple wooden chest called The Lady In Waiting. It was the size of a small suitcase and was designed for his wife, Caroline. It was made of reclaimed wood and had a round top so it could be stood on. It was the perfect bedside table to display a painting of the Queen. The next piece he made was a wardrobe called The Armoire. He knew his furniture was in high demand and so he went online and advertised for the jobs. The next thing I knew, Charles' work was so impressive that he offered to come and design the whole wardrobe for me.","Joanna Watt is interested in the lives of the creative people around her. She's seen and heard their ideas, felt their dreams, listened to their stories. But when she visited Charles Hurst at his workshop, in East London, she felt he was at the opposite end of the scale. She was interested in his work, in his quiet, gentle manner. She wanted to know how he made his money. The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture.

He has carefully carved intricate sculpted figurative details into the stonework. This includes inlays and carvings. Charles likes to make a variety of pieces of furniture, but his most famous work is the Victorian cabinet that he has crafted for Sir Winston Churchill. As I listen, I feel the calm and quiet of his work flow through me. He speaks of his great-grandfather, a cabinet-maker and cabinetmaker's son. He also talks about how he learned to make wooden boxes - which he describes as 'the most important thing in the world'. Charles also tells me about his family. In his childhood, he was interested in collecting art, music, and books. He told me that his parents were also into antiques and that he had often seen them in antique shops. He told me he had a grandfather who made an incredible number of pieces of furniture. He told me about his great uncle, Charles Hurst, a cabinet-maker who was the heir to a great manor. He told me about his father, a brewer and a cabinet-maker of many talents. In his youth, he would be a farmer in some of the most remote parts of his native Australia. As I listen to him, I feel the calm and quiet flow through him.","Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who lives in a railway arch in East London, a quiet village that has seen much to do in the last century. However, he is not the type of entrepreneur to spend all of his time and energy in the business. Charles Hurst has a very simple philosophy, which is rooted in his belief that the perfect object cannot be made in a day. He has devoted his time and energy to making each piece of furniture a work of art. Taking hours to make an oak armchair is more than the average worker can manage. He has a sense of craftsmanship that is hard to match – as he also appreciates that he needs to be able to turn away at any time without breaking a sweat. Charles makes his living delivering and installing furniture, and he likes to go the extra mile. In addition to the furniture he has built, he also uses his time to teach others how to make furniture. He shows me the process he uses to build a bespoke cabinet for his father. There are many aspects of making a cabinet. Charles explains that each piece must be able to endure rough handling. When he began he used old wooden crates as tools. Over time, the boxes were replaced with old crates made from cardboard. Today, it’s possible to build a cabinet out of a cardboard box, as there isn’t much space available in the workshop. In the early days of cabinet making, these boxes are quite practical. They can fit in a car boot, and they can easily be folded away after use. Charles tries to minimize the amount of tools he uses. This isn’t surprising: he makes cabinetry in his home workshop, where he spends his days observing and observing himself. One day he decided to make a full-size cabinet in the shape of a cat, to be used for his grandfather, whose cat he has never met. He sewed a fabric covering for the box, and attached two screws and a belt. Charles and his dad, who live in a cottage not far from the workshop, are looking at the cabinet. It isn’t perfect, but when he looks inside, he sees all the work that had gone into it. A lot of what he makes goes back to the process of making a chair, with the remark that a man should never take an ordinary thing and turn it into a masterpiece. He is fascinated by the art of furniture-making. One day when he was working, he walked into a local shop and saw a pile of furniture for sale. He bought it as soon as he saw it, then returned to his workshop to make another. He took the sofa from the first one he had made in the early days, and used a piece of wood that he had salvaged from the garden, the drawers were lined with wood scraps he had scraped from the workbench, and a drawer. He made the chairs with the same wood and same wood from the boxes, and gave them a coat of paint. Once he had it dry-dried, he took them to the local hardware store, where he tidied up all the corners and sanded them – just how he did it when he was just twelve years old. He did this until he started to think the pieces should be hung in a row. This he used to do, and then just about everyone around him did it too. Even today, he gives up the furniture in a heap at the back of his garage – after a few days, he re-assembles it into an even more perfectly crafted piece of furniture. Although he works from a small workshop, he lives in the village – a community he admires enormously – and is proud of his work. After a few more visits with his wife and children, Charles thinks he needs a new hobby, so he’s decided to learn how to build some simple furniture, using a few of his favourite techniques. He’s currently working on a series of small tables in his home workshop, and hopes to make a coffee table. With his new tools, he’ll go out of his way to make each piece work for him.","Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture, based on his family's workshop in East London. He focuses on high quality and classic design. His son is a reformed bully, but it is not all about his son. Charles is also a passionate supporter of the arts in Britain, and regularly lectures people about furniture-making, in a way that is surprisingly accessible for a young man. Charles was a cabinet-maker when he was in his early twenties, working for his father in North London. When his father died, he started his own business and continued making furniture, which he sold to high-end auction houses. He has been making furniture ever since. When Charles was in his early twenties, his father took on two new jobs, at the London Stock Exchange and a private business in London. Then, in his late thirties, he took over his fathers business, and worked from home and travelled around the country and overseas on commissions. In the 1970s, Charles went on to open a showroom, which now has a staff of nine, where he continues to make furniture. One day in 1979, a customer came into Charles's shop looking for a wardrobe. He asked Charles to make him one and he did, putting a handwritten quote on the back. He then waited and waited, until an old friend of his called him back. The client wanted to get a second opinion and asked Charles to make a mirror for him. Ultimately, it took him a year to make the mirror, and he still has a little problem – he needs it to be a certain size. The mirror must be a certain size. The customer said: 'What do you think?' and Charles listened.","Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture. I find it hard to believe the man who once worked with the British Royal Family to make a living on his skills. I've been looking at the world around me with fresh eyes lately and see what's missing, from architecture, the environment, the way people work. When I meet Charles Hurst I see just the opposite. The world around me is made up of very cheap stuff. I see people, who are mainly young and well-fed, unable to make a living because there's nothing to sell. There are a few people in the world who can't get by on very little, because everything else is so expensive. It would be impossible for them to pay for their own homes - they have to take loans and get loans from friends. But that's how things work with Charles Hurst. He sees the world as a source of creative energy, not a source of cheap energy. The world is a source of natural resources, not of cheap energy. Charles sees this, too, but is looking for ways to share them. When the BBC commissioned him to produce a documentary, he agreed, saying that the film would include three pieces he had made, including this chair. I also saw some of the pieces he was working on at the time; a chair he designed a while back; and a desk he designed when he started making furniture. I was fascinated by the 'craftsman' spirit of the piece, and his work is so detailed that it is hard to imagine the material in which it is made. The process of creating a piece of furniture can be thought of as a series of steps. The idea is to design, build and then assemble a chair that is right for the room it was made in. So the first step is to choose a frame for it. Each piece is then built using a variety of materials, and is then given a sanding and a painting to give it a rich finish. Some of Charles's pieces are also made entirely by hand. For example, the carved front of a chair is made by sanding the finished piece to remove the wood to reveal a small, bare wood panel. Using a lathe, the wood is then cut away from the edge to reveal the surface. Other steps include laying out the shape of the leg to create the shape of the chair, attaching the piece together using glue and wood glue. If required, wax is also used to protect the woodwork. For example, the top of a chair is sanded and glued to give it a beautiful effect. This process is repeated for every piece and then, depending on the finish, it is cut up and reshaped as required. In between pieces, the chair is treated for scratches and damage. After completing every part of the job, Charles uses a dremel to give it a smooth finish. The final stages are cleaning and polishing."
C1,"My friend Charles Clover is one of those solar explorers who wants to leave the world a better place and the first place he went was to Britain’s most environmentally-friendly home, located in Southwell, a village in Nottinghamshire, England, on the site of the ancient cathedral, which is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral. He walked up the hill from his house to visit the local museum, where he found a small house – a converted farmhouse – which could save electricity and water, as well as watering the gardens at the back. Close up is a large green house with a pond of water and a windmill. Inside is an old house with two more windmills and a wood-burning stove. The living room had a wood burning stove for the winter. On the side was a solar photovoltaic panelled roof. On the ground floor was a large pond where he replanted the plants. The wood-burning stove was also in use for heating in the summer. A cistern fed a large central fountain that was a surprise after all the rain this summer. There is also a water cistern where a cistern used to be and a pump system which pumps water up and over the roof using a small turbine. There is an unheated greenhouse with a pond and a water pump, plus a rainwater tank and a pump for a water storage tank. One of his other unused rooms was the roof space he once had. On a sunny day, you could stand on a terrace and look down over the parkland, the fields and the river. Outside is the cottage where the couple first met. It is a very green house; the plants and animals are all well established, and the house is free of clutter. The couple are very much in touch and share lots of the same interests. He has two cats, a dog and chickens, and he and his partner have a small garden full of herbs and vegetables, plus bird feeders. Apparently the couple also share a house with their children; one has a child who is ill-informed and one is a toddler who needs to go to day care. The solar panels are a gift from the owner’s parents as a thank you for the heat, light and insulation it affords the building. The house is very cosy, the beds are comfortable, and the kitchen is well equipped. The secluded terraces provide an outdoor space for outdoor entertaining, barbecues and a children’s play area. The interior of the house is a beautiful, simple and cosy room where there is a good quality bathroom, a well-stocked bookcase and a couple of other shelves with lots of books, DVDs and other useful odds and ends. The dining table and chairs face a large, very colourful, green window with a plant on one side. The kitchen is well equipped and the house has a wonderful sense of space. The property was recently listed on the Heritage Register, with a special listing of ‘Energy Star’ houses. The listing says: “One of the world’s most environmentally-friendly homes” with the title of “The Home of the Green Man”.","John Sullivan, a longtime environmentalist, has just rescued an ancient cathedral for the sake of the city’s future residents. At first he thought he might have to sell the property. But Sullivan, a father of four and an engineer, told him that this was impossible.","This month Charles Clover spends a week in the beautiful Georgian town of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, where the greenest man on earth lives. From the ruins of Southwell Minster, the oldest part of the city which houses Britain’s oldest cathedral, I’m transported back to the fourteenth century and the world famous Green Man Festival. I then venture inside to visit David Squire’s most energy efficient and green home – his stunning five-bedroom home which has been recognised by Which? as the UK’s most environmentally-friendly home, as well as crowned as the UK’s most energy efficient home of 2017 by Ecobuild. “I didn’t realise it’s the best house in the UK until I saw it,” says David Squire. He says that although the house is large, he has a lot of space to play with. He has solar panels on his roof, a wood-burning stove in the lounge, an air-to-water heat pump and a rainwater harvesting system. He has also replaced most of the water running from the taps with rainwater from the gardens which he runs as a natural system for watering the lawn. The entire property is insulated, heat-generating and fully sealed to prevent heat loss. It is also topped off with a large rainwater tank and, although he has only one toilet, he doesn’t even flush the toilet as it’s always full. The first task was to install a ventilation system to regulate the temperature in the house, and this was done by the installation of a fan. The second task was to run a heat-assisted shower to help prevent the water getting trapped in the baths. “I got a bit stuck when it came to the temperature and the hot water got out and I started sweating,” explains David. He took one of the old radiators which would otherwise be tossed in the bin and fitted a heat pump to raise the temperature. “I’m not sure I even need to add any more heaters to the house,” adds David, who now has an air-to-water heat-pump system which allows hot water to be used straight away. This is a very impressive feat for David, who grew up in the countryside but now lives in Nottingham, and has just retired from his job as a fire-economist. The most important thing he has learned is to conserve energy and he saves a lot of money by having his bathroom heated with a heat pump. David also composts all his food waste. He saves electricity by turning the TV into a heater, which he uses to turn on the radio and then gets rid of the empty rubbish cans. For David it also helps to be so well equipped and he has a huge amount of space to play with, not to mention the two ponds in his garden, and the greenhouse with a ‘cooling tower’ which allows him to grow a lawn at the front and a vegetable patch in the backyard for winter crops.","A few miles away Southwell is full of surprises. The first is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral Southwell Minster celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. Charles Clover, author of the Solar Survivor book, visits the home of a man he describes as “America’s most environmentally-friendly man”. The architect-builder Tony Wilkins has built a house which he describes as “quite simply the best home I have ever seen.” That is not the only surprise as he ventures inside the house – its sandstone exterior is as pristine as a Swiss chalet – and sees the owner, architect Tony Wilkins, building an extremely energy-efficient house which is currently Britain’s most environmentally-friendly home. Tony’s father, a former naval officer, had previously been a brewer, so he says that he has been in the business of making beer for his whole adult life. Tony claims that in all the years he owned the brewery, no bottle was ever sold for the money spent on it. Tony’s wife, Sue, has also been in the business, and they share their cottage and gardens with their two sons and their dog. They run a small business producing energy-efficient bottled water and heating the house. Tony’s family have lived in the same cottages for a number of years, and all of them are genuinely passionate about renewable energy. Tony has been using solar panels on his property for about 15 years, and is particularly proud of the fact that they have the biggest solar panels in the country. On the second floor, the house boasts the largest solar array in the country, and it also has some of the best insulation and the highest heat insulation standards in the UK.","If you ever find yourself in a small village in Nottinghamshire, it is worth picking it up and visiting Southwell Minster, Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral – famed for its pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house.","Charles Clover, Solar Survivor, has never visited a country house which is so green. But at this Victorian house near Southwell in Nottinghamshire, he is soon awestruck. The house is so green that no energy is wasted. It even boasts solar panels for its hot water. Designed by architect William Morris, the house is an example of a ‘mega house’ in which four walls are made of one block of concrete and the roof is made of wood and bamboo, with the help of a wind turbine. During summer, when the sun goes down the house is kept warm by a system of bio-degradable solar panels and heats the water.","Charles Clover, an English journalist who lives and works in Southwell, has visited two unusually-built houses in Nottinghamshire which, in different ways, may well be Britain’s most environmentally-friendly homes. The first is a house which, according to the British Renewable Energy Agency, is a zero carbon house. The second is the former home of Richard O’Donoghue. The Englishman said that during the 1970s he was forced to sell his five-bedroomed house in the village of Bridgnorth to a construction company so that his wife could move in. When the house was sold, Richard O’Donoghue said he could no longer afford to pay the mortgage but still kept the house. He used to sell the house to a local resident and, at the time of his death, decided that he could do something about it. With his wife’s help, Richard created a green house which, by the time he died, required no external heating or water. Richard O’Donoghue bought his house for £150,000 and had the cheapest energy bills of all the houses he viewed in his journey of ecstasy. He was surprised that there was so much energy on offer in his house, a two-bedroom property on the edge of a wooded ridge. But, as Richard O’Donoghue says, there is so much more than meets the eye. At the back of the house, in a sunlit lawn, stands a solar system aimed at providing enough electricity to heat the home. And it’s not just the heating system. Richard also has a rainwater collection system for a water-saving soaking tub – he even has a rain-water tank which he collects directly from his garden. Richard O’Donoghue, a native Englishman, is a journalist with the local newspaper Southwellshire Today and writes from the house. He told Charles Clover that it was important for him to keep the house warm. He used to put his wood burning stove on when it was too cold to use a conventional fireplace. He said that he would give it to a homeless person for free. It works well but sometimes, after using it for a long time, the wood burns down. However, he told Charles Clover, he didn’t think he would be able to save enough money to install another heat source."

C1,"Clay Carter was a big shot and not much of a celebrity in Washington, DC. Rodney Carter was an attorney by day and an avid gambler by night. The only problem was, he was too successful and rich to be able to go home to his wife and daughters, his job, and his family. Rodney had no place to go after his sudden death, and in his heart of hearts, he was never going to return home. So, he was in bed with his best friend Laura. Laura knew that Clay couldn't be with his son. She also knew he would return to court at any time, so he decided to take his chances. After all, he was an attorney with a criminal record, and not a member of the criminal justice system. Clay knew he had the advantage of not being in a position of power, so she arranged to have Clay be assigned to the judge, who was now a retired judge with limited power. Clay told him that Rodney had been stealing money from the business of the Countess. She also arranged for him to take over a certain large project that the Countess had wanted to complete. When the project was finished, Clay would be the architect of the deal. That's how he knew that Laura was the one who would be the boss and he did not want anyone working for him. The two of them agreed on everything, and Clay got the job. They set up shop next door to their home. Laura and Clay would sell off their inherited property, then sell off the properties that Clay had left. Rodney Carter was a businessman by trade. Before he died, he had many business interests. He owned the Florida and Georgia cattle business, worked at a casino, a telecommunications company and built a private yacht. When Laura was killed, Clay Carter went to court and became the first in US history to build a private yacht. Laura was able to take over the construction for the yacht, and despite having an unearned income, she had a well paid job and her children were well taken care of. After the trial, Clay was awarded the $17 million check from the estate. He paid off the debts, sold the business, and moved to his new home in Florida. While he was getting his life together and settling down to a new life, Clay's new boat broke down. He sold the boat before he had enough money to fix it. After the accident, Clay became very rich and made $40,000 per week off of the boat. Rodney Carter pleaded guilty to stealing from the estate and was sentenced to two years in prison. Clay left the country and began to live a more normal life away from the law. He got his job as an attorney. After a few years in Florida, Clay and Rodney decided to move to New York. They bought a dog (borrowed from Laura) and took a cruise to Europe. After they returned to the states, Rodney was able to go to California to start an independent life. Clay was able to go to San Francisco and meet with his daughter in law in the same day. Once in California, Rodney and Laura moved into a beautiful home that Clay had built before his arrest. They made sure Rodney’s new business would be successful by selling the business. Rodney bought a house on the beach in Manhattan. Clay also bought the largest single family home in the U.S. The family got a mortgage and decided it was time to have their baby. Clay was able to buy a mansion for Rodney, his daughter, and their son. After months of negotiations, Clay and Laura were able to buy their dream house in the Hamptons. Laura was able to buy a condo in Beverly Hills and she was able to build a new house for his family. As a result, she was able to have a safe and beautiful home that was out of reach for the average person. The family was able to finally celebrate Rodney and Laura's new life together and even have a few days to get married.","Rodney Carter had been to the Bahamas on numerous occasions but not during the season. Last summer, he was in a bad car accident and the other driver was killed. The accident cost Rodney his job. Clay Carter wanted the credit to pay for the accident but he was unable to get it because he is accused of theft. He is in prison but he must pay Rodney back because he has to continue working for them. Clay apologises to Rodney, and thanks Rodney. He also tells Rodney that he hasn’t told the truth about Rodney’s theft. Clay Carter was taken to the hospital where he underwent emergency surgery and rode to the hospital by ambulance. At the hospital Clay was taken to an ICU. Then the surgeon took him to the hospital. He was pronounced dead. Clay Carter tried to pretend that it was Rodney who drove him to the hospital and then he called his accountant to get some paperwork from the hospital. Clay knew that he hadn’t told Rodney about the accident or the car wreck. This would embarrass him. He lied to his accountant and told Rodney that he had seen it at the hospital and then he drove Rodney to the hospital and then drove him to the hospital. Clay Carter did not want his accountant to catch him cheating. He decided to tell his accountant about his new boat and what he did about his truck accident. After a few days of hiding in the basement of the family’s home, Clay Carter had to come out and tell Rodney what had happened. He said he drove Rodney to the hospital and he told Rodney about his new boat. Then he told Rodney he would go home. Rodney went to see his father but he was very upset and said he wanted to apologize to his mother but he was unable to talk. He was afraid that his father would never forgive him. Clay Carter wanted to get away from everything. He went to a local homeless shelter where he met Rodney and told him to go back to his home. After about an hour of talking and not eating, Rodney came back to his home and said that he had been in prison, he told Clay that he did not want to tell him but he did not say why he wanted to tell him that. He told Clay he was in debt but he did not owe money. After a few days of fighting he had apologized to Rodney but didn’t tell him that he felt guilty. When he talked to his wife she said that he was ashamed of himself and that he had to go home to bed. Clay lied to her and she told him that she should have told him that the money was his. After the conversation, Rodney’s mother told Clay that the money was his. Clay was also angry because Rodney said that he felt he should tell the truth but when he told Rodney about the accident and the truck accident he was injured. Rodney slapped him across the face and said he wanted to go home because he had not told the truth. After talking to his friend he told Clay that his wife deserved all that money and that he would do anything to get it back.","After spending four years chasing the President’s dreams of being rich and handsome, Clay Carter was enraged. He wanted his life back. He had been guilty of stealing the money of Rodney’s mother and he had even tried to robbing the president and his friends of any money they might have to show for it. That was when he decided to leave and start a life with nothing. He spent years trying to find someone and soon his hard work began to pay off, but he found no one. He sold the properties he had accumulated since his divorce from Rodney and tried to find a real job. But it was never easy. As he listened to the rumours of his demise, he would do anything to make his life complete. He forged an expensive passport, he forged a new driver’s license and he forged his name so that he would not be suspected of wrongdoing. The newspaper ran a story about how the president’s son had used his family’s wealth to bury his father and leave him without a will. Clay Carter tried to make amends and started preparing for another life as a wealthy American businessman. But in the meantime, he realized his family had given him the opportunity to create his own life by giving him all the money he needed to pay off the debts from his wife’s death. Clay Carter had already taken his father’s money and made millions, but Rodney had not been able to show that money to others. Eventually Rodney had to face the fact that he was not financially independent anymore and that he was going to be held responsible for the actions of his family. This was not a choice he would have made had he not rescued his sister from death at the hands of his evil uncle and had not acted in his best interest when he had first been a young boy. Now that he was older and wiser, he had made more money and more money, but he was only rich because he had done nothing wrong. He was still poor and broke because of the war in the Middle East, but his inherited money made him a billionaire. He also had been a politician in his youth, but now he was a state representative and he was not looking for re-election. If Rodney had not cheated on Clay Carter he would never have become president. He was the leader of the pack, a good father and a good person. A lot of people believed in him and his family, and he helped them through the turmoil and turmoil in the Middle East. Rodney Carter was accused of betraying his country to save his brother. Clay Carter’s father told Rodney that when he was young, he had to give up his son, and now that he was old and wise, he had to be the best person he could. As for his brother, Rodney was a hard man and a man of few words but had a great heart. Rodney Carter had the support of his family, including his brothers, but he was beaten and tortured by his father’s henchmen. Rodney Carter’s father abused him and he beat him. The tyrannies that forced him to be so weak didn’t stop him. They had to kill him, and he was thrown into prison, but he was released because he would never admit to the crimes he had committed. He would later die a broken man.","Clay Carter looks hot on the cover of Capitol Magazine.

C1,"Fresh produce is a powerful selling tool that tries to entice you to buy it as quickly as possible. But when it’s not, then what? The fruit and vegetables pictured in supermarkets are not always ripe to buy or are stale and rotting: they’ve been in the store for days before being sold. They might be frozen, soaked in a saltwater bath, or left in a dark room for weeks. This is a tactic that’s been known to create an emotional connection with shoppers. A supermarket that serves up fresh produce is far more likely to attract shoppers with this tactic than one that smothers stale or expensive items with a heavy film of ice. B. The image of convenience This has proven hugely successful. Research has shown that people who use public transport, for example, are more likely to buy from a supermarket that offers a free bus pass as a goodwill gesture. The free bus pass is another goodwill gesture: if you like the train, then you’re more likely to buy a ticket to the supermarket’s special offer train, as opposed to catching a bus back to the station. In order for this tactic to work, the store must have a great impression of a place to park the car or place a trolley. Alternatively, the space might feel empty with just a seat on one side. It’s a common tactic, and one that works because people know that there’s nothing much there. The only downside is that there are several disadvantages for this tactic. A. It’s harder to spot a parking spot. B. It isn’t obvious, making it harder to find. C. It can be unreachable. D. It feels overtly pushy. E. It’s a bit annoying. F. It’s very loud. G. It’s too big. H. It’s too loud. I. It’s not clearly labelled. It can be tempting to pick something up, but you end up taking it home with you. Having to stop your trolley is uncomfortable. E. You end up deciding that you really can’t afford it. F. The customer is forced to make a decision in about two seconds. G. It’s not a big-spending decision. H. It’s easy to resist. F. It’s overpriced. G. It doesn’t fit. H. The price is low. H. It doesn’t fit your budget. I. It’s small. I. It doesn’t add anything.","Whether it’s to lure you into a store or to get you to spend more than you intended, retailers know how to convince you to spend more. These tactics include making products look fresh, rearranging cluttered shelves, selling products at deep discounts and using a hypnotic, hypnotic voice to get you to buy. 1. This is a classic selling device, first shown to us in the 1940s. The idea is that the more customers you have in the store, the more likely they are to pick up additional items. “The most successful shopping technique is to let people see you in action in a way that is attractive to them, and to build up anticipation,” says the American marketing research firm Mintel. 2. This technique is more well-known, and it targets the younger demographic. “Our research suggests that more than a quarter of our consumers are older than 65,” says the team behind Mintel. “So it makes a lot of sense for brands to take advantage of that demographic,” says a marketing consultant. “Somebody who is a bit older is more inclined to be interested in products that are fresher or more unique,” adds the consultant. 3. This technique, also known as “refreshment psychology,” is based on a study done at Harvard. This suggests that people are more inclined to buy something that looks more fresher, and less likely to leave the store without making a purchase. “Even though the concept behind refreshment psychology isn’t new, it’s been around for decades,” says the marketing professor. 4. This technique is so effective that it can be used in stores and online as well. If you open a particular web page with a link to one of your favorite brands, your browser will present you with a list of products that are categorized by category. Some categories are so generic that they don’t compel you to buy something, but others may. This technique, called “sorting” and similar to what you might find in a supermarket, is an efficient way to keep you from browsing other merchandise. In addition to letting you know about these products, this strategy also encourages you to click on the link and enter the store. 5. You see this when you’re in a shop and a sale is on. This is when you get distracted by something you have seen but you don’t know what. It can be something like an offer for new clothes or beauty products. Here’s an example of how a woman was enticed by a new jacket in the window. She stopped and looked around. A man in a shirt was watching her and offered her some new clothes to try on. As you look at the jacket, you see that it had a small red, circular hole in it. “You are welcome to take a look at this jacket,” says the salesperson, pointing out the tag that says it has the coveted blue SPF 50 rating. 6. This technique is extremely successful because it makes the items look like they just came out of the store and don’t have a shelf life. It’s almost as if you’re being led into a store. “You don’t need to make a purchase; you can pick up something that looks good if you just walk in the door,” says the consultant. 7. The hysterics sound all very familiar, but they’re not really marketing tricks. Their purpose is to make you purchase things you don’t really need – like clothes that are only for a day, or food that you don’t really need to eat. The hysterics sound is also used to trigger a buyer’s interest in eating that food, or to make someone feel guilty about not buying it. 8. Having the perfect image of a sale means that a large, bright-colored sign draws the eye toward it. There are so many reasons why you’ll get enticed by this. The color is eye-catching, the shape is attractive, and the size doesn’t look out of place. 9. This is the perfect selling technique to make you eat more snacks and sweets. The goal of this technique is to persuade you to buy more items than you originally intended to buy. 10. This is a classic selling device that relies heavily on the power of association. The object is meant to make you feel a certain way. The price isn’t the same, but the price is significantly higher when compared to the other products on the shelf, making you want to purchase more of them. 11. This is a form of distraction, which can be used by a","In the summer, vegetables and fruits are the most popular shopping items, with 70 percent of respondents saying they always or almost always buy them from a store. But it’s important to remember that shoppers make a purchase for a reason, so that they can get rid of it in the next few days if they don’t like it. A key device supermarkets use to help you make a purchase is the image of freshness. To achieve this, supermarkets produce and food outlets stock shelves with fresh produce and display it in a way that encourages shoppers to make a purchase. A picture of a basket full of fresh produce conveys to shoppers that the produce is fresh. Shoppers are more likely to make a purchase when they see fresh produce, so supermarkets are able to display it in a way that makes it appear to be fresh. If they walk past fresh produce, their body language might tell them they need to buy the items and will be more tempted to do so. As soon as they enter the produce aisle, they may be encouraged to buy a larger, more expensive item. The aisle where fresh produce is displayed on shelves is called the “fresh food aisle,” because that is where most of the produce is displayed. This aisle is also called the “fresh produce” section. Fresh produce is generally shown in a bright, appealing way and is often on display in bright colours. If they don’t offer any fresh produce, there is often an image of a basket full of fresh produce on the shelf next to other foods. Fresh produce displays also show that the fresh products are fresh and ready to eat. In order to make people think of fresh produce, supermarkets might present it in an atmosphere that suggests that it is fresh. They might display fruit, vegetables and meat in attractive containers, as well as displaying fresh flowers, which can encourage shoppers to buy. There is an image of a deli shelf with fresh sandwiches and fresh milk. And if a customer enters this section and sees some fresh bread, they will often purchase some. Supermarkets sell fresh sandwiches and fresh milk so they are at least marketed as fresh. If someone enters the cheese section of a supermarket, they will be told that they should buy some fresh cheese, as they are not seeing it on a supermarket shelf. However, if a customer enters the fish section of a supermarket, they will be told that they should buy some fresh fish, as they are not seeing it on a supermarket shelf. Supermarkets try to make shoppers think that there is fresh meat in this section because they know that people will buy it and pay more for it. This image can also be portrayed on milk. Milk is a particularly popular snack in supermarkets and you are unlikely to buy any meat unless you are planning to cook. Also, the image of a large selection of products can give you the impression that the shelves are stocked with plenty of products.","Shopping is a fun pastime for some people – but for others it can have a significant impact on their bank account. A recent study found that over half of shoppers have increased their spending by £520 when they were asked to look at the prices of several items in a shop. 1. The smell of fresh cut flowers 2. The smell of ripe fruit or vegetables 3. The appearance of a selection of goods 4. The look of a plethora of goods 5. The scent of a shop 6. The size of a shop 7. A good display 8.

To help you avoid unnecessary spending, we’ve created a list of the 7 most common selling devices used in shops in the UK that we know work – and which you can avoid. 1. The freshness illusion: You’re enticed to buy fresh produce when it’s not – by displaying it on shelves with other fresh fruit and vegetables. However, this is a trick that’s not as effective when it comes to fruit. 2. The food stall concept: In supermarkets, when you see a range of different foods on the same stall, you feel like you have to pick which one to buy first. 3. The colour of the food stall: As you browse the food, the food is arranged in a way that looks fresh and vibrant. This catches your eye and makes you want to buy more. 4. The smell of the food: In our home we have a special food stall that is there to welcome us when we walk in. We have two different aromas, our favourite is sweet and fruity. Another popular fragrance is strong and spicy. 5. The price of the food: Almost every time we enter a supermarket, we are tempted to buy more and more. However, these are just two examples of selling devices. There are so many more – and we know some people are used to them so we are just going to mention them here. We will go through each of them in more detail in the future. We hope these tips will help you avoid some of the most common selling devices used in shops.","In talking shops, we have noticed that many things that we normally buy are actually a gift or a present to ourselves. One is that we think about how often we buy things like a DVD player, a new phone, or shoes. Some other things, we may only buy once or twice in our lifetime. We also notice a lot of people buying a large amount of merchandise. What are some of the other things that they might buy? B. The illusion of convenience and speed. When shopping, most people go from place to place looking for things to buy. If they aren't really sure what to buy then they shop around and search for different things. For example, on a Friday night we were in our supermarket and we were looking for something else. At that moment, we spotted a large display of red and white grapes and thought, if we don't buy this, I'll never like grapes again. What we did buy was actually four glasses of wine, two stuffed red grapes and two stuffed yellow grapes. A couple of weeks later we bought another five red and white grapes. We just didn't have room to fit them in our shopping bags. C. A lot of stores promote sales by flashing up bargains. So instead of telling us what we could buy, we were encouraged to spend a fortune.","A little later, we took our time taking it all in and were rewarded with a bit of sunshine and fresh air. A little later, we realized that the sun had taken its toll on a big box shop. The manager had to take some time out to get the staff out of the way and it wouldn’t have been done without the help of an icecream van. A quick internet search reveals that we can relive the sun bringing some very funny pictures. We even found out that many supermarkets don’t clean their own fruit and veg so we had to find another supplier. Another supermarket, one of our favourites, used a more advanced selling device – artificially placed lighting, to try to convince us to buy the most expensive brand they could offer. The light made our eyes bleed and made us want to buy it immediately."
C1,"Isabel has a problem with her knees. When she's asked to sit in on a painting workshop based in a museum in the Czech Republic, she decides to not wear jeans. When she attends the wedding of her friend and former college chum, she's forced to wear the kind of jeans she dislikes - a pair of blue denim with the rippling pattern you often see when a pair of jeans is torn: she looks worse when she wears them. She goes back to college to get the pair, and is surprised when she realises that when she's not wearing jeans she looks like an overly enthusiastic prankster. Her friends are astonished that Isabel would 'put up with it’ – even if there are problems. But her friend's friend doesn't. Is she right? And what of the pranksters around her? Isabel eventually stows her pair of blue denim jeans in her purse and takes them home, so that they're ready to use in the future when she wants to be in a relationship - and she ends up with a real suitor. But that's a story for another day. Isabel is an excellent character, both funny and witty.","Isabel is a 31-year-old art student in London. She studies contemporary art and romance. In her spare time, she loves to draw, paint and go on walks. This book is a good reversal of her original thoughts. She makes some friends, finds Mr Right, and takes it from there.","Isabel is a pretty girl. But she also likes to wear jeans. Especially skinny ones. She does not like to wear jeans. Isabel is a devotee of historical romances. She believes that her knobbly knees ruin her chances of finding Mr Right. When she starts e-mailing men interested in her, she’s desperate to find out who her first date will be and so has set out on a quest to find Mr Right. She joins various singletons groups, takes up a stall in a pub and eventually lands a date with the lovely Mr James. But he doesn’t seem very interested in her. Isabel does some research and discovers that he is actually a gangster! He’s also a thief with an axe to grind. She decides to go on an investigation of the mysterious disappearance of Mr James. She soon stumbles upon evidence of a heist in the local cinema by a serial killer, but soon realises that the police don’t seem to be interested in her and that all she’s really interested in is to get revenge. Isabel is a very wacky character, but at the same time she can be sympathetic to her situation, despite being quite self-absorbed. Her humour and quick wit mean that this is a surprisingly readable novel.","Isabel is a young woman studying at the University of Sydney. She enjoys reading about historical romances. Sadly she is not the person to be caught in a game of ""who likes you best?"" Isabel's only friend, Phyllis, is a teddy bear. She wants her friends to be friends first before trying to find someone to date. She is a bit of a flirt. Phyllis also has the habit of kissing men who are also women. Isabel decides not to get into any of it. When Phyllis is not answering her calls or texts, Isabel is forced to find Mr Right on her own. Mr Right is not what Isabel had hoped for. The book begins with Isabel standing at her kitchen sink in an ermine dress. Her father had bought her this dress because he wanted to buy her a gown for an art exhibition she was going to. Isabel’s mother has not bought Isabel a gown. This brings about a dramatic change in Isabel's perception of herself. She sees a mannequin in her bedroom and decides she wants to date Mr Right. However Mr Right is also very attractive. In a trance Isabel thinks Mr Right is going to have a girlfriend soon. She finds her grandmother dressed in a gown, so dresses herself in a petticoat for the evening. Isabel and Mr Right fall in love. It is not long before Isabel finds a good guy.","Isabel is an art student who lives alone in a small town in north England, where she spends her time working as a librarian. Her favorite subject is 19th century romance novels, but she has also encountered the odd crazed student, the boy she has been captivated by since she was a kid. With an easy smile and a bright wit, she has always been one to put people before herself. The first book Isabel reads is 'Chasing Mr Right' by Barbara Cartland. This is about a girl seeking the perfect man - a man who will love her no matter what. It begins with a visit to a cafe where the writer is giving his talks, only to be met by the waiter. He offers Isabel some flowers, but she accepts. The waiter does not like it. He is in a hurry, and does not think a single flower looks good, but Isabel says she will 'go away in a minute and come back'. As he departs, Isabel and Mr Cartland kiss, the sun comes out and so does Mr Cartland's wife. It is obvious that everything is going to be okay. Isabel meets Mr Cartland's daughter-in-law. They get married and Isabel is in bliss. Mrs Cartland is not very pleased. But the two also begin to bond over their love of art and the beauty of antiques. Isabel's relationship with Mr Cartland is different to any other relationship she has had. They share a deep respect for both their families, their art and their country - and that has to do with Mrs Cartland’s artistic talent. As they spend time together, Isabel finds that she has inherited Mr Cartland’s artistic abilities, and it turns out that Isabel has inherited the same talents - she is an expert at painting. Isabel tells Mr Cartland what has happened after being married. She describes her first date with Mr Cartland: 'I went to the supermarket looking for a dress. I found the right one there, and I told him about my shoes.' Mr Cartland has been in love with Isabel since he was a child, and he has come to stay with her parents, so he explains how they met. She goes on to say that she had to wait for him to get the right clothes, because he was afraid of leaving. He also tells her that he is sorry he was unable to keep up with Isabel, and that it had caused a lot of problems. He was very engrossed in the whole process of looking for his bride, from meeting the right dress to the right man. Mrs Cartland reveals that Isabel and Mr Cartland had both started their own paintings, which she drew while she was on her internship with Mrs Cartland's parents at a nearby art college. They both loved them and it seemed like it would be a good marriage for them. Isabel and Mr Cartland, though now completely out of touch, have a wonderful relationship, which is borne out by the affection they share for each other and for the country. The reader also learns about Mrs Cartland, who has suffered as a result of her past, and about a country town called Ashbury, where she spent the first part of her life. Isabel, Mr Cartland and her family, who are also the subject of Isabel's admiration, discover that one of her aunts was a famous art teacher, but her husband had been a professional athlete. In addition, Isabel discovers that the eldest daughter of the family has a similar personality to the aunt of the bride. Eventually Mr Cartland and Mrs Cartland marry and raise a family.","Isabel's life takes a dramatic turn when her roommate, Max, a self-described ‘eccentric’, suggests she 'get to the bottom of it’. Isabel wants to be married, but has to confront her fear that if she marries the wrong guy, she will be criticized and ridiculed by others for her age. She must also learn to stop feeling embarrassed by her knees.","Isabel wants to marry Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. The reason is obvious: she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.

C1,"Sleep is believed to have a vital role in brain development, memory formation and disease prevention. However, why a single person ages so rapidly is still in debate. A study published in the journal Sleep found: ""It seems certain, therefore, that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still far from being agreed upon."" A group of scientists have now uncovered new evidence that, as with other parts of the brain, sleep may be necessary to protect the brain from injury, or to repair it after injury. Their findings show that when we are in deep sleep, our muscles become sore, which is a sign that we were injured, but that we did not cause the injury. When they were awake, the same area showed minimal improvement. And when their muscles recovered, they could no longer resist a shock. The new findings suggest that stress can be helpful in repairing the brain: ""The biggest reason why people are more stressed is stress,"" says the study, published in the journal Neuropsychiatry. ""If you haven't exercised in a while, then it can take a long time for the brain to recover."" A healthy metabolism is important for learning and memory, and there is a clear link between high energy levels and good sleep. ""The more energy you have, the faster you can learn,"" says the study's lead author and neuroscientist, Dr Rebecca Smith, also of Neuropsychiatry. ""Research shows that our body burns more calories as we sleep than we burn as we awaken."" While there are several studies that have shown that sleep helps people get better at problem-solving, such as the ones led by Dr Smith, it is still a mystery why people snore. To determine the cause of snoring in human beings, researchers took snores from 406 adults. The first 20 were tested after six weeks. The brains of the other 20 were collected after a month and kept on for seven years. The researchers found that after two weeks of snoring, the participants' brains began to shrink and their memories worsened. It turns out that the brains of people who slept more, including those who didn't snore at all, were less healthy. There's also a theory that the brain shrinks in individuals with certain medical conditions. Some studies show that people suffering from sleep apnea need to stay in bed for some time when they try to fall asleep. But in people with sleep apnea, it becomes easier to fall asleep and wake up when they want to. A paper published in a medical journal, Sleep, shows that some people who are sleep apnea suffer from more serious health problems than others. And, unlike other sleep disorders, they get worse with age. People who suffer from sleep apnea also have trouble making sense of things and feel better. In a third study, researchers looked at a number of factors that might explain why sleeping with a partner increases aggression and makes people less patient. Sleep deprived people are also less likely to volunteer to help their partner out or take a bigger part in their partner's life, especially if they aren't given the option to sleep with another person at the same time. ""We know that a partner with a sleep disorder tends to have fewer sleep problems,"" says lead author Jennifer Nicoletti, who studies a variety of personality disorders in children, including anxiety disorders. And in a further study, she and her colleagues used a database of thousands of interviews with people suffering from sleep problems to uncover a few common traits. A third theory has a little more wiggle room: if sleep actually allows us to build muscles and repair tissue, then we would be the fittest humans on Earth, says the paper's lead author. ""If you believe that waking up is the best way to keep our bodies healthy, then you could argue that sleep is just a waste of time,"" he says. ""But if you believe that there's some mechanism behind people needing sleep, then you could argue that sleeping with a partner gives us some sort of advantage in coping with the demands of daily life.""","Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still being debated. Scientists are far from being agreeable about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep.",Why do we sleep? Why are we so bad at staying awake? Why do we all have the same sleep patterns? Here are three theories of sleep to consider.,"Three theories about sleep. Physicists and researchers are not entirely sure what the true purpose of sleep is. The answer to this question is far from being settled. This article is part of the series entitled A Little Bit About sleep. I think it should be called A Bit About Sleep Part I. I think it should be called A Bit About sleep Part II. Some of the theories about sleep are based on the fact that we sleep a lot. For example, a British scientists study found that when people go to sleep, they wake up more tired than when they sleep awake. I think this may be partly because the body slows down the brain. So, when we go to sleep, the brain does not have to worry so much about the stress of the day. Another theory is that we need to sleep to stay healthy. Some of the studies found that the brain recovers faster when it is stressed. I think that is a theory that is not entirely reliable. Finally, some scientists believe that sleep improves our immune system and our mood. They have found that people who got a sleep deficit were more likely to get sick. I think that this would be a theory that is more reliable.","A theory of sleep has long been circulating, but the idea that it plays a very specific role in life is still disputed by many researchers. It claims, for example, that sleep is an essential part of memory consolidation. This idea would seem to be supported by the findings of a study on the human brain in 2010, titled “How do neurons remember?”, which suggests that when we think of something, a portion of our brain is engaged while the memory is being stored. A second theory relates that sleep resembles the process of learning in that it is a way of re-training our brains to make sense of the information we are acquiring. These results show that we don’t necessarily need to learn new information, but that learning is a process involving a series of steps in a series of stages. Each successive stage is characterized by the amount of memory that is retained by the brain. Some neuroscientists say that sleep acts as a type of learning machine. Sleep seems to be a good training tool. We can think about the future, plan for the future, and learn about life. Some neuroscientists have long suggested that the brain stores information during sleep, while others think that this is only a nihilistic waste of time, which makes waking up in the morning seem a waste of precious time. One theory also points to sleep as an essential part of the nervous system repair and maintenance. One theory says that it restores brain power after stressful life experiences, a theory supported by numerous studies. Another theory states that sleeping allows us to become stronger and more resilient. Finally, a theory says that it helps to make us more productive.","Three theories about sleep are still under debate. Some people think that sleep may help humans get a better start in life, while others think that sleep can help us get rid of bad habits that make us feel stupid. Some believe that sleep can boost the immune system, while others are concerned that sleep is good for our weight loss.","Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still up for debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. One theory suggests that sleep improves our performance on the day by making our muscles more agile. This theory suggests that sleep can help us make improvements in memory and the ability to learn. A second theory is that sleep might help us to lose weight. This theory suggests that sleep might help to lose weight and build muscle. This theory suggests that sleep might help to lose weight.

C1,"An office space can affect your health and happiness, and if your work environment is not fit for purpose it can actually make you sick and can make you sick. Offices can be a key factor in affecting our mental health, physical health and productivity, according to a survey of 425 employees who voted in the latest UK Workplace Wellness Report. The findings show that some people genuinely enjoy their workplaces, however, some people struggle to feel happy and happy in their working environment, even when the climate outside is perfectly fine and sunny. According to the experts surveyed, the number one way to do this is to provide good air quality, particularly in an open plan office space. A healthy air quality level of 67% is deemed as good, and a healthy air quality level of 74% is deemed as good. A healthy air quality of 69% for an open plan office would be classed as excellent and an open plan office environment would be considered as good. The respondents also scored a mark of 69% for good lighting, and a 7% mark for sufficient daylight. Some people were extremely pleased that the office had good lighting, while others were disappointed. The experts agreed that poor lighting, poor lighting and draughty offices were at the root of many health problems including snoring and allergies. Many of the participants believed that they were “happy and healthy” inside the office space they worked in, but 65% rated their overall health and happiness level as “poor” – an improvement on the 47% that they were rated as ‘good’. They did however agree that the overall level of happiness was “very high” which amounted to 60%. This survey, carried out in 4 contrasting offices across the UK, was carried out in accordance with research guidelines set out by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This report provides a benchmark for the health and happiness of the UK’s workplace workforce and is the first to examine how workplaces influence happiness and well-being in the workplace.","A research team from University College London has visited 4 contrasting offices. They found that a healthy office that provides enough fresh air and encourages people to use healthy seats at their desks was found to be happier and healthier than an office that didn’t have natural light or enough ventilation or a view. The study also looked at office furniture, lighting, ergonomics and office décor. The office design was also measured, to find out how happy the employees were.","There aren’t many office environments that the experts have studied where people can’t sit comfortably for more than eight hours a day. They say that the amount of natural daylight, fresh air and the type of chair used when sitting in those spaces all have an effect on how happy employees are. However, when all four offices we went to had only three in common and these were: an office with little natural daylight; a small, dark and cramped office with light being constantly shone into the space; and a huge corporate office with a huge glass wall. Our expert panel was comprised of a building health consultant; an ergonomist who studies people’s working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. The four offices we visited were divided up into three categories. The first was the biggest corporation where the people were most happy and were the ones with the most natural daylight, the second the second largest company where there was little natural light and more artificial lighting; and lastly the smallest company which was very small but had a lot of natural daylight. We then rated the four offices against the criteria we had set in advance by a professional, with five different categories. There were four basic scores to assess the environment; with the highest score awarded being the worst one. This was awarded to the first category of the lowest quality office. The experts went to the offices and assessed their interiors. They were compared with over 32,000 office spaces in 20 countries. The offices were divided into groups of two: office spaces that had at least five windows; and office spaces that had less than three windows. They also looked at the lighting and the chair used. We found the average offices to have the most natural daylight. The lowest was the darkest office of the four, with just two windows in the room. These had little natural daylight or fresh air. The air was dry and had a lot of mould, whereas the most organic office had good natural light. The experts also looked at the chairs and found the highest scores given for comfort, back support and body posture. Offices were rated based on the comfort and support of the chair. In the greenest office, it had three windows.","When our panel of experts visited four offices, they were surprised that the top three, each of which had one of the UK’s busiest airports, each had very different environmental characteristics. The most productive offices had plenty of light, airy spaces and good chairs for sitting in. They also had clean toilets and lots of clean, fresh air. However, one office had an ominous smell that kept people awake at night.","Fresh air and the right chair can make a big difference to people’s mental and physical health. A new report from A2 Languages suggests that people in offices with good ventilation and comfortable, supportive chairs have healthier, happier and more productive working lives. The office environment has a direct effect on people’s mental and physical health, according to the research into the wellbeing of staff in the UK, published in the journal Lancet Neurology. In the first of four offices, we visited four different places, one of them the home of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and four others that had an office setting that had both health benefits and was also a happy place to work. We asked people about their personal experiences of healthy workplaces, about the factors that made them happier in their workplaces and about the effect their office environments had on their mental health. All the respondents provided their answers to our questions on a short scale, with a 0 – 1 meaning they felt comfortable and a 9 – 10 meaning that they were uncomfortable. Our expert panel agreed that good ventilation, good seating and a healthy workspace are key elements in improving the wellbeing and health of the workforce. Fresh air topped the list of happiness factors, with 92% rating the air they breathed as healthy and 87% rating the space as happy. The expert panel were surprised by some of the answers they received. Many of the answers were about fresh air and a relaxing environment while others were about stress and other negative factors.","After taking a look at four different offices, we measured workers’ happiness and health to find out which offices offered the best working environment. All four are in London. We asked workers at each office, how many people were in their office, how many people were eating and drinking, and how many had a pleasant and pleasant office. All four offices have plenty of natural light and fresh air, though some are closed in because they don’t let enough natural light in. Only one office has air conditioning. But in all four offices, we saw employees feeling happy and healthy in their work environment. What is the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level? This story was written by Jane Goff, a grade 2 writer, and published on the NPR website on September 20, 2018.","Fresh air and comfortable chairs are the keys to a happy and healthy workplace. Four very different offices were inspected by experts. First they viewed four different office spaces. In the middle was a very bright space with a nice view. In the right side of the picture was a room with windows that let in lots of natural light. Across the room was a room that was mostly empty. The left side featured a room that was much darker and had windows on three sides. The right side was a bright and modern place with a good view. On the left side were offices which were both well lit but remained relatively dark. The right side was a very dark space, but had a large window. Finally a room which had no windows."

I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I didn't want to wake her up this morning, so I went to bed. When I got up I found her lying on the floor licking her lips. I put the top of the bottle on her breast. She started sniffing. I looked at her and saw she had a sock over her head. I stepped over and put my hand over her cheek. I whispered to her, ""Brother, please do not get sick. I feel so sick."" She went to bed and looked at me. I knew she was tired, but I just couldn't believe that she was sleeping on the sofa when I picked her up. I tucked her in and put the top of the bottle in her mouth. I felt bad for her, but she needed a snack. When I got back to her I gave her the sock. She said to me, ""Brother, when you come back and talk to me you will be so weak. Thank you for making it easy for me to help you. That is what being a father is all about."" I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute.

C1,"I can’t say I had a specific plan about how to stop smoking but I decided it would be better to make a list of ten things I was grateful for. When I arrived at my office the morning after the day I stopped, there was an amazing feeling of gratitude that filled me. The air was crisp and fresh. The sunshine was brighter and the birds were singing. My stomach was full and a flutter of excitement ran through me. I was bursting with optimism. It wasn’t a moment wasted. I was free of nicotine for the first time in years. I bowed to the collective sigh of relief and thanked my colleagues. It was wonderful to no longer have to make excuses for my bad behaviour, for smoking was not in my destiny any more. I walked to the front door and walked in.","A few months before my last cigarette, I had started to have morning cravings. I knew they were an irritant, but I could never explain why. I was tired and anxious and felt sick most of the day. I could not think clearly or make myself laugh, so I awoke one morning feeling nauseous, hungry and shaky. I made my way to the toilet, took a quick shower and dressed straight away. After a few minutes I looked out of the window and realised I was looking at a sea of clouds. I looked up and saw a huge spout of water. I looked down to see a huge puff of tar and wondered what had caused me to puff it so much. I thought about it for a few minutes, then thought about the reasons why I continued to smoke. I knew it would affect my health in a negative way, and I also knew it would make me sick. So I decided it wasn’t worth the risk of a heart attack and was going to give up cigarettes for good. I got up and headed back to work, then took another shower and had an espresso. Before I knew it I was no longer a smoker.",The day I gave up smoking I thought everyone would be pleased but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. ‘What do you mean?’ she raged. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day life-long smoker and four hours later I was not was faintly irritating.,"I was terribly disappointed. I always found it hard to believe that a few hours ago I had been in a cigarette shop, buying three cigarettes. Now I wasn’t, but I couldn’t explain how and why this had happened. For some reason I always thought that quitting was much more difficult than I had made it out to be. Smoking has caused some serious illnesses. The first few days had been incredibly difficult and I wondered why I had got to the point of not having to even think about it. Fortunately, my mother had been there when I started, and she’d just kept her hand on my arm as I started to make the transition. It was only a matter of time before I would be back to my old habits. I’m sure it was partly because I didn’t want to get a cold and it was hard to stop. But as time went on I began to notice that I just didn’t have the same urge to have a cigarette. I did, however, relapse from time to time so I knew that one day I had to make a decision. That’s the day I quit smoking.","The day I gave up smoking was so quick I didn’t think the others would have noticed. After the first session I was no longer hungry, thirsty or irritable. In fact I was very happy I hadn’t given up. After a few days I realised that I was much more tired than usual. I also realised that I was no longer in control. I still have to go to the toilet a lot, but I always try to do it at intervals. I don’t think it was just a mental thing. I know that if I walked into a room of smokers and began to smoke I’d be much more likely to get sick. It’s all about the chemicals in the cigarettes. There is just nothing else like it and I will never get them out of my system again. I also realised that I would rather die of cancer than smoke.","The day I gave up smoking was a day I will never forget. I walked into my office and there in front of me was a large box of cigarettes. I opened it and popped one. I don’t even know how long I stood there in complete shock. I looked at my partner and said ‘You don’t want to smoke?’ He smiled and said ‘You’re right.’ I told him I had quit smoking four hours before. I had not. I looked down at the empty box, and then I realised it was me. ‘What do you mean?’ I asked. ‘What do you mean?’ he said. ‘If it was that easy why didn’t you stop years ago?’ He threw out the box, swore at me and said ‘I didn’t want to smoke?’ I stood there stunned for a moment. I couldn’t tell him why I was still smoking. I just knew.","It wasn’t easy, of course. It took a lot of willpower and a lot of determination and I’m not sure anyone would have believed me had it not been for a doctor telling me I had a lung cancer that could have lasted a lifetime. So I did the only thing I could do and in the end I was relieved. The next day, I went down to the shop and bought a pack of cigarettes and was suddenly out of breath. I was delighted. I told my colleague that it hadn’t been easy but, of course, she had to take some blame for why I couldn’t have stopped years ago."
C2,"While I enjoy digital content, a lot of what I write is done on my blog. I recently started to explore the idea of creating short stories with a series of prompts ranging from a ‘be careful what you wish for’ theme through to a ‘writing on the edge’ theme. One of the prompts on the list is about writing a poem. My second thought was that this would take longer than a single paragraph. This has proved more or less true. I’ve written two short stories since I got a short story competition entry last year. The first short story was inspired by an accident a couple of years ago. I had been thinking about the last poem I wrote for my competition and wondered how I could create a short story in a relatively short amount of time. After putting it in my journal, I looked back through my old handwritten essays and was surprised at how few changes I had made. Today I would have rewritten those five times over.","Last year, I was at the school library with my sister. We were reading ‘The Shrew’ by George Orwell. I noticed that there was a sentence that didn’t make any sense and that there were too many periods. I also noticed that there was a sentence with a capital letter that shouldn’t have been used. We thought it was very clever. I wondered how that got in there as I would have had to cross it out if I had written it by hand! I also noticed that I didn’t write many lines in my book, which was a skill I had never had to learn in school. I thought about the things that were important to me as a child and why I thought they were so important as young adults. I thought about what I liked to do at home, but also about what I didn’t like about my life. It made me think a lot about how I felt about those things. I realised that what makes me happy is my family. The way my family treats me is important to me. I like to spend time in the kitchen with them and play outside with them. When I am playing with them they all like me just as much. I like to spend time with the things I love and the ones that I can’t do without because I feel that they are important in my life. I like to spend time with people who are different and I love to spend time with people that are like me. I love sharing and enjoying time together. The way my parents teach me to speak the language is important to me because I find that they teach the same things to their children. I also love to talk to them and I love to share things with them too. In my childhood, I always felt that books were an important part of my life, but I realized that I wasn’t allowed to read the books that I wanted to read. In school I didn’t know any of the stories that I would read as a teenager. I had no idea that I would become a writer, that I would become successful, that I would become a speaker. In my own home, I learned how to read books with my family and friends, but I still didn’t really write. I think that was because I didn’t have enough time to read books. In the end my brother and I decided that we did better learning to write on computers and books instead. I am very grateful for all the support I received from my parents, teachers and friends who all encouraged me to write my own stories and books. I hope that my story can give my readers a good idea of what I’m made of, but I do know that there will still be those who are sceptical and think that things that I write aren’t going to make sense. I have decided that the best advice that I can give to anyone who asks me to write anything for them is: Read, read, read! Writing is an art and you will be amazed at what you can come up with. My writing experience in school helped me learn that there are very few writers in my future. It taught me that I can’t write like a great writer, I have to write like a great speaker and that I don’t need to be a great speaker. You must write like a great speaker and that is something that I will always remember.","My school essay was on English literature and history. The piece did not get a mark but because it was written by hand it is one of my best handwritten pieces. Writing by hand is the best way to learn, but it is also much harder to produce. In fact, it would be more challenging if I used pen and paper but because of the reliance on computers I only had one handwriting paper to write in at a time. The only time I went handwriting was for my English examinations at school and university. At home I would get frustrated by the amount of time I spent on screen. I also hated wasting time writing by hand because it was harder than typing but it was also less fun. Writing by hand allows me to use all my faculties because I can write down my thoughts in one go and I cannot lose them if I lose the paper. I can see that when I am on screen I am forced to pay attention and use all my skills. I feel more focused and attentive with pen and paper. I love the feel of writing by hand. I will never stop doing it, but I will have to work harder to produce writing that is worthy of a mark.",...what was written without effort is in general read without pleasure'. I can only remember my teacher's comment: What's written without effort is in general read without pleasure? He was just right. It is so much harder writing by hand than it is writing on the screen.,"My first time writing in handwriting I was terrified of losing all my ideas on the way. I remember trying to cram in as many words as possible while ignoring the space available. It was a panic filled feeling, in my opinion. It takes an enormous amount of concentration to write something that is worth reading, and I knew that I had been unconsciously pushing the limits of my patience. Unlike the written word I found the digital version of writing so easy to edit, but so painful to type out, that I decided to do it in two ways. First I crossed my answers into a Google document so that everyone could see and critique them. This was a time consuming process that took a lot of time and mental energy to complete, but the end result was worth it. I was able to rework my essay and get it to the standard I wanted. On the second go I drew a box around each of my answers so that they were more consistent. On the final try I checked my notes in a Google Doc to make sure they were correct, then I printed out the version of the paper I had handwritten. I think that I realised that I needed to rewrite more of my answers and therefore did it twice, which was much easier. I also started to write in an old-fashioned handwriting style again so that I could feel my ideas flow better as I wrote, although with my limited attention span this took a lot of time. Eventually I realised that I needed a new style and made a vow to write every day at some point. This was still harder than I thought and still takes me hours to get anything to look ‘right’ but when you think about it it really isn’t that hard. You just have to get your attention to it. I am sure it will happen once I have mastered it. The final proofread was a very lengthy process, involving many meetings with my teacher and parents. We had to discuss what to change so that the end result was something that I felt was clear and coherent. This was a very important part of my development as a writer and was an exercise I didn’t regret. I’ve come to the conclusion that when we write, it needs to be as clear and precise as possible. I decided to rewrite my last paragraph to help me refocus. If I’d had more time at the beginning, I would have made much less changes and would have achieved the same result.",Writing by hand and on screen Dr Johnson maintained that ‘what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure’. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained.

C2,"There was a traffic light to my left, it was just before the corner with Washington Avenue. I saw two men walking down the road, I asked them if they were police. The second man said no, I thought for a moment, then he saw me. I ducked in between a couple of cars. He continued down the street. I could still see his face through the black hood. A hand held a pistol to his side, the gun slipped into his pocket. He raised his arm and fired at me, my hand trembled as I drew my gun back. The gun went off and I felt a strong stinging coldness to my skin. I took a step backwards. I had already slid between the cars. I felt a soft stinging to my skin, but couldn’t see him. I opened my hand and felt my face flush with red, my hand had prickly texture to it, it smelt of hot tar. I’m sorry. You can’t take my gun away. I knew he was going to take it away from me. That’s what I had done. I stepped back and scanned the street. I took another step towards the man. I stumbled backwards into his arms. Then he jerked his head back slightly and the hand shot me again. This time it went right through my ribcage. My knee twitched, my hand shook, I fumbled with my gun. I found it and fired it back. My hand twitched again. I quickly ducked in between two men to save my life and I knew I had time. The second man shot me three times, but one of the shots went right through me and hit me. I turned around and stared at the man. I saw a twisted arm with a claw on it. His eyes were bloodshot and he had a big beard. It was a fake beard, it felt like a spider’s web. I was about to panic, but I stopped myself. “It wasn’t a fake, it was just a really strong beard.” He winced and his face suddenly became brighter. “It’s not really fake but it’s pretty much the exact same beard. The hair is the same, too,” I said. “Yes, there are real claws on his arm that can grab onto me and pull me down.” He smiled and pointed to his face. “Oh, it’s just a fake, just a fake, right?” he asked calmly. I stared at the man for a moment and leaned back to catch my breath. The man then turned around and strode off. “There’s still a long way to go, but if you come through there’s a way up here.” The man just paused his walking and let me pass.","Suddenly, I sensed something. I looked around quickly and spotted a figure skulking down Philadelphia Avenue that was a tallish figure about 5 feet tall. I didn’t have much time to recognize the figure because a few minutes later, the rain had stopped. With only a moment to spare, I turned my head and quickly headed toward the shadowy figure in the opposite direction. I slowed down and took in the sight. There in that darkened alleyway was a man in a dark coat sauntering across the street towards me. He seemed to be on some sort of high alert. The rain was getting heavier and heavier with each passing second. It felt like the rain had flooded the street and taken the ground away from me. Before I could react, I could feel his arm swish and turn against me. A strong presence in the street, a man with a long beard that was almost black, his body coiled up tightly around a dark stuffed animal, his face twisted back on itself. It seemed that he had some sort of connection with the other man. My feet sank into the wet pavement and I fell to the ground. I hit my head on the concrete and my ankles started to tremble. I saw a sliver of light through the corner of the alley and realized that the man was still alive. He stumbled and looked around as if his body had disintegrated under his weight, but as if somehow, the life he’d just gained was somehow better than the dead life he’d previously lived.","I took a small shortcut up the other side of Philadelphia Avenue, heading straight through the tree. Upon reaching the street, I paused to enjoy the view as well as the breeze. An uncanny familiarity grew among the trees, as it is to all who can see it. The shadows stretched out wide on the street, giving me a sense of warmth against the coolness of the air. In the distance, I saw a white car. My head spun around to see something white and barefoot in the road in the distance. I turned and caught sight of a woman sitting on a curb in front of me. The woman looked up at me with her white hands clenched together. She sat down without even blinking. Her gray eyes glowed in the dim light. The woman’s expression was sad, and she wore a thin white sleeveless jacket and a dark grey cap that drooped revealing one black eye. The woman shook her head in a grimace and stepped back from the road. The woman sat down with her hands on the floor and began to read my journal. I was astonished to read about the time that I first met her. Her words had pierced my heart and made me see the world through a different angle. I could picture her looking at me with pride, knowing I had a penchant for mysteries. I knew how much she hated me. Then again, I had no idea why she would want to see me beaten to death.","Suddenly, I saw someone behind me. I knew that he was not a local. I couldn’t say anything, though I could see the expression on his face. It took me a moment to process how unnerving this would be for a first-time user of the underground. If he was a local, he had a legitimate concern. He wanted to be alone for as long as possible. This man was not a local. My brain convulsed. I had taken a chance and crossed the road. It was already past dusk. I had only just arrived at a gas station. The other residents of Philadelphia were probably having the same thought. They were leaving to head to the beach. Maybe not for a few hours, but probably for a month or more. For the next few days, I would just sit and wait. I started thinking of things I could have said to him. I walked over to the other gas station. I sat down on the bench and took deep breaths. I felt the air change in my lungs. The humidity had thickened. I tried to calm myself down. I tried to think about what he might have thought I might have said. I wanted to think if there was any possibility that he might have had an idea of what I might be planning on doing. Maybe I would have done something different. Maybe I would have walked home. But I couldn’t. There was only this thought in my head. He would have walked home. I had no choice. I could still walk home, of course. But I knew I was not going to slouch over and tell him something I had heard previously. He had no right to hear what I had to say. Maybe it was his fault and I had no right to ask him. I thought for a moment. He could have been a person like me, just as I was, and I could have seen his doubts. I could have pushed him out of my way and just walk home. But he wouldn’t listen to me. My mind began to race. My thoughts were blurry. I could hear nothing but the sound of the prickly drizzle. My sense of smell was sharpened. I felt the warmth of the radiator in my jacket. I realized I wasn’t just a human. I could feel another person. His life. He was like me. There was a lot of power in him. There was a lot of love in his eyes.","The rain was heavier now and the prickly drizzle felt eerily suffused with a sharpness I hadn't felt in weeks. The wind felt tepid and pliable, a perfect excuse to stealthily sneak down the street and find someone to talk to. When I got to the corner of West 9th Street and Philadelphia Avenue the temperature had dropped to about 15 degrees Celsius. I felt slightly clumsy. As I walked, I thought to myself what it would take for the stranger to notice me. Surely, the person who just walked by would see me a mile away. But I noticed that as I made my way down the street I found myself turning into a rut. I walked all the way down until I came to the main intersection. Then, I continued towards the crosswalk. As I approached, I turned around and made a left hand turn. The person walking toward me was a young man in a black hooded sweatshirt. He had long dark hair and wore a hat that he did not need. He was dressed in the black hoodie that I saw him wearing, but he wore nothing but his sunglasses. He wore a leather jacket. I looked around in disbelief, but then he did nothing as I went past. I walked on a shaky path. A lot of people were walking along Philadelphia Avenue at that time. The crowd gathered as the sun set. I walked past the people on the left side of Philadelphia Avenue and started heading into town. I kept on walking past the empty stores. Finally, when I saw a sign that read ""Philadelphia Avenue Parking Garage"", I stopped right in the middle of the street and turned left. The parking garage was already fully occupied. I got out of my car, went into the parking garage, then looked at the car. It was empty as far as I could see.",The weather had gotten better.,I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened the humidity thickened into a palpable prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. My brother-in-law didn't look up from his smartphone.

C2,"A few days ago, I noticed an advert for Einstein chocolate bars in the newspaper. I’d had them for years as a kid and so thought they were great and would be worth buying a box. When I went to check it out I discovered they were in fact chocolate bars with a different name. They weren’t chocolate bars but rather brownies, supposedly in tribute to Albert Einstein. As I picked up my new favourite, I noticed a very familiar face sitting in the back of the box, a male model in a black suit. At first I thought he must be the owner, but in fact, it was one of a number of models on the bar. I was a little shocked to see the face of the man that I thought was my friend. When I looked at the box it was really only the logo of a chocolate company that was on it, a hologram of Einstein. Having been in the UK for a number of years, I knew the logo was just a copy of the logo from an advertisement for a chocolate company. The fact I recognised this didn’t stop me buying the chocolate bars. After all, that was their advertising jingle so it made sense they were the owners. The fact that it was a male model as well gave me the feeling of being connected to someone. When I took the box home I realized the strange thing was I wasn’t the only person that had had my chocolate bars and wanted to learn how to make them so I got a little creative and made my own! The first thing I did was to create four different chocolate bars based on his likeness. The centre of each bar had to be a photograph of Einstein in his heyday with a red bow adorning his nose. I then added the other details of my chocolate bars. I wrote that he had blonde hair, an apple face and the number 42 on the back. I also included a reference to the famous quote of his ‘I never knew until now’ referring to the fact he spent a lot of time looking out of his window. On the top of each bar was a small photograph of Einstein. I drew a straight line in my sketch and the colour was made with a paint brush. The final stage was to layer a red and black coloured chocolate mousse over the top of the chocolate bar. I was able to create the effect of Einstein’s hat forming a symmetrical pattern which would eventually become the basis of the chocolate bar’s logo. To give the chocolate bar a bit more texture I added a red and black sugar skull to the top. I also decorated the top of the chocolate bar with gold stars. The final step was to add a golden foil ribbon around the base. I cut this ribbon in half and then ran it across the top of the chocolate bar and tied the string to hang it on the wall. I created a number of chocolate bars that I used for my chocolate bars and I am very proud to say that the chocolate bars I made were well received. The chocolate bar is made from milk chocolate and has a dark chocolate centre. The chocolate covered strawberries adds a very nice contrast and the addition of the sugar skull gives it a real chocolate feel.

In this spot-the-science story, a boy sees an Einstein in an ad for a computer and wants to know why.","When Albert Einstein died in 1945 he was considered to be the greatest scientist of all time. The man’s name was so popular that a statue of him was built in New York at the New York Public Library to commemorate him. It was paid for with gifts from his friends who gave his statue free entry to the museum. Einstein’s popularity had not been helped by the fact he was born in 1879, a year before most people had seen him in person. At the time the museum wasn’t able to sell his statue and only a small section of the sculpture was on display. It was used to advertise various products and services in a bid to encourage people to buy the product. This gave the statue a very personal connection to many people. People often associate the statue of Einstein with technology and knowledge, and as a result many of the most successful products in the world use his face. His popularity could also be explained by his famous work. Having achieved a lot in his lifetime, Einstein was considered a genius by many people and by many societies. He was voted into the Royal Society for his scientific and philosophic achievements, as well as being recognised as a person of intelligence and curiosity. Many people regard him as a scientist as he understood and explained mathematical concepts to many people, such as how Newton formulated his theories and how gravity affected Newton’s work. The scientific concept of relativity is one of Einstein’s most influential ideas. It shows the properties of matter that is considered one of the foundations of science. In his theory of relativity, he claimed the existence of an invisible wave caused by the energy that flows along the surface of a body as the mass of an object moves along it. The theory also shows that a change in acceleration is linked to the movement of the object along the surface of the body. Many scientific theories like this are used to understand the universe. They also explain how a person can be created, how certain states of matter can be created, how matter can be converted into energy, etc. These theories often lead to the discovery of new and innovative technology and re-used. The theory of relativity is very well known around the world. Einstein, in this case, was the first scientist in history to apply it. Einstein was also a very intelligent person who had an intellectual background and this is probably why he enjoyed reading encyclopaedias. It showed the importance of knowledge and information in life and shows the interdependence of our mind. One of the most famous aspects of Einstein’s life was his great invention of the scientific calculator. He used this tool to understand how different measurements could be calculated. For example, to get an accurate estimate of the angular velocity, it would need to be multiplied by the speed of light. He also invented the Newtonian meter, which could be used to accurately calculate how fast the earth is moving. This was such a useful invention that even today it is still used by universities. A famous example is the method of applying this method on the atom, which is the basis for all atomic energy. Using these methods, it was possible to measure the mass of objects. By using the atom as the unit of measurement for different kinds of weights and lengths, scientists can use the data on the weight of a single object in order to make a prediction for that object in order to save energy. One could also calculate how many revolutions of the Earth a year would take. During the 1890’s, the science fiction novel “The Brothers Karamazov” was published by the United States based writer Arthur C Clarke. The story is about a cyborg named “Ahmad Ali” who is based in the Soviet Union. He explains how alien technology allowed for the development of spaceships and what life would be like if we existed in a universe made up of small planets. Many sceptics think that this type of sceptic thinks that aliens will attack earth at any time, without prior warning, leaving scientists and people who are ignorant of the science at a disadvantage.

Read this story for Grade 2 learners with an illustrative and literary style and they’ll easily understand why he is so often mentioned in literature. Einstein The face of Albert Einstein is being used to advertise products with intellectual connotations. His face is also recognizable because it has a very recognizable face, but what people don’t know is that Albert Einstein wasn’t really an inventor, that he didn’t spend much of his time with astronomy or physics, and that he didn’t know how the world worked. In 1905 he published a paper explaining the theory of relativity and his discovery was hugely influential in the fields of physics and mathematics. He used his theory to develop the first computer and helped many people to understand the workings of computers. In 1912 he published a theory of electromagnetism. He used an electric charge to change the state of the atom in what he called a resonant electron. This was the first scientific discovery to be independently confirmed and set the foundation for many of the scientific theories. He was born on April 24, 1879 in what was then Silesia, Italy. His parents were from Italy and Germany. His father and grandfather came to Italy from England. He was born and raised in Italy. Albert Einstein was born in 1879. He died in 1955.","Albert Einstein - a man of science. One man with a unique personality. Known for his research, his personality and his work. I spotted this photo in the front page of a German magazine this week. Einstein: Einfuerchte Inventor Einstein, a famous Austrian mathematician, has a new face on the cover of a German magazine, a new photograph of him. Previously, his face had appeared on a variety of products in an intellectual connotation and I wondered how he could possibly have felt about that. “You can never know about anybody’s personality completely. You never know what they are going through. They may be a little sad,” he said. Einstein: Einfuerchte Inventor Einstein, a famous Austrian mathematician, has a new face on the cover of a German magazine.","Albert Einstein The name Albert Einstein is a classic for many young people. You see his face and name in adverts for computers, encyclopaedias, calculators, and other products with intellectual connotations. You may even have seen his face on a stamp. Einstein is well known for doing groundbreaking research that changed the world in a profound way. He was born at a time when the world was struggling to comprehend natural laws that were changing everyday. He used to be told that his theories would be unfeasible as they were hard to understand, but that was before computers. People were now more understanding and so his discoveries became more important than ever. Today, people still study his theories to better understand how the world works. This lesson is not very hard, but if you are having trouble reading it, I suggest that you skip it.","Albert Einstein is a favourite of most people because he is an iconic figure, a symbol of genius, and for a long time now has been used as an advertising symbol for a range of products with intellectual connotations. However, in recent times, Einstein’s image has become an easy target for marketers. In 2007, a video ad of Einstein promoting an iPad was created and used to attract a large number of viewers. As the video was shown, some YouTubers have attempted to discredit the advertisement. As a result, the video has since been taken down. However, the video may still be up there on youtube. This may be because it was made in a language that is more familiar to the audience than English. The YouTubers are attempting to sell the iPad by using a number of slogans and copyright claims to ensure the video's validity. The YouTubers were successful, and over 600,000 subscribers have seen the video on YouTube. The video itself has been watched over 200 million times."
C2,"There are many reasons why amateur astronomy is growing steadily in popularity. For one thing, the discovery of a new star has enabled many of the world's finest astronomers to see their favourite stars, such as the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes. These telescopes have made astronomy accessible to everyone, with the aid of computer-guided software that allows them to see stars by their own light. Other changes include the introduction of high power and smaller telescopes, a reduction in the cost of equipment, and the introduction of easy-to-use diagrams of the sky. One of the major changes is that all of these features allow amateurs to observe more celestial objects than ever before. One of the most important and most useful features, however, is the ability for people to see the stars for themselves, a feature that is often neglected by professional astronomers. The telescopes available today, however, are still not up to the same standards as those used by professional astronomers. They still require some serious observing, and often require special software to guide the observer through a sequence of stages designed to guide the person toward observing a specific target, such as a distant star. Fortunately, there are now also computers available that can automatically take care of these things. For the most part, amateur astronomers do not need the level of experience required for professional astronomers, although they need to know what to do. The field has seen some significant changes, including the emergence of the digital age. Many of today’s modern astronomers use computerised software that allows them to follow the stars by using a computer. This makes the field less cluttered and more enjoyable, and amateur astronomers can use it to focus their telescopes through a computer rather than a telescope, reducing the need for a professional astronomer. The advancements in the science and technology make it possible to take astronomy to a whole new level.",Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need.,"There are more amateur astronomers in the UK now than there have been in the last few decades, and the range of equipment is almost too extensive to list. As a result of these changes, the number of people taking up amateur astronomy is expected to grow by about 5% in the coming years, reaching approximately 1m by 2020. Astronomy has not only changed its appearance, but also its accessibility to a wider audience. More people now own telescopes and equipment ranging in size from a small telescope to a huge and powerful telescope capable of capturing the whole sky. Astronomy has also changed, in the sense that amateur astronomers are encouraged to pursue their interest and become knowledgeable about the world around them.",Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century.

Art is praised in terms of being unique revolutionary shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago.,"I like to think of art as an escape from the monotony of reality. I like to picture myself surrounded by endless blue skies, the smell of freshly baked bread, and the light streaming in through trees. And then I'm happy to do nothing but work on the petty things that make me smile. It's what's in the background that I'm grateful for. As I write this I am listening to a radio program, and I hear the newscaster say, ""What about all the people who don't like to work in the studio and keep the dust under their fingernails?"" That's when I know that I've found what it takes to paint what I love. Art, though, is a lot of hard work. It takes dedication, a lot of patience, and a lot of perseverance. It is, after all, painting. To me, the greatest thing about art is that it is never easy, nor does it always seem to be in the right place. And I don't see myself pursuing art as a career, or becoming an artist - that is, doing anything else at all. I am going to paint whatever I feel moved to paint.",In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries.

Then one day I went into an art store and saw some old oil paintings. They looked like nothing I had ever seen before, but I remembered the name of the artist who had painted them and I had never seen them before. They were very strange paintings with no obvious meaning. I took a close look at one of them, and it reminded me of the picture of Christ in the tabernacle made by the prophet Elijah when he told the Israelites that God was not of this world. I thought about it for a moment, and I realized I had once seen another painting of Christ that matched this one in terms of both time and symbolism. When he died on March 31, 1973, his painting was the third oldest work of art in the world after the Ark of the Covenant, and the Bible. It had been a century since the first painting of Christ had been created. This painting is perhaps one of the first known images of Jesus and I find this painting extremely moving. It is a picture of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on a cross. We look at it and remember how this painting represents the suffering of Christ. It is an image that is able to capture the emptiness of the human soul when faced with overwhelming evil. To make us understand how terrible this world is, we have to look at the cross and remember how precious it is.

C2,"It is hard to tell whether this was a wish for self-adornment or if it was merely an inclination to make something look better. Either way, the stone age people found ways to express their emotions by making metal objects for themselves and the rest, as they say, is history. Although the most interesting aspects of the early metals are the traces of molten lead, tin, and other metals that can still be found today, these elements were not the main subject of early metalworking. The actual discovery of metals in stone tools as we know them today dates back to the mid-nineteenth century, and is just one more piece of evidence for the gradual evolution of society and technology that has gone into making things out of stone. In addition, as you can see, most early metals were the result of accidents, or were used accidentally. This is another example of the evolution of the metals that have come to be used in tools.","It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment, one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. Metals They are now found in our jewellery, in our watches and on many things we can buy in shops.","Metals were first known to the Stone Age man around 2.5 million years ago in Ireland, where they were used to make tools and jewelry. We know that the stone age people of Ireland used tin as a tin-copper alloy in the bronze age, and bronze in the iron age. The Stone Age men were so impressed with the metals they were using that they began trading them among themselves. They made their own metal tools by casting, but soon learned that the metals were easily worked by any skilled metal worker. In the Iron Age men started using copper and iron, and by the time the second half of the Iron Age man were working with metals they started using other metals also.","The early ancestors of modern humans aren’t even very old, so they’ve been using metals for a long time. Iron was used to create tools and weapons, stone tools for stone tool, and metal tools for metal tool. During the Stone Age they used tools made from stone, wood, or bone.","A2 learners should utilise figurative language like a dictionary and adverbs to make the story more interesting.

The name Copper was coined by the French engineer Louis Poirier in 1775. When he sat analyzing what kind of metal this shiny copper was, he noticed that it weighed. Apparently, Copper was one of the first metals to come into existence. For several centuries, it was used as currency. Today, the Copper is still mined in most of the world, from the United States to South America. The Metals are most commonly used as ornaments, though. They are widely used in jewelry and as the basis of precious metals."
C2,"I remember the last time I was in Vienna and one of the first things I noticed was the light. It was soft and romantic, but also unfathomably beautiful. My eyes lit up when I first glimpsed this building. This was a small apartment building, but it’s size made it seem like a home. A building this big would probably have been used as a barracks or for storage, and maybe even a hotel. The street in front of it was a pedestrian-only zone, and it was very busy. The light spilled into the building from the courtyard across the street, which had become a haven for locals, tourists, and those just passing through. There was also the “Wet Spital,” a rumored squat bar, built inside a former synagogue. This was where the infamous St Paul’s gallows were carved out of marble in the 16th century. The gallows were also rumored to be the site of a massacre. There are rumor accounts of a massacre in Vienna. It all had a lot to do with the city of Vienna’s long-running involvement with the Second World War. In 1944, a large group of people had marched into the city centre to protect the American soldiers. This would end up being the worst war of the 20th century, and many of the innocent victims of the bloodshed were tortured, executed, or otherwise hurt. It was a great day in the history of the city, and one that would have made many in my generation proud. The sight of a memorial to the American soldiers surrounded by American flags in the background made me a little sad. The people of Vienna were very friendly, and I made quite a few friends during my time there. My friend was an American military officer and I made some friends on my tour. He was from Virginia, and he had a lot to say about the soldiers in his country. He knew how to speak English, and he was very good at what he did. I made a lot of friends when I was there. He was interested in a lot of things, including photography and photography-related matters, and he was very proud of his country. He had a lot of people to thank for that. He had been in the army, and he had had many experiences and knowledge. He was interested in learning how the war affected different cultures, and his thoughts tended towards the Allied soldiers. There was something about the soldiers that stuck with me. I knew they were a special people, even though I never really knew them. I also knew they were the same people I had grown up around. At the time, they were the best of friends. They were very proud of their country. He wasn’t just a man, he was a citizen of this country, and his life had a direct impact on the citizens of that country. This was an assignment that took me two days to complete, and it was very exciting. But there were moments of frustration and frustration that could only be summed up in one word - exhaustion. I just wanted to get back to my apartment and get some sleep. To get back to my family. Despite the fact that my flight had been delayed a day, I decided to go for it. I flew to Vienna, Austria, where I rented a flat. The first day in Vienna, I was greeted by the locals in the hotel lobby. They seemed so pleased to have a visitor like me. My first impression was of this being a very expensive hotel. This was also true of the coffee shop in front of it – the one that looked out onto the street. I’ve been to some pretty expensive hotels over my lifetime, but I was not prepared for the price tag at the time. It was also the first time I walked away from the hotel room and into the cold and unforgiving streets. Luckily, I had a very good friend who was a photographer. He had taken many great photographs over the years, including this one. After getting settled in my hotel room, it was finally time to head out into town to take my photos. I made my way to the front of the building where the fountain was located. It was quite a climb, but it was well worth it. As you may be able to tell from my writing, it was a very nice hotel. The only negative that I can find is that the front desk clerk was very unfriendly to tourists, though not as much as the one in the restaurant. Nonetheless, I did","Vienna was the perfect place for me to shoot photographs. It was filled with museums and art galleries and cafes, and I was in the city during the height of the Third Reich, so the buildings had a special atmosphere. The only thing that did not seem right about it was that I would be photographing people. I hated photographing people. I hated how a snobbish and prejudiced crowd would sit in the cafes and stare at me. However, I was always careful when spotting people in these places. I was not afraid to take photographs of a group of people without their consent. The Vienna assignment could not have been more challenging. I had to capture the essence of the city. At the end of the assignment, I had to publish an album of my photos from the assignment, but it was not easy as it consisted of photographs of many people, rather than only myself. At some point during the process, I had to edit those photos. I had to make them presentable. At the end of the project I had to take away what I had photographed, for they were more important than the things they represented. But I was more than ready for the challenge.","A few months back, I started my first ever job as a photographer in Vienna. Like most photographers, I had worked for myself, but this was my first time managing a team of people. After years of working as an independent photographer, I had started to get some regular clients from Austria. There was one specific client in Vienna. A photographer who had a unique way of seeing things. He would be the subject of a photograph and he would then have two weeks to return the pictures to me, using a special cleaning technique, and then I would get one final copy. He needed a great deal of work for a big book of pictures, so the work had to be finished in three weeks. I arranged it so that it would be difficult to sell the photos so I would not get hung up about the money. He told me he would do it for free. I knew exactly what I was getting into. It was much harder than I expected because he asked me to show him what I had done to his photos. He was able to put them on a computer in order to show them to me. I told him what I had done, and then I handed him the computer so he could get back to his work. I was pleased with what I had achieved. I had the satisfaction of knowing I was doing my job right.","A few days ago I was sitting in a coffee shop in Vienna with my friend Freddie. Freddie asked me to take pictures of the spires of the Vienna Cathedral. I immediately said yes. The cathedral itself is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I loved the colors, the architecture, the architecture. It was like something I had just walked past in a dream. At one point I turned around to go back to the coffee shop, but the gentleman stopped me. ""Where did you get that?"" he asked. ""Well, you must have looked at that one,"" I said. ""What did you see?"" I smiled and replied ""I saw the bells."" His face lit up. ""How do you know where they are?"" He said, ""They are on a hill."" It was a steep hill. I thought he meant a mountain. I smiled and walked up to it. It was a simple hill, but the view out my window was magnificent. I could see the Austrian mountains in the distance. I felt like I had been transported in time. I thought about that for a few seconds then, and I said. ""No, no, I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I didn't get to take some pictures. The city of Vienna is just too beautiful to be photographed."" I told Freddie, ""No,"" and he started laughing. ""You made me laugh, didn't you?"" He replied in a flat voice, ""No. I can't remember."" I tried to laugh back and said, ""No, I'm really sorry. I just felt a little bit sick. I need to eat some food."" He said, ""I do believe you."" I felt really sorry, but, as I knew I would, I said, ""Do you mean I could write you a letter?"" Freddie laughed again and said, ""I have no intention of pursuing it."" Then, he started laughing again, ""I love you, Freddie.""","I was sitting on a bench in the hut outside the cafe. It was sunny and warm and there were hundreds of tourists walking by. I was taken aback by their presence. I wasn’t a tourist. My grandfather was. I hadn’t done any traveling before, but I guess I would be a tourist when I lived in London. I had come to the UK to see my family. I loved living there. But it was only because my grandfather had lived there and loved it. There were lots of tourists. They were just walking along a street, enjoying the sunshine. I could have sat in that hut all day, if I wanted to. The light had made the trees bright. But people were too busy chatting to let that happen. I was on my own. Not only did I have to take photographs, I also had to get dressed, get ready, find a nice place to eat dinner, pack, and get ready to leave. It was a different experience than what I was used to. After that first morning in Vienna, I was not the same person I was the day before. I had not had a good sleep for days, so I woke up early and went for a walk. As I was walking along the path, one of the trees started to bend. As I looked up, I saw a pillar which seemed to have fallen in front of me. As I looked closer, I noticed a branch strewn over it. I moved away from it so it didn’t come towards me. As I walked down the street, I could see that I could have easily seen it from afar. When I looked back, it looked as if it was still there. I looked down and saw that it was actually part of the pillar. It fell off. When I went back to the side of it, I realized that I had seen the pillar before. I stood there in stunned silence for a couple of minutes. I could almost feel the tension in the air. How could people live like this? How could they possibly have such a hatred for things that can harm their health? All I could think of was how it must have felt to be that one woman in the street that night, struggling with her decision to stand up and not let her daughter walk alone. I wondered what I had seen, when I saw that it had fallen, what that tree looked like in the back, what a sight it would have been to see that. Then I realized that if I had let my daughter go to the park, she would have felt the same. I didn’t want that to happen to her. I hated losing my daughter, I wanted to protect her from all that pain. I could have rushed out to Vienna and tried to save her, but in the end, I had to stay silent and wait for my husband to return from his work. I didn’t even want to leave. And that was the real tragedy. As I left, I turned around and headed for the cafe. I was about to walk home when my grandfather pulled out a black envelope from one of the tables. It contained something he had brought to Vienna to give to my mother as a Christmas present. My grandfather had been murdered. That was why we had left it there. I think he was trying to protect his family from what happened to his grandfather. That meant he had to protect the family from a killer who wanted to take them out. I couldn’t allow that. I made a few photographs with that light and the shadows on the trees in front of me. I thought I was done. The lights were off. I was thinking of going to the toilet but my grandfather had told me not to. It wasn’t about my money. My mother did not want to spend money on the gift for me, she wanted to make memories with me that she could look back on, but she wouldn’t. She would have liked a gift of photos that would last forever. She was a great photographer, not just with beautiful light and scenery, but also with interesting people and stories to tell. One day she would be coming to live with me, and we would be together. She had to make sure that our families would always be together, if not when she was gone. I would never be able to go to Vienna on my own again, but I never had that thought of going back to visit her. I had my camera ready but there was nobody on the street when I got back to the hotel. I went up to the hut and took a picture of the pillar that had fallen off, and then I turned around and saw the whole of the city covered in the light. It",I walked through Vienna and its wonderful architecture. I walked along the street and captured the symmetry and beauty of the buildings. There was nothing but history and culture. At night the city was lit up. It was night in Vienna and the city was lit up too. I was surprised and touched by the incredible lights. I was touched at how the light changed colors by the seasons. The buildings were lit with so many different colors. I felt the history and culture of the city. I was excited by the history I captured. The city had a very different history than the American version. I was inspired by the rich history of the American side of the city. I was inspired by the history and architecture of the European side of the city.,"When I arrived at the airport, I paused to look at the weather, thinking about my camera. There were few of them in a suitcase next to me. I had to ask my mother to open the suitcase before I left. I also thought about the photographs I had taken on previous trips. I found a few interesting images from the Vienna assignment. The sun was shining brightly in the city. The buildings were lit by golden light."
C2,"In many other places sleep is now widely acknowledged as the luxury of the upper classes. The rich and the powerful are more inclined to sleep than the less privileged and the young. It's like a lot of things that people value over time, time being a commodity that can be bought and sold at a profit. So it is with people now as in some parts of the world many people now live with a chronic insomnia. I don't think it is an issue just in the affluent. There have been studies showing that the rich and the powerful do not always sleep well. We've all heard stories of wealthy and famous people who just won't sleep. We've also read accounts of celebrities who reportedly won't get up to use the toilet. And in recent years there has been a growing trend of wealthy people being too sedentary to do all that they used to do, such as watching their weight with a watch. In the modern world too many are too busy to take time for themselves. The privileged have long enjoyed the luxury of being able to sleep all night, avoiding being awake to the pain of it and so have been able to wake up feeling tired, unable to concentrate and unable to function. So why is there a demand in society for a better quality of life than that offered by a good night's sleep? How can we provide a better life for everyone, when in the end the only solution is to improve their sleep? What would happen if we could take out a bit of the stress and strain that so many people experience each day when they can't sleep? When I was younger we often lived up on a farm or in our car. We stayed up all night, we drove, we did the chores we knew how to do and when we got home we would sit and write letters to those we loved. And it wasn't just to eat. It was something we did because it was the right thing to do. It was a family, we had our ups and downs and we slept like children. It was a lifestyle. It wasn't hard but it wasn't easy either. The house was cold but we always had enough hot water, and we were always free to go off and play, we had the opportunity to talk to people in a way that they hadn't been able to do before. As time went on, we would get caught up in the excitement of the moment without ever really being able to relax and enjoy ourselves. We would have to plan for this and it wouldn't be much fun. But we didn't have the same worries about getting good sleep. I used to write a lot but I lost the habit. I wasn't very good at it. I didn't like it when I was younger and the thought of that never occurred to me. But I could remember what it was like to sleep. I always felt insecure when I wasn't sleeping because my wife and I would spend so much time together. I would talk to her through the night and we would talk about the day. And so I rediscovered writing and it has remained one of the things I do as a means of escape. What's it like to write when you have a whole raft of things in the back of your mind? What would the writing do when you were unable to sleep?","On their way to school on a hot and sunny Tuesday morning, David and his class met a young couple on the road who had recently been spotted by a police officer. They took the opportunity to 'talk shop', discussing how to have the ideal day. In particular, they discussed how he had to have enough sleep. When David answered, the policeman replied with a warning. They looked at each other for a moment, and then David's classmate turned around and started to follow David into the kitchen. David looked at the three of them for a moment before answering. ""Well, what do you want me to say? Are you in here to talk to us? No, I'm here to talk to you.""","Is a lack of sleep the new problem? If we take a wider perspective, is this a problem that can be addressed? And if so, what can be done to help people suffering from sleeplessness? I spent a couple of days in a sleep research lab, where the team set out to study the causes of sleeplessness. One particular theory is that we have become too reliant on electronic devices and gadgets, especially televisions. Television screens can narrate what’s going on in a person’s head, interrupting his or her sleep, so that, the researchers explained, one might learn to feel better after watching it. We can also reduce anxiety by learning a relaxation technique, which can be practised, in one way or another, at home or even in the workplace. I’d never tried a relaxation technique myself, but I’d heard that a person with a mild case of depression could benefit by sleeping in a separate room and concentrating solely on their breathing instead of watching TV, and that hypnosis can help. I’d been to an insomniac research lab before, and after listening to the noise, felt my heart racing. Although I could fall asleep after hypnosis, it couldn’t last for more than 30 minutes at a time. Even hypnosis, even in a short period of time, lasted about three minutes at a time. This time my heart stopped, and I realized I was not a fan of hypnosis. That’s when the real work started. I had my first session with one of the lab staff, and soon realised this might be my solution. The session began with relaxation techniques to help me calm down, and I could begin the process of deep breathing. I was amazed by how effective it was. Not only did it calm down my anxious mind, but I felt able to sleep again. So that night I was really feeling better. I started the week off with lots of breathing exercises, and it helped with my anxiety, and my concentration for work. After a few days, I noticed that I was sleeping more and less, and the first day of my new job was a total success.","Enough Sleep? Tiredness it is often claimed has become the modern condition.

C2,"The temperature is cool to the touch in the fitness centre, but not in the sweltering corridors in the office blocks behind Cannons Gym where most lunchtime workouts take place. For most workers, it’s their sanctuary for a few hours during the day. Now, if it has anything to do with the unusually warm summer, then you’d have to re-evaluate your daily workout. “You don’t need to do the whole day, do you?” asks Jeremy. “So what’s the point of hitting the gym at all if it’s a little too cold at lunchtime?” “Oh, and you can’t work out in the office where it’s always really hot. I think I’ll try Cannons Gym at night instead. I’m not going to pay the extra for a few extra hours in the hot sun anyway.” “You’ve got to go. My colleagues are all at work so I don’t have time for a workout!” says Andy. “So what if you’ve been going to the gym all day? But I’m not going to get the exercise I need this month to feel good about myself,” says Jeremy. “So, do I have to give up the lunchtime workout?” says Joe. “It would be impossible. All the other workers come for the gym and then they go home. So why can’t I just go to the gym at lunchtime and workout instead?”","The gym's air conditioning has gone overboard, leaving the place cold, grey and sterile.

A group of teenagers stood up and started to shout back. “Call the police,” Benny shouted back. The children screamed out in excitement and Benny took the opportunity to explain to his friend the significance of the incident.","A group of young people were chatting in a quiet section of the gym when one of them said, ‘Hey, that’s cold.’ They all laughed at that.",It’s a popular lunch-time haunt for City of London workers.

C2,"You were terrified. There was no light to see the stars; the sky had been covered in a thick cloud of mist. I was scared so much that I tried to take a quick look at the well to see if the light was actually coming from inside. I saw a flash, and gasped, but then saw the light, but that was not the light from the stars. My breath caught, and suddenly I was on the surface. I turned my head to see the well head bob up and down in the wind. I looked at my right arm, but my hands were too wet. My right foot was still in the bucket. After a moment my left hand came loose with a sore. With a heavy thud I looked to the bucket to find you there. You looked back at me and laughed. I felt the same way. In fact my whole body felt cold and uncomfortable. I sighed, and then laughed more. The sound was like a blast of wind from an aircraft, and it made me shiver, but I was just glad that we had made it safely to the surface. With an ill-wonderland bang I slid down the wall, into the deep, black hole. I reached for you to be close. You shook me gently by the hand, I knew you would not let me go. I stood, and stared at the sky, staring back up at you until the whirlpools filled the well, and poured out all the water. I saw that the well head bobted and spun and then stopped again. The whirlpools seemed to stop, then stop again, and then stop again, until the water in the well ended. The water in the well was so cold that I could not feel my hand on it, but I waited a moment, just for the water to disappear. When the water was gone I felt strange, like the water had been dragged back up into the wall by the wind. I tried to breathe out, but couldnt. My chest felt heaving, my lungs gasping as if I had just climbed out of the well. It wasnt that bad, at least not for me. I thought to myself; the water at the bottom of that well must have been cold to make the water look that cold. I was very glad that we had escaped the well, and that I could look back down at you and see the stars. We both thought about that longingly for a long time, and then when we realised that we had survived this experience we both said to one another, ""That was worth it.""","I sat in the bucket on the surface, holding the bucket in one hand and the stick in the other, until it felt too heavy to bear. When the hand holding the stick reached the bottom, I realised that the stone ringed around the hole was missing. When I jumped out of the hole, you came and stood at the gate, clutching a handful of stones. We waited for a while for the well pump to fill, then jumped out and found the hole was empty. The well was at the end of a well track. There was a hole about ten feet deep on the top of a hill, but the hole was filled with dirt and debris, so I climbed out. I picked up the stone that had been left behind by the hand who had climbed into the well. I gathered it around my feet, then gently threw the stone back into the hole.","The moon was brilliant red and stood proud and firm in the sky. I jumped out of the hole and hurried to meet my friend who was waiting on the other side. He had just put his shirt on so that he would not get wet. We hurried to meet him. There he was, wearing a thick white jumper and a red hat, with a very large red bow tie. He was smiling broadly and we spoke of the stars. I gave him a hug and hoped that he liked it.","The well had a concrete floor so we didn't risk getting trapped. We were in, however, when the well started to fill with water. As we headed back up the hill we decided that we should go back, but that didn't take long. We sat by the well and looked at the stars.","I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day was clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched eyes wide fist in mouth as I winched up the well bucket steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I had also told you that if you stuck your hand out the side of the well I would come back and pull you down. ""It ain't workin', kid"", I said sadly. ""That's not how I know I'm in the clear."" ""Oh, so you've been trying to get away with this since last night?"" ""I lied,"" I said. ""Did you want to get away?"" ""I don't know, it's only the way out,"" you said. ""You lied?"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""It was only the way out."" ""But then why didn't you tell me?"" ""Why did you let them in when we've had the whole place locked up?"" ""Oh,"" I said, ""well, it was a bit cold; we wouldn't want to disturb the peace of that well, anyway."" ""The well is deep,"" you said. ""It's a very deep well."" ""You're right, it's actually quite deep,"" I said firmly. ""I'm not sure why you didn't tell me."" ""Well, I'm sorry, I wanted you to see the stars."" ""What's wrong with you?"" ""Well, I can't see the stars; that's not what I was hoping for."" ""Although they didn't look quite so clear as the evening before,"" I said. ""But there was a man's house at the top of the well, and I bet it was dark enough to see the stars from there. I haven't been able to see the stars from the well, though."" ""But we're not going in,"" I said. ""Why did you make your friend come in?"" ""Well, that's why they locked us in; because it ain't so deep, either."" ""They lock us in!"" ""All right then. What did you say? I said I'm going in."" ""You could only see the stars if it was very clear. So that is not a good idea."" ""And as for you, I'd bet you had an important meeting to attend somewhere, just in case,"" I said firmly. ""We could always go to the pub later."" ""I think that's a good idea,"" I said. ""There are a lot of stars in there. When I look through the hole, it's only a small part of the sky. But you couldn't see a lot of them."" ""What is that?"" asked the woman behind the counter. ""Well I don't know either, but I think they're some of the smallest, and the biggest stars. I'm going to check next time."" ""No I think so. You probably didn't tell me that because I kept on telling you that they were very small. But you would've just missed that one."" ""Did you get all the way out?"" ""Yes, you did. You would've known."" ""Oh well, what's that going to do?"" she snorted at me. ""We're gonna end up in here instead!""",The well was a good place to look at the stars.,THE WELL I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole one could see the stars if the day was clear.

C2,"The hall was empty, except for one lamp flickering on the wall. A few candles tucked into a small wooden box gleamed from the wall and there was no movement in the hall. Ralph was beginning to think that some sort of ghost might be about to awaken. He had to find a way to answer the door without waking the sleepy dead thing. He paused and thought long and hard. He hadn't noticed that this one was out during the day, and there were no lights to confuse him. And then, as he thought about it, something changed. It wasn't the ghost of the dead, for sure, not even a shadow of it. It was someone who sat in the living room late at night, watching the world. And it wasn't a ghost. It was just a young man who was lying on his bed.",Ralph entered the dark motionless hall. On the far wall was a mirror. Behind it stood a lamp. In a shadow in the far corner of the hall was a light switch. It was a bulb. In the living room on the other side was a bed. Ralph realised that the bed wasn’t empty. Probably it had been taken up by someone or something the night before. On closer examination he realised that there was nothing at all on the bed. He went to the next room and found that the bed was empty too. That made him even more sure of it being a ghost.,"Ralph was walking out of the kennel to his car, when he saw a large fox leap out of the enclosure. ""That's my dog,"" he said. ""Shut up!"" Ralph shouted, and the fox bolted into the house. He grabbed Ralph by the collar and kicked him in the ribs. ""If I hadn't been so stupid, I would have run into the nearest house and tripped and fell right back into the kennel!""","Ralph smiled. ""Don't worry, it's still mine, it just needs a coat.""","I walked down the hall towards my room, Ralph started crying and stammered that he was going to call someone. He knew I am not going to call anybody at all, it's my room. Its a relief. So many people seem to give up on me at some point in my life. I walked the corridor between rooms, wallowing with sadness in the silence. Then one day he told me that his son had been harmed in the war and he had lost all contact with his friends. I thought that if that was the case they would blame him but, no, I didn't get a response. I was the only person who had a contact with him over the time and, even after three years, the qualm that I get whenever I return alone still besieges me. I couldn't believe it. I didn't even think about it for a while then I got to the end of the corridor and realized that my own'single man' guilt would be too much of a burden for me. I looked at the mirror, it was empty, but not empty enough to warrant making a statement about myself. I opened the door and saw a child running towards me in the hallway. I was a little terrified. My eyes were glued to the dark hall. But as I looked up at him I noticed he looked like a very happy boy, smiling and all. I decided it was safe to let him back into my flat for the night. I locked the door behind me and walked out. As I walked down the hall I saw a woman jogging towards me. I wondered what kind of a mood she had in her house. She must be tired because her dog was barking. Then I noticed she was standing by the front door and asked her if she had seen anyone. Then I opened the door to let her back in. She walked up to the front door and I saw her, she was standing there watching me as I opened the door. I was shocked and I ran down the hall towards the kitchen. I just ran past the kitchen door and into the kitchen and I saw my neighbor. She was chatting quietly as I walked past her. She looked very happy and cheerful, I was expecting her to be indignant when I told her that I had left the door open but instead she smiled when I told her that I had returned. We both agreed that I was pretty happy with how I was feeling at that point. At that moment I thought that I might be very sad but I knew I had to go on with my day. I had to get back to work. I thought to myself as I walked up to my room and saw the boy in the hall. She was a little upset but I assured her that I would have a normal day and that this is just normal behavior. I ran out of the kitchen and stopped at the door where the dog had been sat. My wife sat on my left side while I stood on my right side, just watching him. I looked over and saw my dog, I thought she had some kind of allergies and she really needed a bed. I quickly climbed over my bed and ran out. The man in the hall was not looking at me but was looking up at me. It was as though he was preparing to attack me and I was not letting him in to get away. My heart sank as I saw my neighbor run down the hall and his dog follow behind. It's been years since I last saw her. I was very sad. I had a good day, I wasn't sad to see her, but I don't think I could walk around her and take care of the dog the way I was supposed to be able to. I think my dog had a better attitude than I could have handled the situation and I think she would have been happier to see me than having me. I really didn't want to be here anymore. I did not want to go home. I had some friends in my life, I don't want to leave. I feel like I really need to keep it together, not just for myself but for everyone else, even if I don't necessarily have my own friends. I really just need to keep my friends from leaving. And in the morning I got the call and the policeman said that they had arrived. As I stood there with my dog I was relieved to be free. I felt a warmth in my heart that I hadn't been able to express all day long.

C2,"Heritage can make us feel an emotional connection to our past. Even in a distant past we can feel a connection to something we have no personal experience with. For example a stone in a church tower might look just like a modern brick tower, but a thousand years ago, that was how it used to look. We can also feel an attachment to things that are not ours. The British Empire and the history of our continent are all about our own heritage. Our collective past helps to shape who we are. It is how we have learned to live and survive. Our collective past helps to shape who we are. It is why we have the world’s largest museum; it is why we have countless ancient cities and forts, castles, temples, fortresses and burial mounds. It is also why we have national parks, museums and libraries. Heritage gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection to the past. It allows us to see that the past is a time and place of discovery, of adventure, of discovery, and it can give us a sense of belonging. Heritage can give us an immediate sense of connection to who we are but it can also make us feel a connection to a place that we no longer see. Having a rich and diverse heritage can also help us to understand a place in a way that we might otherwise be unable to. When we look at our ancestors’ lives we see their pain, their struggles, their pride and their hopes. That is why we celebrate our heritage – not only our own but the heritage of others. But when we look into the past, we find ourselves in communities with long histories. Many places we live and work in today have had some kind of historical significance or heritage. In the UK, the city of Sheffield is the oldest city in England and is well known for its cathedral. Its history dates back to the beginning of the 20th century when an important railway line was built across the city. Our heritage – from our ancestors and the cities that grew around them – shapes who we are today. When we look at our ancestors’ lives we can see many parallels between our present and our past. We can even say that we are a part of our past. At home, we will often tell stories about our ancestors. They will tell us stories that relate to the past. So we look at these stories and try to understand how it can benefit us in todays world. And yet there are so many people today who do not have that same opportunity. This is because we have lost our ability to connect with our past. We are able to look back on our pasts, but we have lost our ability to connect with those who lived before us. We do not have the knowledge or skills that we used when we were young. For example, our grandfather John is not the same as his grandfather – our grandparents were not the same at all. John John is not even the same as the grandfather he is today. In the midst of all the stories, there was another person who had a very different story to tell. John John was a farmer from Scotland and he was on the cusp of having a great life. He had lost all of his family and his home. A very tough life. But he reconnected with others, he found a passion that he had never had before. He travelled to the Highlands to pick berries and pick grapes. And he grew vegetables. A couple of days later he got a call from the landlady of the Glenlivet estate telling him about her great grandfather. She was not in great health but she had an exciting history. And she was sure that John would be back. John was not only his grandfather. John had a grandfather who lived 100 years ago, a grandfather whose wife had just died. The couple became the first family to have a grandfather and both were awarded the title of “great grandfather”. But it was not just John’s grandfather that had a great life. There were many other family members that had a great life too. John could tell us stories of how their family lived and when he died they would be remembered. Is your family connected to the past?

The only way I could really understand how it works is to take a look at some of the examples of people's heritage, and to ask myself: who is connected to this heritage? Who could it be? What happens when one group scoffs or ignores this heritage? Do others find it offensive, or maybe it's important? Maybe I'm not that different. So, there I was, taking a look at a website. I read a few entries. The first entry was about a boy named Thomas who was a farmer. Then I read a few entries about how people would say a certain way about a specific place or a particular person. I liked Thomas and he seemed to have lots of things in common with my grandfather, so I clicked the link and took a look. I saw the site was all about his heritage. I clicked the link and read the first entry. It was about a man named William. It's like a family tree. He could be related to everyone in the family and he had all sorts of things connected to his father, from his mother to his uncles to his grandparents. Maybe that is why I felt so connected to him and his family.","The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously we feel connected to our personal heritage usually we know who and what our grandparents were and we will have heard stories about how they lived. The people in my community are proud of their heritage as it gives them a genuine sense of connection with the past. There are lots of interesting places and things to see around my local area and the people in my community are always telling stories about what’s on their doorstep. A few weeks ago I went to an exhibition in a local arts centre and a great exhibit was on the history of the town. There were a series of exhibits and it was fascinating looking back on the history of the town. There were stories about how things have changed over the years and how the community has come to be the place it is today. A lot of people are trying to save their local heritage and the place that their grandparents built. This has meant that the whole town is now looking for ways to save it. This could involve the people who live in the town looking at their own buildings to see if they can find any ways to preserve them and build new ones as well. This would give the town a sense of pride which would attract people to the area. This is a really interesting subject, the topic looks fascinating.","The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past.

C2,"“Othello,” at the Royal Court Theatre, is one of the best Shakespeare productions ever staged. Until now. Last Spring, the cast had to work hard to make a case for why Fearon’s performance was ‘less than’ the other characters. Here, it all looks different, and it is. The young actor is superb as Othello, but his portrayal is enhanced by the excellent direction of the company and by the outstanding acting of his co-stars Simon Russell Beale and Simon Russell Beale. The omission of a young actor from the stage version was not entirely intentional, though. The production had been given a makeover and with the right casting, it could have been a spectacular success in London. But the success did not allow for such a move and the show has now been called off. The problem was that a new star had to be found, and he was no longer at the stage school with whom I had worked in the spring. That meant the best omens remained with tenacious playwright Stephen Daldry, the Director of Stratford. Daldry and director Jon Slater had cast the young Fearon in the title role – he is now 40 – when the show opened at Stratford and did an excellent job in bringing the production to London. A change of scenery, a new cast and a new director has allowed the production to make the leap from London to Stratford and it is an amazing achievement. The cast of this great production is complemented by a fantastic ensemble cast, particularly Simon Russell Beale and James Ward and it is these two actors who drive the show, and their performances are so good that I have now decided to change my review. But it is far from easy to change a review. This is why I am rewriting my review.","When the production of Shakespeare’s Othello travelled to London last summer from Stratford-upon-Avon and was brought here for the first time last week, I promised myself that if it had opened in spring, I would have liked to be able to see the show again to give myself a better view of the drama than I gave last spring. I was wrong, however, because the cast was of an exceptionally high standard and, as the show has now been told by the audience at the Royal Opera House, it is not over until Othello ends. Having a good night out at the Royal Opera House was only part of my plans. I want to see what else is there to enjoy when the production comes to London at the end of October. If only I could return to Stratford for the last two weeks of the run.","On Monday night, the London production of Shakespeare’s play Othello (directed by Jeremy Irons) arrived for its world premiere in the RSC’s Sadler’s Wells Theatre. I had the pleasure of watching the performance in the company of a host of talented actors including Ray Fearon as Othello. We first met at the bar of the venue where the show was being performed, and we discussed the play’s significance and history before heading to the balcony to catch a glimpse of Othello’s ship and to take pictures. Othello is an unjustly maligned character, but Fearon has nailed the performance. His performance is filled with vigour and conviction and his subtle handling of the character of a ruthless aristocrat is convincing. The other actors make equally strong contributions, but Fearon’s performance is the stand-out. He has a natural ability to carry off an intensely complex character, and the audience is enraptured when he portrays the character’s rage. I found it difficult to focus on the plot and the moral implications of the play, so I took breaks in between to catch up on my social media reading. It’s a shame I wasn’t there to take pictures but I can’t help wonder if fearing Fearon could have played a more mature version of the role?","Now Othello has made its world premiere in London and if you didn’t see it when it opened last year you are in for a real treat. The young actor, Ray Fearon is an absolute revelation. There is nothing about him that doesn’t make you want to find out more. Fearon does everything he can to make Othello not only a believable character but a believable performer. I particularly like how he portrays his uncle, Othello’s father. His role is incredibly challenging, which is why it is so thrilling to watch him. Fearon was only 14 when the show opened in Stratford but has since become a British theater star – first appearing in Manchester and now coming back to London to make his mark. In Othello he is a man who is not only utterly convincing as the character but also an utterly charming and charismatic actor. He brings to life the smugness and arrogance of Othello and the arrogance of the other characters. When the play started I was expecting the cast to have a lot of fun but they were focused on the script which takes us on a journey in time. The script has the reader delving into the minds of all of the characters as they try to solve the problem of Iago’s jealousy and jealousy. Fearon’s elegiac portrayal of Othello is stunning. He shows the intensity and power of Iago as he tries to kill his servants and his wife. He also shows how this powerful man is able to feel his own emotions through his rage and anger. I loved to see the way Fearon portrayed his character in a way that showed how he was driven by a fierce, dark desire and how this lead him to break free of Iago’s evil controlling behaviour. It was a performance that I was glad to see repeat because the production is so good. However, I can see why it is such a popular show. Even after the show was moved to London, critics were still complaining about Ray Fearon’s performance. People still had problems identifying which actor played the roles – in that production there were four – and the cast did a terrific job of playing the role of Othello. I enjoyed reading the comments about the cast because they seemed to show that they were in great spirits and they were confident that they had the right people in the right roles for the part. I hope that all the cast do as well in the future. The production was also fantastic because I’ve seen many productions over the years. Othello is definitely a top five show for me, despite the fact that I admit that I am a bit biased.","The production is moving to London Stratford now. It has taken a long time for a professional production to be put together in London and the cast is settling in to their new homes. Ray Fearon is the perfect lead actor for Othello. His charismatic persona, heightened by the power of his language, allows him to shine through the tumultuous scenes. The direction by David Hayward is superb and it’s a delight to watch him develop as the leading character. The costumes and set are beautiful and have added to the dramatic tensions in the play. I especially enjoyed the way that the actors worked with the audience to retell the story in different ways. The best part is that the whole ensemble works well together, and although it’s still a tight script, Stratford has become a safe haven for these talented actors. The performances are outstanding. Othello runs until 16 April 2016 at the RSC, and tickets are £20.","What is in a name? What is a person and a place? How can you make amends with an unfair review? In the end, I don’t know the answer to that question. But this is the beginning of a new theatre experience for me and I hope that it allows me to make amends for a bad review that I once wrote of a theatre production that I saw last spring. “Answer” is what this story is all about. It is what the reader will be reading when it has been edited to a reasonable size so that the material is comprehensible for all readers. This means that each sentence will only have about 30 words, with 5 words meaning a single syllable. (This is a very readable story.) This is the first time that I have written a play about Shakespeare because the Stratford production had so many good points and I felt that the show could have benefitted from a few changes. Then I noticed that Fearon has been brought in to play Othello, a role that he has previously played in his native Ireland as well as in Japan, where he has a great success at attracting an international audience. His casting makes him an obvious choice. He has been a big hit in his native Ireland, and in his performances at Stratford, he has also adapted a film version of Romeo and Juliet. But the greatest thing about Ray Fearon is that he brings a wealth of talent and experience to the part. He is a versatile actor and brings a natural warmth and wit to the character of Othello. He shows a true grasp of the character and of Shakespeare’s humour. He is a great choice and I wish the audience and the cast all the best in this new production.","I was lucky enough to see the show last spring at Stratford, and was therefore in a better position to criticise Othello in this version of the play. It is not as though the performance has diminished much from the original production. Unlike Shakespeare, the actors in this production have aged gracefully, their characters have matured, and the performance of the role itself has improved, with Fearon in particular showing more maturity. He even gets more of a chance to grow as an actor. The play has been rewritten by director Jonathon Etheridge, and with a new production team concentrating on the acting rather than on musical direction, he reveals a strong talent that will make a significant contribution to the production of this year’s Olivier Award winner. He certainly deserves his reputation as one of the country’s leading actors and perhaps the best actor in the English language."
C2,"Keith and Dawne wondered how on earth they would find out how that school group was so fit and healthy with hardly a single Italian in sight. Then Dawne told Keith, “I guess you have guessed.” Clearly Keith had.","Keith and Dawne laughed at this and felt guilty at stealing the holiday, but they quickly agreed that they would not do it again. The Wrong Country Uncle was glad that Keith and Dawne had stolen the holiday.",Keith and Dawne wondered what he had done.,"Keith and Dawne were very glad they had booked the right country for them on their holiday. They looked forward to being in Venice, with the bright lights and colourful canals of this lovely fairyland city. However it turned out that they had booked the wrong place! A school group from the south coast had booked that package holiday and booked a table at the Pensione Concordia. Keith and Dawne decided to leave immediately because the other members of that package were so obviously not real Italians! The Wrong Country Uncle thought they were in Venice when the school group arrived, they were sitting in a group at the bar on the rooftop terrace with a glass of wine. But when they arrived at the hotel they were in a huddle in front of the door which the school group had locked! The Wrong Country Uncle yelled out to him and the others in the huddle that they had gone to the wrong place! The Wrong Country Uncle yelled back and the school group had left the place!","Keith and Dawne had arranged their trip together after a long argument. Dawne told Keith what she thought and Keith was not convinced. Then he threw out a theory: if they were in the wrong country they would be in the right place, that’s why they had taken the package holiday. Keith had never learnt that word in English. The Wrong Country Uncle could not understand what Keith meant, so the other members of the package holiday who were in the wrong place could only guess at what Keith was thinking.","The Wrong Country Keith and Dawne were going to Italy with their uncle when one day it occurred to them that they had chosen the wrong country. When the school group arrived at their hotel at 6 o'clock in the morning, Keith went to the reception desk where they were supposed to be met. Instead, the desk clerk pointed out that the hotel was actually in New York instead of Venice. Dawne wondered aloud why the school group hadn't noticed this. Keith and Dawne didn't explain why they stayed in New York but continued their walk. They passed the Manhattan Bridge, the Statue of Liberty, and the Empire State Building. The tour guide told them how all the buildings on the island were in different stages of development and that some of them would have to be restored. However, their guide seemed very confident and looked like an ice-man. Keith and Dawne had forgotten to pack some food for their sandwiches so they had to settle for canned tomatoes. After lunch the guide announced that the group had booked a taxi to take them to Piazza San Marco and he was told that when they arrived at the hotel they would be taken directly to the hotel. When Keith and Dawne reached the Hotel, the doorman said that when they checked in they would be given directions to the correct Hotel. But instead, they were taken to the wrong Hotel. They walked through a small doorway where the doorman shouted at them. The group went to the wrong hotel. Keith and Dawne were relieved to find that they were the only people to check in. The travel agency clerk explained to them that the school group wanted to go to a special restaurant and they were not allowed to go there. Keith and Dawne waited in the lobby for the group to arrive. Keith and Dawne were happy that the children on the bus had to be allowed to be there in the correct place to make their first impressions. Keith and Dawne arrived at the hotel and were amazed to see the ice man had not shown up when they thought he would. Keith and Dawne were amazed when they discovered that the hotel had a very small bar. They sat down and ordered a glass of sparkling limoncello. The waitress said, ""It was very cold. It was very cold. And we had to wait for a long time because there were only six rooms. Then it was colder and colder."" Keith and Dawne both began to cry because they were so scared. They quickly went to the reception desk to get some more water and a sprinkling of snow.","Keith and Dawne were in Venice when they saw the school group sitting down on their chairs in the hotel lounge reading the papers on their laptops. They were not alone. Everyone else seemed to be in their pjs, eating sandwiches, looking at maps and even eating ice cream. Keith couldn’t understand why they were so shocked. It seemed like something you had experienced when in a foreign country. The first time Keith and Dawne had been abroad was when Keith was two. After a while of thinking about it, he and Dawne came to the conclusion that perhaps it might have been because of the school group. Keith was worried that the school group might have figured out what was going on in the hotel. He wanted Dawne to feel at ease but she didn’t. He wanted her to know that although the other members of that particular package were all learning Italian, all of them were learning English. Keith tried to explain but in order not to sound stupid, he just repeated the usual English phrase, ‘Oh yes, it’s Italians speaking English’. Dawne took it as a compliment because she understood why Keith was confused about what was happening. Keith didn’t get angry about it at all. They could have done with a few of those drinks if they had been talking to each other."
C2,"Lions are great hunters. They can follow a prey from a wide range of directions, and hunt together in big packs. They also have a long history of solitary hunting and have never hunted together. But their behavior during the early morning or late evening can be more unpredictable. A couple of times, they have gathered near a water hole and watched as an older lion came along to take a drink. One time, one of them saw a cub in the water and was so enthralled that it licked the cat's ear. The other lion heard the cub and charged forward, only to have it run into another lion. As they chased after the cub, another lion made an entry through the waterhole. This time, it too licked its ear and ran into a lion. The cub became terrified and froze. The other lion followed and ran for cover, but that lion was too slow and it took a long time for him to realize the danger. As he sprinted down the waterhole, the lions circled around him, and soon he heard the cry of a young cub - and was frightened and ran from the pool. Eventually, he heard the roar and came closer to the lions, where he watched the rest of the lions get up and hunt, followed by a herd of wildebeests, leopards, cheetahs, and wild dogs. And so a tense and thrilling hunt ensued. When the lions finally caught the hunter, they devoured him and then snuffled his snout. ""Are you sure this is what you're going to do next?"" he asked. I asked if he was happy about the hunt, and he said yes, in a very fervent and powerful voice. ""No thank you. What do you think of what I just said? But what do you think of that?"" ""I think it looks cool. But what do you think of that?"" ""No thanks,"" I replied. ""There is no need to be cool."" And so the lions threw stones at him. His body shook violently for a short moment and then he continued to hunt. ""We don't need you to do this next time. You've caught us before."" The two lions continued their hunt and soon the young lion caught up with the older one and the younger one jumped onto the older one. The two older lions quickly followed the younger one and took it with them. As the young lion was chased away by the older one, the young lion began chasing the older lion. When his prey suddenly turned towards them, he quickly lunged for a head on the other lion before he could turn and paw it down. And when the older one squealed in alarm, he launched a warning charge. ""Hold on! Don't let that kill you!"" he shouted in fear as they both ran off. ""You are going to kill the younger lion soon!"" The adult lion roared again, and took the injured young one to the nearest water hole. Then he turned his attentions to the new lion. As he approached, he was pounced on by the younger lion, and the adult lion threw himself a punch. ""Get out of my way!"" I screamed. ""Get out of my way!"" He lunged at the younger lion and fell backward. ""The bigger one was eating. The younger lion took the bigger one down!"" he roared. ""You're a baby lion now!"" It turned out that this was a fight over territory. The younger lion went to attack first.","Observing Lions The next time I go to Africa I will take a few weeks to take a day off from work, not because I'm tired of the place, but because I've never taken a day off in many years. So for this day off I got up early and went to the lion sanctuary in Masai Mara. Here I saw five lions sitting together. The four males were regal and dignified. They stood guard over one male that had not caught a kill in his lifetime, just so he wouldn't take one for granted. They walked out to the other side of the enclosure and began to circle the prey. The lions watched intently. The males took a step towards the prey, but the lioness was still holding her ground. They waited in the morning, but the lioness was still waiting in the afternoon shadows. At first they seemed as though they wanted to eat her but in the end they didn't eat her, just like the lions had planned.","The pride of lions that inhabit the wilds of central Africa was born on the brink of extinction, for in the past only a few individuals survived to adulthood. At around 4000 years old, these great cats had once been considered a threat to humans, but now, as the lion population in Africa has increased and people are looking to the wilds for their food, their numbers are becoming so numerous that it has become impossible to monitor their population with any kind of precision. While the lions are the most popular topic of observation among scientists, there are many questions which are yet to be answered. How does an animal grow to its current size? How does it communicate with its social groups? How does it maintain the natural balance of its population? These are the questions and answers which I would like to answer in the coming weeks.","Two brothers watched their mother lion go for a walk along a tree line, as she tried to chase after a small, but hungry, baby lion. She wondered if lions were really social animals, even if they hunted together. But the lions seemed to be very petty and ungrateful towards each other.",Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. They seem to be archetypal social animals rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal. In this case their next meal.,"Watching lions was an amazing experience. It taught me about what animals in general can do, a lesson I will carry with me forever.","Observing Lions In the popular imagination lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey.

C2,"Dennis Tito and his wife, Joanna, have been offered the first two astronaut jobs on a Mars expedition that will see them - ostensibly - set off on their way to the Red Planet. But there will only be two, and not just any old couple, because Dennis Tito's mission is the first of a series of 501-day missions. As the news spread, the first of these would be a couple, Joanna and Dennis Tito, who are seeking middle-aged married couples to embark on the journey, which will include three stopovers at the surface of Mars. Both Titos are planning the trip as part of his Mars 2030 space programme which is now almost complete and will include a trip to the International Space Station in 2024 and a second mission to Mars in 2022. But the space programme, which is essentially just the first step in a multi-billion dollar attempt to colonise Mars, is due to be completed this summer. There is only one problem - as this is no ordinary spaceship: a 501-day round-trip is not short by any means and their cargo is designed to last for just 2 days, which means that the applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. Joanna was selected over her husband Dennis, who was selected for the mission by his wife Joanna. But it may not be just physical fitness or the couple's relationship that Tito is looking for. He is also looking for mental toughness. “The person would need to be mentally tough as well to deal with the challenges of the expedition and would need to be able to handle adversity,” Tito told news.com.au last year. The Titos are planning the mission in a spaceship, which can carry as many as 20 people. But if this is a 501-day round trip, the first step, according to the couple, would be a landing at Mars' surface where they could pick up and drop off supplies, then transfer to the space station. They would then return to Earth where they would face a final, and crucial, spacewalk. On the return trip, the candidates would reenter Earth and live in a hotel until it is ready for landing in 2022. Joanna's parents, a former Air Force officer and a widow, have also been selected for the mission. Tito's business partner, Michael Tito, is also involved in the project. The couple are also planning to start a business together - the Mars 2020 Mars Space Program - and have already begun discussions on potential partners. Both Titos are currently advising on the project, but the couple are planning to get their applications together before any competitions start. Joanna said the first space missions were always exciting but the idea of making the journey was becoming increasingly ""difficult"". But once the first astronauts have arrived on Mars, she said, ""it will begin to be less and less difficult"". Dennis Tito, a Canadian businessman and billionaire investor, is also looking to use the Mars 2020 Space Program as the next step in his own business empire, which currently employs about 18,000 people around the world and which he believes will be worth up to $8 billion. He is currently running an investment business, The Space Company, which is set to invest $4 billion in the space programme by 2022. Joanna said she was not expecting to make much money from the mission. After all, the journey to Mars should be able to double Tito's income and she would potentially be the first woman to have made it out alive. While Joanna's work is already paid for, she will only be entitled to one week off work a month when the mission ends. The couple were initially hoping to live off their investments, but their plans have been stalled by a failed venture. Tito is also trying to take some of the risk out of the job by putting his money behind a Mars capsule that will launch on 5 January 2018. However, an investigation by the Space Accident Investigation Board into Tito's plans revealed a failure of the capsule's propellant booster. By the time the capsule had been refueled, it could have been years since she had stepped foot on the moon. To prevent any complications in the future, her plan was to have the vehicle refuelled with more propellant before the capsule started to travel to the surface of Mars. Joanna is a full-time high school teacher, and has over 25 years experience in the classroom, a career that focuses on supporting special education. ""The decision to go to Mars wasn't influenced by the fact that they have been to Mars, but","A middle-aged married couple were the first humans to set foot on Mars in the late 1950s. Now that NASA, the International Space Station (ISS) and the International Space Station (ISS) have realised the potential of space travel in an unprecedented way, Dennis Tito’s Martian Space Company (MSC) has announced the first ever astronaut search to apply to join their 501-day round trip to the Red Planet. The two, aged 57 and 46, will travel from Earth to Mars in a capsule called the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The spaceship will be able to carry up to two people, while also allowing for two other crew members to arrive on the Red Planet after 501 days. Each crew member will be provided with oxygen, supplies and food and a “recreation package” that includes a helmet, spacesuit and water supply. Applicants must be physically fit and emotionally robust, with a high level of mental acuity and be willing to take risks with their personal lives. They will have to deal with the extreme environmental conditions that will inevitably prevail as Mars’ surface is not fully suited to human living. The capsule is designed to be used as a permanent base on Mars where manned exploration is scheduled to take place for over a thousand years. It’s been reported that some future Mars missions could have three crew members on board. This would be to ensure that life could continue on Mars if the mission would go forward, even if a future human race is not established on the Red Planet.","Despite the risks, Dennis Tito’s plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 look set to bring humans to the Red Planet. At 60, Dennis and his wife, Nicola, are ready to take on the challenge and would be grateful for someone who is physically, emotionally and financially robust to make a tough journey there. To fulfil the roles, the couple must be fit and healthy, and must be prepared to fly the capsule themselves. If they get to Mars, Dennis and Nicola will have to spend three months undergoing a gruelling training regime with an emphasis on exercise and strength training. Nicola, 61, is a qualified aerobics instructor who loves training her husband in her favourite sport. If they succeed, Dennis and Nicola will get to experience life on Mars, and to see if it is the place they wanted to spend their retirement. In addition, they will receive a monthly salary and accommodation for two years in Mars’ climate, complete with all the creature comforts of home. “It’s a big deal because it’s a lot of fun. We’ll have an astronaut chef there and all the standard space stuff and we’ll have a beautiful symphony orchestra. It’s an amazing opportunity,” he told the Daily Mail in February. However, a number of issues raised by Nicola and Dennis have kept the company in the spotlight recently. Last year, after being contacted by a prominent space organisation, Tito asked to be filmed for a documentary called “Mars to Mars”, where he spoke with Nicola and Dennis about the challenges of living on Mars.","The first person to reach the Red Planet will be a middle-aged married couple from a developed country.

There is no direct route to Mars. There is a short space station at the Mars base. The Mars Base Station is a very large space station on Earth. The area at the base station is about 300 miles across. There is a road that goes around the space station and there is access to the underground at the base station where the capsule would land.” This is the third space station that Dennis Tito has designed, and he was the first to get his name approved. Applicants need to be physically and emotionally robust. The last space station that reached Mars was the space station at Saturn that landed in 1992. The Space Station was a short trip away from Mars. Dennis Tito had the first space station on earth launched in 1993. Applicants need to be physically and emotionally robust. The first space station that reached Mars was the space station at Saturn. This was a long trip away from Mars. What does a middle-aged married couple need to look like for a 501-day round trip to Mars?","Mars will be the next step in human civilisations exploration of our solar system. However, to get there, we will need to travel to another world, a world with a magnetic pole called Mercury. This will take a year, during which time we will travel through the solar system with all its creatures and plants, meeting up with other crew members, as well as a Mars Lander which will then land on Mars. On arrival, we will stay for several weeks to find out why humans have travelled the stars for so long and how the planets of our solar system might have differing characteristics. What should we expect during these 501-days on Mars? What is it like living on Mars? Do humans interact differently than in Earth’s space? What will the life on Mars be like?",Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust.,"Martian pilots want applicants with a minimum age of 44 and a maximum age of 80. The capsule will carry a crew of three. The cheapest ticket to Mars costs £1,900, with the cost per day rising to £600 if flights to Mars go ahead in January 2018. However, if this doesn’t happen, the cost of flights to Mars will increase and a second spacecraft containing more than 7,000 lbs of equipment and crew will go ahead in 2018. One of the Mars landing pods will remain on the surface for more than 2 years, to collect samples, then return to Earth. If successful, astronauts will work with the same crew who will follow the couple back to Mars. The Mars mission has already been funded by the billionaire Dennis Tito and his wife, who set up the company Planetary Resources when he first made the offer to go to Mars. The initial cost of Mars will be £1,300 each and there will be an additional £108 000 for a small crew to pay for the transportation. The trip to Mars will be the first time humans have travelled to another planet. But if successful, the mission will have a lasting effect on humanity. It will be a milestone in human history."
C2,"The lorry transporting the waste disappears for a while, when the lorry is picked up by the same sort of lorry which takes away the rubbish from the rest of the world. A few hours later, after the waste has been taken to the local tip, the lorry returns. The contents of that lorry are then delivered back to households, ready for new homes. The people’s idea of how this works has been thoroughly and critically analysed. What might cause an average family to refuse to dispose of rubbish? What would make families more likely to buy new homes? It is unlikely that many people would take this as an economic or environmental solution. But it seems to be a useful starting point. After careful analysis, a paper by the Danish research team Fjling av Eyneküler og Yrnym and Lars Erik Olson examines this idea and considers its effects on people’s consumption of food, their behaviour when shopping and the amount of rubbish they produce. It suggests a shift in attitude whereby the waste bin isn’t always perceived as such. But it also suggests that in the right hands, this could be a way to improve the environment. The study takes a case study in which Swedish households are surveyed. Their results show that most have refused to pay for recycling, although they are likely to do so in the future, given the government’s intention to make all households pay for recycling. They also reveal that the majority of those surveyed do not recycle at all. A third of the households did not recycle. Half of those surveyed did not recycle. Many more are also not doing so properly. The study shows that half of Swedish households throw away recyclables while 28% of those surveyed do not take them to the tip. The study also reveals that households are more likely to have plastic bags, which contain non-biodegradable waste, in their bins than paper or cardboard. The study also looks at some potential benefits of a change in attitude from those who produce a lot of waste. It concludes that a change in attitude to waste will be more beneficial in the long run than simply introducing charges.","The government, therefore, has introduced a bill that would charge families for every bag of rubbish they produce, an idea that has received widespread media attention. It was suggested during the Brexit negotiations by a number of people, including one of the UK's mayors.","SANTA CLARA (Reuters) - In a move that reveals a desire to reduce waste, a San Francisco City Council committee has voted to charge residents for each bag of rubbish they produce. The proposal would place the burden of this expense on local residents, encouraging them to reuse and recycle the refuse they produce, rather than throwing it in the rubbish bin. The proposed fee – based on the size of each bag, not how much rubbish was produced – is set to be a minimum of $2.50, or about $0.25 per kilowatt-hour. According to the city government, this cost will help the municipality to reduce waste by helping those who don't have recycling bins or other alternatives. Meanwhile, the cost for those who do have recycling bins or other alternatives will rise to $15 per kilowatt-hour. This will help to fund environmental projects and improve the city's air quality. The money collected at the tip will not be taxed. The proposal is considered a boon for San Francisco residents and the city government hopes it will prove popular with city voters.",How did the Germans manage to live so cheaply? I think it was the combination of cheap labour and cheap technology.,"A recent experiment in the United Kingdom has shown how recycling can actually boost the economy of local government, according to a new report by the University of Bristol, which comes just in time for National Recycling Week. A small number of households are able to recycle a maximum of three items: newspapers, magazines and plastic bottles. But for all those that are able to recycle, the amount of rubbish they generate can be staggering: many families discard half their total rubbish as recyclables in the first place. That has to be the most expensive rubbish to produce; a couple of bags of cardboard and glass will often end up as worthless, while the rest are deemed to be either perfectly recyclable, or perfectly inedible. At least one person in the UK’s most fashionable housing estate is turning down offers to recycle some of her used clothes. Another family refuses to throw away their tin cans as it’s clear that they’re just an eyesore. A third family has taken advantage of the new fee structure, by dumping their old laptops, computers, washing machines and TVs into a communal recycling bin for free. But those that haven’t thrown away their old florescent bulbs have had their rubbish thrown into the communal bin for free, too. It’s just not as easy to recycle old rags and newspapers; after all, they’re only as useful as they are old. Even if they were recycling, some of the paper would end up as rubbish anyway; this is not something we can recycle.","Garbage in, garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be.",Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be.
C2,"I had climbed onto the fence to take photos and see the horses in action. There were only three riders on the course in the middle of the race, and they sounded like they were having great fun. As I approached the gate I noticed the goats were on a course they shouldn't have been on. When I got to the gate there was a man on a horse, I leaned over and asked him if he was the rider. He looked at me then said he was. ""How old are you?"" I thought to myself, ""How old are you?"" I saw that he was the horse’s rider, he seemed a good fit to me. I told the man to get back in his horse and I was off on a journey with them! I walked back to the stand and snapped a few pictures and got back to the arena. I saw the horses in a cage in the far back corner of the arena, they looked like saggy, overstuffed babies. I was in awe of these magnificent creatures, I didn't know I could watch them on a daily basis. There were people on all sides of the fence cheering the horses as they passed; one was a young girl stomping her feet, another a woman shrieking with joy when they passed. I had so much fun, I would probably never get bored of seeing these races again. My little cousin is in the final stages of putting together his collection of goat racing clothes so I am going to be a part of his collection too! I will keep you updated and make sure I post this. Good luck with your challenge!","I was excited as I had not seen goat racing before. The goats were a spirited spectacle. This would be the first time I had seen goat racing. As the goats paced the muddy course, I could see the excitement in the eared goat’s eyes as they darted between the obstacles and the finish line. This was a great sight to witness and I jumped for joy. “So that’s what I’ve been waiting for?” said my friends and family as they cheered.","I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans, hordes of people, food stalls and hot music singing to my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse, I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. I watched as the goats raced down the track, and I saw some goats get knocked over. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse, I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. The goats were running across the track and I watched the animals trying to escape, but there was not much time left in the race. When the race was over, the goats were still running along the track, and it was obvious the goats were feeling the heat. The crowd cheered the goats on as they were successful.","The goat race started at ten o'clock. As the crowd waited for the runners to arrive the goats began to race. Goats are known for their athletic ability so it was a sight to see. Whenever a goat reached the finish line it did so triumphantly. However there was one goat that did not come from the usual breed. The goats that raced that day weighed in at 1lb, 4oz and 2kg. All the other goats, both males and females, weighed in at 1lb, 1oz and 1kg. The winner of the races was an impressive 1.8 kg! In fact it's believed that only one goat could be weighed at such a heavy weight. For his efforts he earned $800,000!","I didn’t care about getting a good pitch, I wanted to be near the goats.... I couldn’t decide which goat to focus on, I had to have a look at the goats’ personalities and their mannerisms. Once I had my goat figured out I could concentrate on the main event and I was able to make a pretty good decision. The first goat, a black boy with the odd black turban and a moustache who had one black eye, had the look of a well-trained show goat and he made for a very attractive goat. The second goat was white and had a small head and a small body, so I decided to focus on the male goats, I wanted to identify which goat was a good contender and who was a no-show. I picked a goat and headed towards the barn to give it some time before heading back to my car.","I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village.

I was ecstatic to see the goats jumping wildly at the start of the race. Then it was time for the race to start, and I couldn’t get a good view. Then the goats took a turn and raced straight at the crowd. There were cheers all around, and I was relieved to see my goats finish just in front of the winner, a small girl named Jane. Jane’s goat was an incredibly fast goat. I was amazed to see it catching the others off guard. When the race was over, I was so excited. It was the first time I had ever been to a goat race. I could barely keep my balance as I ran along the track to make sure I wouldn’t fall down. Luckily, Jane was ok. I grabbed my goat and hopped on to the field. After some time, a large black goat leapt out of the stall, and raced right up to Jane. She paused for a moment, took another jump, and finished the race in just over eight seconds. What a sight!","I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans, hordes of people, food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums.

C2,"While I have no problem with the use of oral evidence, I have some reservations about its use as primary source. I have studied the history of language acquisition and memory in particular and this has led me to the conclusion that it can become distorted in its representation of people’s thoughts and experiences. I have also come to the conclusion that it is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. If I am correct in this view, then why are so many historians reliant on oral evidence? A recent example of this problem has come to light in the recent article written by Dr Richard Cummings on the subject of oral history. Cummings examines various aspects of oral evidence and why it can be trusted. He argues that the growing trend to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. He also suggests that it may also be possible to skew an interview by revealing irrelevant or misleading information, and he suggests that the way an interview is conducted has been shown to affect the person giving the testimony. Dr Cummings’ research is supported by many articles, a paper, a podcast, and the Guardians website, but he is not alone in his scepticism.","Almost everyone knows that there is an oral history. For more than a few centuries it has been a popular source of information. It can be the foundation of an entire history, and the evidence used to prove it can be interpreted by historians as evidence in court, or for any number of other purposes. The growing trend in the use of oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. The interviews themselves can be manipulated and rewritten by the interviewer to suit their particular needs. For example, the two witnesses might differ in what happened during the interview, or the interviewer might modify what they said a few minutes later in order to fit the other party in. In addition, the interviewee might change their story or present a false narrative at a later date. Ultimately, the process of writing an oral history is an important step in developing the history of a place and time.","A group of three young men sat together, wearing glasses, to record a conversation which they both had in a coffee shop. The first man was a young man, now aged fourteen, and he spoke about two things: how the war was going in Syria and how the army had been treating his wife and his daughter. After the two men finished recording their conversation, a group of two young men, both men of the same age, walked away. Despite the distance, the men talked a long time. A couple of weeks later, one of the men came and asked if they could listen to the conversation. The man agreed and, having listened to it for an hour or so, made some comments about how he had been a good soldier.",Oral history is still being investigated in large numbers. It has become one of the most important sources of data for historians and explains a lot about the past. Today's lesson begins with a story in which two old friends talk about the things they remember about each other. They talk about the things they know in their memories and that's it. The history lesson ends with a discussion about this evidence.,"The growth in use of oral history as a form of history is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone’s testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. An example of this phenomenon occurred last year when I interviewed a group of refugees from a war zone. Many of these people had no memories of the war, because many of them had never lived through it. It is no wonder that their testimony was skewed by memories of their own experience, as I found out.",The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems.

Only tea. So I don’t need to order a cup of coffee.’ ‘You don’t want any coffee do you?’ he asked, ‘I have to have a cigarette after this meeting, so I am still hungry for something to eat.’","Lancelot was so surprised at his secretary’s lack of attention that he shook his head. “What? Why not?” said Lancelot, looking into the secretary’s eyes with wonder and disbelief. His secretary chuckled. Lancelot was so used to her that he hadn’t had to explain herself. His secretary thought that was very funny.","Lancelot sat at a table in the staff room surrounded by a few desks. Behind him was a stack of envelopes, but Lancelot was standing just next to it.","Lancelot was working the night shift when his secretary called in sick. He had no one at his desk that morning but his secretary. She fumbled for the sugar and quickly looked down at Lancelot. 'I am afraid I cannot do that. The pound is going to fall through my teeth.' Lancelot shook his head. 'No, you can't have any. It's too hot and I'm tired.' He sighed. 'Of course not' the secretary said. Her face lit up with astonishment.","Lancelot was sitting in his favourite chair with his eyes closed, writing a note with a pen in his left hand. He waited for the secretary to answer, hoping that she would not have forgotten to add sugar - but she was just too annoyed. It seemed the best thing she could do was to start talking to Lancelot. The secretary had no idea that Lancelot took sugar, although he had clearly mentioned it to her as well as to Lancelot himself. He couldn’t believe that there had been no sugar in the coffee when he woke up, and so he asked the secretary to get him a cup of tea instead. When the secretary refused, Lancelot shook his head, saying 'It won't be any good if it is.' She explained that Lancelot had taken a few cups of tea to see how it tasted, but then he realised that he had taken quite a lot of coffee and had probably gotten drunk to the point of fainting. The secretary was surprised when the doctor told her that Lancelot had been drunk to the point of losing consciousness - but she was in no mood to argue."

She asked him why he hadn’t made a deal with Fred but Fred was not buying anything. It was a terrible thought and she called for help. Fred was too busy to help her so she called on a woman on the phone. She called her name and asked her to give Fred a few minutes to calm down. Fred said that he would come back in a few minutes and he would come with the rest of his team. Fred said he had to find the other man as he had not found the other man yet.

C2,"I asked him, ‘Do you remember those dinosaurs?’ ‘Yes’ he said, ‘because they were funny when they were chomping on leaves. They also grew long legs and long arms, and they squished everything in their way’. He was fascinated. I wanted to know more, so I asked him, ‘Do you think dinosaurs have claws?’ ‘Yes, they used to eat the leaves and then swallow them. They used to bite the trees and then swallow them. That was scary’.",Then I asked my husband about dinosaurs. ‘It’s a show about a dinosaur called Jurassic World’ he said. ‘In the show a Jurassic World dinosaur named Tyrannosaurus rex goes for a walk and suddenly eats a dinosaur. Suddenly it turns round and runs away. The dinosaurs yell at him. He yells a lot so I decided to see how much my son remembered. ‘I know it’s about a dinosaur named Tyrannosaurus. He says he is a little dinosaur and comes to the party looking fierce. The dinosaurs run off when the Tyrannosaurus eats one.,"Yes, dinosaurs existed and he’s aware that. But for my six-year-old to be eating noodles like that was the perfect example of screen learning. I explained it to him that he had just seen a programme about a tyrannosaurus. The programme was called T-Rex and featured a bunch of little kids pretending to be dinosaurs by playing with dinosaur parts. It took me a while to realise that he had just been pretending to be a dinosaur. If he had been watching a dinosaur programme then he would have known there were some big tyrannosaurus lurking around. He has now learned that it was quite dangerous for tyrannosaurus to eat humans so he has been pretending to be a dinosaur while eating noodles. He didn’t tell me what dinosaur it was though. So, he has now discovered the tyrannosaurus is a different animal to the tyrannosaurus. My six-year-old has learned a valuable lesson.","‘Ta ta’ said my son. Then I said ‘Do you remember when dinosaurs ate food? How big was a dinosaur?’ ‘Hey’ he said, ‘I can see a real dino today. He was in the park’.","We watched Dinosaur Island, a series of programmes about dinosaurs on TV. We heard a lot about the Pterosaur family, who lived in South America. There were also special dinosaurs, called Tyrannosaurs, who lived in North America. They were hunted by birds and even rodents, and they looked like very fierce and scary animals. However, in our programme, T-Rex is not a big meat-eater and is not even really a dino. He only eats a small amount of meat, and he does not eat too much. Nonetheless, T-Rex seems to have learned a lot about dinosaurs. He is a very good at drawing them and identifying what they look like. You can see that his drawings are very realistic. As well as this, he learns a lot about how dinosaurs lived. He likes to find things and make a mess. For example, he once made a poop out of tomato sauce and hid it. In the TV programme, the Dinosaur Island series, we saw a few clips of people eating dinosaur-themed food. The dinosaurs would have to be big and strong to eat a lot of food, so the dinosaurs ate a lot of noodles and rice.","My six-year-old son loved dinosaurs. He was obsessed with them! One day, when he went to the local library, I showed him an interesting article on dinosaurs. I asked him some questions about the creatures. When he couldn’t answer, I told him that dinosaurs were very smart. He thought it was very interesting. So, he decided to look up the dinosaur names for all animals. Then he looked up the word ‘reptilians’ and he wrote the following sentences: Reptilians are large and powerful dinosaurs. They could be big enough to kill large animals. They were also very fast. They had powerful teeth. This dinosaur looks like a retilisor. It is very fast and it uses its teeth to bite its prey. This dinosaur looks like a small retilisor. It’s not very fast. The retilisor is a small dinosaur. The retilisor is a small dinosaur.","I am very proud of you, your Dad. It’s so good to hear that you are proud of your son because he is an expert on dinosaurs. I think he is a very clever boy. You should ask him about his dinosaurs when he is older. Surely he would tell you all about them.’"
C2,"There is a long and interesting history of bamboo construction from bicycles to furniture to medicine and to this day it is still considered a versatile material in the workshop. What we see today, though, is a different story. At the Bamboo Bike Club run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan you can buy a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of building a bike from scratch. This workshop takes place on Saturday, May 19, at St Mark’s School in Edinburgh, and costs £1,100. After buying your frame, you can also use the workshop to upgrade it. The workshop allows you to design your own bike with the help of engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, two bike enthusiasts with a keen interest in eco-friendly building. The bikes come in several styles and price ranges, so it is important to make a choice that suits your budget. The first computer-designed frame was designed for Tom and Andy, who have been using the workshop for more than a year. Andy’s bike has since won the 2012 Tour of Scotland, while Tom’s bike came second in the 2015 Trek XC. The workshop also holds workshops on how to use a CNC machine for creating intricate bike frames – such as the bike shown in the photo. James says the course costs £70 for the frame, which includes the computer-designed frame and two days of working with a 3D printer. The building weekend begins with a tour of the workshop. If you want to build a bike from a kit, the club makes available frames for £60, and there’s a £50 deposit. James, who runs Bamboo Bike Club with Ian, says the course is also for those who want to learn more about sustainable building, but aren’t interested in designing their own frame.","This is the first time the Bamboo Bike Club has taught anyone how to build a bicycle from scratch. When the bike-making team from Oxfordshire opened the first club this weekend they didn’t expect it to be a success. This man is clearly not the same man they were when they set up the first workshop in 2012 in the tiny village of Hazelburn, near Oxford. So when the guys at the Bamboo Bike Club opened the first workshop in the UK two years ago they took everything they knew about the craft of bicycle building and redesigned it as a fun weekend.","The UK's first bamboo bike workshop is a popular and environmentally friendly way of getting around, so you can build yourself a custom frame from start to finish. If you’re not entirely satisfied with the frame you buy, you can create your own. The weekend-long workshop, held in Kent this June, costs £445 for a fully computer-designed frame, plus a fun weekend of building a bike with a help from the engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. It’s a good idea to wear clothes and tools you are comfortable with. You can also bring your own bicycle, and bring along a group of friends. The bike can be made into something sporty, or something sleek and high-tech, with custom accessories like decals and paint applied. Bike-builders will also get a certificate at the end of the weekend. You can buy a frame for £1,500 (US$1,985) from the bamboo-bike club’s website. Or if you want a cheaper custom bicycle, a frame from the company’s factory will cost £495 (US$5,945). A workshop such as this has potential to transform bike-building in the UK, where bike-riding has been restricted for many years because it requires a considerable amount of skill and tools. The bamboo bike company has made a significant impact on cycling, especially in Britain. Its products include an impressively robust mountain bike which can get a ride up to 30 miles with a single bottle of water and weigh just 2.4 kg. The frame of the bike can be made from bamboo or steel. Bamboo is a renewable, eco-friendly material that can be made into a great-looking frame, but costs more than other alternatives. Some companies have tried to use bamboo for frames to make them lighter, and this has had the unintended consequence of making them lighter. The company is making a small impact by using bamboo in more exotic ways. Bamboo is also a renewable resource. The bamboo used in the bamboo bicycles is sourced from sustainable sources including rubber trees. But the carbon-dioxide emissions associated with the process can be high and therefore it’s not recommended for the majority of British cyclists. Another thing that sets bamboo apart is its strength, which makes it less susceptible to cracking. Bike owners are also able to find bamboo in a variety of sizes. At £450, you can buy a computer-designed frame and a fun weekend of building with other bike enthusiasts.","In this short video, watch as the two engineers who founded the Bamboo Bike Club in London show you how to build a custom frame from bamboo and why it’s a sustainable and environmentally friendly choice. If you can’t imagine getting around in an ordinary bicycle, this might just get your mind around it. The workshop is for experienced bike builders, but any keen biker can learn all about the construction and design process – you’ll learn how to set up a bicycle frame using a computer, which isn’t a requirement. But you’ll need to know how to use a hammer and a piece of wood that you pick up from a store (that you could actually buy – there is a huge selection of old bikes and old motors in the shop). After the weekend, a bike made from bamboo will be handed back to you.","The first bike workshop dedicated to creating a bamboo bike has opened in Nottingham. Engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan hope to teach people how to build their own custom bikes out of sustainably sourced wood. The idea for Bamboo Bike Club comes from the pair’s experiences as engineers working on bicycles using wood. Marr and McMillan say their designs have been tweaked to use more eco-friendly materials, such as cork and bamboo, but the final product looks a lot more expensive than the average aluminium bicycle. They figured their customers wouldn’t want to build their own bikes on the cheap, so they started with a low cost computer-designed bike, which they sourced from the Indonesian manufacturer Arata Bikes, with a few extras, such as bamboo pedals. “We designed an inexpensive frame that had a good set of components. That helped a lot,” explains one customer. “You can choose your own parts for your bike, you can choose what to build yourself. We were able to use some of the materials we found here from Arata Bikes because we wanted the bike to be sustainable,” says another customer. They chose to get a frame that had lots of extras for an extra £300. They worked around the clock to make their frames, which were assembled in a three-day intensive course over the weekend. They had to jigsaw together the dozens of pieces of bamboo, whittle away the excess wood, drill holes in the sides, and attach them to the frame. With the frame done, the two of them gave their new creations a coat of paint. The bicycles are available for a limited time to test out the performance. If you fancy yourself as a future bike engineer, there are two courses left in November — one focused on building and one on bike design — that start at £290.","BRISTOL, England — Building your own bamboo bike — that’s what’s on offer in the first ever computer-designed and built bike workshop in the UK. The two-day weekend course covers frame making, welding, and powder coating, and costs £750. Students spend five days working on a bike of their choice and spend two hours with the bikes every day. It's an ideal gift for someone who has lots of bric-a-brac, and you can even get the tyres you need — and the bike — from bamboo. The process starts with a computer designed frame that’s designed just for you. A computer design is then imported to the workshop and you’ll build it from scratch — using tools and parts sourced locally. For more information, visit bamboobiking.co.uk.","The bike is made from bamboo, which has a similar strength to steel, and is easily shaped with a router. The first bike-building workshop in the UK to use this sustainable wood is Bamboo Bike Club, run by James Marr and Ian McMillan. They believe bikes made of bamboo will be far more akin to high-tech vehicles than traditional bikes. They design a frame for you using computer-aided design software, which takes in your height and weight and creates a design of the parts that will go on the bike. Then the frame is computer-made and assembled with your help. On a course, which starts with two days’ tuition, you get to build and paint your own custom bike using a computer-designed kit - along with a little help from friends and family. It costs £500 to build the frame, which is made from a solid block of bamboo, and it takes just three hours to complete. ""A bike is more of a work of art and it's a really tactile thing, the people you meet you share the same enthusiasm about what you're doing and that's really important when you're doing something that's your passion - building a bike is a lot of fun,"" said James."
C2,"A researcher named Jim Cheney, in a recent article in the British journal Nature, discovered that the dominant male in a group of African vervet monkeys was not intimidated by the presence of a stranger in his territory. ""This male is a very social male, often seen playing with his young. We think he had seen other males in our territory, perhaps even the females,"" Cheney says, referring to the vervet monkeys. ""But the dominant male has been very confident and had not acted out."" The stranger in the grove was quite obviously interested in joining the vervet monkey group, and he had found the vervet monkeys to be a very sociable species. He chose a nearby tree to hide and start chatting with the monkeys, in hopes of joining one of their groups. However, this was a poor move. ""The other male was obviously not ready to commit to being part of any of our groups. He showed little interest in sharing our territory with us or going anywhere near our trees, and the dominant male was very much aware of that."" In their experiment, Cheney and Seyfarth have taken two of the three groups that the vervet monkeys were part of, and the dominant male has been unable to get his monkeys to join him. After several attempts, Cheney and Seyfarth believe that the two groups have not actually crossed paths at all, but the dominant male has never been seen by any other members of the group. There is a reason for this, however, as the dominant male is a strong leader amongst the group, and is also one of the most vocal when it comes to communication with the group. The dominant male is often seen with one female and the new male is seen spending time with all three groups. This shows that the new male is not attracted to the sociability of the vervet monkeys, and probably has no desire to join them. The dominating male, as well as being a great leader amongst the group, also has a great ability to sway other males to join his group, and he has been known to do this while he was a dominant member of the group. When he finally decides he wants to join a group, he does not show himself very aggressive. He is, however, a solitary creature. Despite having a good sense of smell, he does not frighten other males away. After several weeks, Cheney and Seyfarth found that the new male had gone on to join another group. He now lives happily in a group with six other males, and the dominant male has been able to gain sufficient strength to take on a role as a leader.","A group of vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth studied were in a grove of trees a few kilometers from a large lake in the eastern African country of Botswana. They knew that the dominant male in the group, Mr. B, noticed a strange male hanging around in a nearby grove. They took him into custody so they could study him. They called him Mr. A. Eventually, the dominant male convinced him that Mr. B was in fact Mr. A’s brother, the group’s leader. Mr. A was very proud of his brother and wanted to join his group. “What is your name?” asked Mr. A. “Vervet monkey?” “You are Mr. A’s brother,” said Mr. A. The dominant male explained that his brother was already a member of the group. “We thought he would be very helpful with his intelligence and his fighting techniques,” explained Mr. A. “But Mr. A’s a little naughty and didn’t share his food or sleep with his brother as often as Mr. B did.” The dominant male rebuked Mr. A., saying that he was a threat to his friend, Mr. B. Mr. A told Mr. A. that he wanted to avoid confrontation and instead chose to work with Mr. A., giving Mr. A. some training exercises, showing him how to climb a tree and get at trees that he didn’t know how to climb. After all, the dominant male didn’t want to fight with a younger, weaker, hungry monkey. “No, I’m not going to fight with Mr. A’s brother,” said Mr. A. “You would have to fight with someone a lot stronger to win over Mr. B. He wouldn’t be able to climb a tree very far in his younger age and he’s already old enough to be very successful in his climbing abilities... But, I have a young brother and he’s smart. He’ll learn a lot from me and my skills will only get better, because he’s just young.” Mrs. A. felt confident that Mr. A’s brother would have no problem joining Mr. A’s group. When Mr. A was ready, Mrs. A. called Mr. A’s brother and told him to go away as he was going to fight with Mr. A’s brother. Mr. A was a very confident and strong youngster and had a lot of fighting experience in the past, so he knew how to make friends quickly. Mr. A had been hunting for vervet monkeys all his life, so he would already know what it’s like to be a leader. “You’ll never be a leader without having someone to follow you,” he concluded. “Your brother is really clever and can’t be beat. You’re probably not as strong and agile as Mr. A is.” Mr. A was impressed by Mr. A’s skills, and he decided to join Mr. A’s group as his mate. He became very jealous of Mr. A’s power and dominance, and kept after Mr. A’s brother, thinking he had some reason to be jealous of him.","Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day, a dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees.

To do this, they used the same method that humans do: they watched each monkey individually. In this situation, the dominant male had to get inside the group. He also could see the stranger’s intentions. For example, he could see that the stranger was standing in front of them and sniffing their food. He had to see whether they were alright with it. Also, he had to see how the monkeys used food. If they had not found any food, he would not have noticed it. Cheney and Seyfarth noticed that the monkeys shared a very special kind of food: figs. This special kind of food was a treat that only the males could share. They had to test a small area of the vervet monkey’s territory before putting the food on the ground.",Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees.

He also swung his tail wildly towards the stranger. The dominant male jumped up and knocked him out. He continued to shake his head, screaming and swearing. He also tossed an egg at the stranger, which he immediately devoured. The monkey then attacked the stranger, stomping and kicking him. He then jumped to his death and then swung his tail towards him, which he smashed into the ground. The dominating male then attacked the man, killing him with his tail. The attacker then swung his tail around and stomped his tail once more. He was now eating the other monkey’s fruit."

For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. Aesthetic theory has to deal with the products (art works) of the human mind, a process that does not permit an analysis of the products by its internal structure and form. In order to do this, a theory has to be able to apply the results of its internal analysis to an external set of works (the works themselves). But without the external set of works – that is, an example of a work of art that has been studied thoroughly – aesthetic theory will have little to say about it.","I found this article on a wikiHow page about AESTHETICS. I took it from the website of an art journal called Aesthetiology and thought it would be a good read for all of my Grade 2 students. The article discusses art and aesthetics. A few sentences about art and aesthetics are included: Art is ""an act that enhances our ability to perceive and understand the world,"" explains the author. ""It is an emotion that we feel when we look at a painting, a piece of music, or a poem. It is a state of mind that makes us more able to feel things.""","AESTHETICS By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. Therefore art theory and aesthetics theory are concerned with perception and action alone. Aestetics does not deal with the phenomena of art itself, but only with the effects of the aesthetic experience. Aesthetics is concerned with the effects of the aesthetic experience. As such, aesthetics theory and aesthetics theory are concerned with perception and action alone. The first step towards the theory and practice of aesthetics is therefore to define what aesthetics is and what aesthetics theory is about. Since the notion of aesthetics is so vague and speculative, a brief survey of the philosophical approaches to aesthetics will suffice. Some have tried to define aesthetics in terms of the aesthetic experience, others with aesthetic theories. Some have attempted to define aesthetics in terms of the aesthetics theory itself. Some philosophers have attempted to define aesthetics in terms of aesthetics, such as aesthetic theory and aesthetics theory. Others have attempted to define aesthetics in terms of the aesthetic theory itself, such as the aesthetic theory of the aesthetic experience. In short, aesthetics theory is concerned with the effects that the aesthetic experience has on the human mind or mind's perception of the world. The first step towards the theory and practice of aesthetics is therefore to define what aesthetics theory is and what aesthetics theory is about. Many philosophers believe that aesthetics theory and aesthetics theory should deal with both perception and action only. They believe that these two processes, perception and action, constitute the ""art"" of aesthetics. Aesthetics theory and aesthetics theory have been attempted before. Each theory attempts to develop aesthetic theory in an attempt to explain why some events or actions are ""good"" and others are ""bad"" or ""undesirable"". This is similar to ""science"", ""philosophy"" and ""theology"". The main difference is that aesthetics theory and aesthetics theory are concerned with perception and action. The aim of both is to provide a systematic and objective view of the art. This is the only way in which art theory and aesthetics theory can be combined. For example, aesthetics theory and aesthetics theory can help us make sense of art in the same way that biology and chemistry have helped us make sense of their relationship."
C2,"Sand It didnt look like there were many car accidents in the sand. However a few days later a car made a horrific accident after it attempted to drive through some very deep sand. The car lost control and crashed into the sand. The driver was lucky to stay alive, he was able to walk out a little bit unscathed. There were a few injuries. One of them was a badly damaged nose. The driver was taken to hospital. After an operation the sand re-appeared in the head. The sand had escaped from the accident, but it had also contaminated the victim. They would require further medical treatment. The car will need to be repaired.","Sand Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete I am not a great fan of it in its natural state.

One day I went to the beach with my family. My mother and I had brought sandwiches and a little purse with us. Our intention was to leave the beach and look for a quiet place to relax. As we got closer to the sea, we started to see a few patches of sand on the ground near the water. It looked like it had not been there very long, so we didnt know if it had moved on. Nonetheless, we went to investigate. We walked through the sand and we found a slither of sand. We also found a coin that had been swallowed by the sand. We also found a seagull that was eating sand off the cliff. Finally, we came upon a huge pile of sand in the middle of the beach. It had not been there for more than half an hour, so it must have been there for a long time. Finally, the sand came back up out of the sea and made its way back home with my family.","Sand Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete I am not a great fan of it in its natural state.

I decided that I would have to put it out of my mind. If you could just get rid of it you could make your own beach.","At a seaside car park on a hot summer day, I had to cross a sandy road to get to the car park.

C2,"For art to thrive on television it would need to take in at least three aspects: The viewers should have the ability to know the artist; the viewer should be in a position to judge what they like and understand how they worked, and the viewer should be able to buy art which they have seen (in a gallery or in a museum). As viewers can only really understand visual arts through viewing the objects on display, television would have to make a major effort to show the viewer what they are seeing — not the other way round. Yet we rarely see this; instead we are shown the general appearance of the work, which – at best – may convey a misleading impression of its beauty. I recently saw an episode of The Week In Art which was filled with a series of photos showing the sculptures on display at the National Gallery of Victoria, but the viewer was unable to appreciate the work because the images were cropped to just two square metres. The only other time when the subject of art has been shown on television has been a programme about the architecture of a museum or exhibition space; it was even shown in one episode. One of the most strikingly beautiful pieces in this series was a sculptural table by Irmgard Freud. The artist has been called ‘one of the greatest sculptors of our time’ by the London Times and a ‘global phenomenon’ by Time Out.","After watching such a variety of art programmes, I’m wondering why tv artists aren’t more widely known.","As the new term dawns I cannot help but be disappointed to see a growing number of paintings and sculptures being shown on TV. However, the newest addition to this growing group of artworks on TV are works by artist, David Hockney. Although he works from an early age and has a strong social influence, his work is rather mundane, the subject only being discussed in general terms. To see a full life-sized painting is enough for most viewers. To see a detail of a work is even more difficult for most viewers. Fortunately, an animated piece which follows Hockney through a studio setting has been chosen to demonstrate these problems. Using live painting, which takes the audience through the studio to a real painting, the programme shows it all in great detail, with Hockney himself guiding the viewer from a large studio to a close-up of the details. The programme shows a large painting then slowly zooms in on small features which highlight the painting’s beauty. While it may not be a great introduction to Hockney’s work, the animation allows viewers to take in a full view of the art.","Painting and sculpture are natural subjects for the camera. The camera has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details. What I’ve noticed, however, is that television still fails when it comes to these subjects. I’ve only seen one programme on television about art, on the subject of Salvador Dali. It was one of the more boring things I’ve ever seen on television. It began in a room in a house, with two women, a solitary boy and a young man sitting and looking out at the painting of a landscape. Then the solitary boy looked over at the painting and said: “Do you know it’s a picture of a tree, or is it a picture of a man?” The solitary boy replied: “It’s a picture of a woman with a lot of hair.” The solitary boy looked at the woman and said: “It’s a picture of a man with a lot of hair.” The solitary boy said: “It’s a picture of a woman. But is the woman a woman?” The solitary boy said: “It’s a picture of a man. But is the woman a woman?” The solitary boy replied: “Yes, she’s a woman. She’s a famous painter. You know? That would make her a good subject for a programme about art on television.” But the solitary boy said: “Sure. What’s the use of filming an artist who has no hair or clothes? I mean, he’s sitting and staring at his art; not making a film of it. He’s not even wearing a jacket. That’s because the solitary boy did not want to spend his precious time watching a documentary. So, he took out his smartphone and took a picture of a portrait of a young woman. It turned out to be a painting of a woman dressed in a coat and scarf. The artist looked at the picture and said, “Well, you don’t see the woman.” I said, “But you do see her face.” The solitary boy said, “Yes, but I don’t see her head.”","As a result, I have never seen a programme about art on TV since the mid-nineties and yet now I am writing this piece because I do remember watching the re-run of a series called The Secret Life of Walter Benjamin. As a kid, I remember being very fond of the television series based on the life of George Cleese and I remember the way this series made me rethink the art world. However, I have long since forgotten about the show. I wish it was still on. Now when I visit museums, I wonder about the history of art, but the programs I have seen seem to show a bit of everything. But when I go to the galleries, there is no time for any of the art to be shown. The only things that are shown are paintings and sculptures that I have already seen. When I visit the galleries in London, there is never any time for any art to be shown, the art is all in the exhibition guide. All that art can be seen is in the main section of the gallery. On the main gallery page, there are links to the website of the curator of the galleries, so I don’t have to go anywhere. It has to be said that all of the art shows I have seen this week have been atrocious. The first show was ‘Introduction to Andy Warhol’, which was the worst show I have seen so far this year. Every time I have watched it, I have been horrified at the over-use of the word ‘taste’. It was so trite that I became sick of it. Having seen several other shows, I knew what they were all about, but this particular piece really made me feel ill. What could possibly be the problem? A short piece about the history of art and the history of painting is a perfect example of what TV programming should be: showing the entire history of painting and giving viewers a sense of the time in which it was created. However, this only gets to show the first section of a picture, not the rest of the work. I feel very guilty about this programme. It was not really about the visual arts, it was purely there to sell a book or magazine. Why was it designed to make me think about art rather than about the history of the medium. Perhaps it should have been made into a film.","Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details. Instead of programmes about art there are endless videos, photos and programmes about sports which are entertaining to watch.","When I first saw this painting, I thought, it is beautiful. It is interesting that, in such a short piece, the artist has not shown that he or she studied art, for there may be a point to that, but there is no way to explain it and it isn't possible to present a series of detailed images in such a short space."
C2,"There are many reasons why actors might be subject to a lot of scrutiny. While you’re not going to get the same job twice, you can’t work on a play everyday. No two actors are the same so it’s natural to assume they’ll all work the same if a particular role comes up. While some actors will take a little while to get a feel for the character before they begin their training, others will jump in right off the bat. But you can do your best to get that feel for a character by making sure that you’re on the right page, or at least make sure you can easily recall things that have gone on in the past. For example, if you were to say that I should know every line of the script, I wouldn’t believe it. So you can imagine my glee when the director asked me to explain some of the dialogue. There’s usually a line that requires me to think about whether I can bring out the emotional aspect of the character or not, and whether I can bring the energy to the scene. Here are some of my tips to ensure that you’re on the right page for the part and that you can use every part of the script, not just the ones that you know are written for your part. Acting is a collaborative skill, so it’s important to listen to other actors. It’s not always easy to get a feel for how they think about certain things so it’s often a good idea to get some advice from other actors. Acting involves a lot of physical work – you’re walking, standing, bending, lifting, and moving yourself around on stage or on the screen. You have to practice so you can hone your skills. That is especially true in a technical capacity, so being prepared with your tools will come in handy. For example, I can use my voice box, which has a range of different pitches, to get a feel for how other actors speak to their characters. Or use my eyes to watch what they are saying. And you don’t have to do this on stage, there is some wonderful technology called tele-presence which allows you to put other actors’ actors and movements onto your own screen in real time. For me, the tele-presence has changed the way I approach my characters. Before being an actor, I never really took the time to watch television or movies, I only watched soaps or soap operas. But now I spend at least an hour a day watching television, and I’m not even an actor. Rather I’m watching someone else and I know who they are. I’m not pretending to be someone I’m not. I’m not trying to look like the real me. Whether it’s playing the villain in a soap opera or pretending to be an animal on television, you’ve got to understand who they are and where they come from, so that you can make sure that the character is the right one. So to be an actor is not just the same as being a writer or a musician or whatever. What I’m saying is that I think that it’s extremely important to know each other and to communicate as well as possible. It’s not the same as relying on a particular person to give you your lines. You’re not going to get to have the time to be with someone for every scene. Having a good working relationship with your fellow actor is as important as getting the best work. I’d never let a director in on anything I’m working on because he might ask me something like, “What do you mean you want to have an hour off tomorrow?” I don’t want to say to an actor “Oh no, I’m not coming on that way, I’m doing my usual thing.” I try to avoid saying anything that could be considered self-congratulatory because most people would not be willing to put themselves out there and say it. I often find that a good actor will let the actor tell the truth. I once knew an actor who was so excited and proud of himself in his first acting job that he wasn’t even willing to talk about it. He was so proud of himself that he didn’t even want to talk about himself. I once made an actor cry in the presence of other actors in a production. That is probably the worst thing an actor can do. It’s probably the best thing any actor can do. So if you have your heart in acting, the best thing you can do is to accept that it’s the only thing that matters.","...I can see a few things in your head and they’re right, but they’re not true. When I was in a play the part of a girl wasn’t anything like what I’m doing now....I feel so good being an actor, and then one day I realised it’s so much more than that. I’m an actor because I can play a character I’ve never known before. I can play this character over and over, and I can see what people think about me....Some people can’t see into me, and sometimes they feel like I don’t exist at all. I feel like I can’t be with people....And when I’m not an actor, it’s just me. I can’t feel other peoples’ emotions, because I’m not part of that feeling. I can’t express what my character is feeling, because I’m not a human being. And when I’m not an actor, there’s nothing else in this world that I can relate to. There’s nothing other than the people in front of me. I can’t connect with them. That’s why it’s so hard for me to find that connection with someone, and sometimes I’m not sure what they think about me. Maybe it’s how I feel, because when you are on stage and you’re really into the show it can feel a little surreal....And I can feel really bad about it sometimes, because sometimes I just want people to understand what I’m doing. In fact, I have this mental block about people judging me. I can’t do it. I don’t do it well. But if someone says to me I’m good, I can still feel like I’m not good enough. That I don’t have it. I can’t....But if someone says to me I’m not good enough, I can still feel like I’m not good enough. What does that mean? What if someone says I’m bad because someone said I’m bad? If they say I’m bad because someone said I’m bad, you can also feel like you’re not good enough. Why should someone in a position like me judge me?...And that makes me feel like I’m not good enough. But I’m good enough, and I feel like I’m great. So, it’s not the actors’ craft. It’s what they do for a living. But it’s not their craft. It’s what they eat, and the food they eat is often the food that makes them great. You’ve got the body, and a great head. It’s the acting. It’s not having a lot of money, having the right type of equipment, being able to pay their bills. It’s doing a job with no recognition. And so, when somebody says “Oh yeah, you’re an actor?” I’m not going to say “well, I’m one.” I’m not going to say “well, I’m not an actor.” I’m not going to say “but I can’t do that.” I’m not going to say “but I can”. In fact, I’m not going to say anything because my job, my livelihood, my life is everything, and it’s not even worth the name. It’s because I have this huge hunger and the hunger comes from a place inside. It’s the hunger and the hunger for recognition. So, it’s about being a professional in this industry. And that’s something you must really try to do. I feel like an actor is a tough job. The remuneration can be so steep, and the pressure so high that the job gets boring. The hours spent working have to be grueling, because you can’t work when you’re really sick. I’m sure there are other fields where people in similar positions feel that way. But it’s not the actors. It’s the companies. The theatre companies often force actors to do interviews where they’re asked what they do for their livelihoods. I mean it’s very obvious. This kind of work can be so hard, I feel like I should be giving a speech about my job, and not the actors. And yet, most actors are very good and successful because they know how to do this job. You never know if you’re going to be good or bad when you do it. I’m not sure I have a choice. I can be the","If I’d heard the voice of an actress who has worked in a film or a theatre company ask ‘why do you think your job is hard?’ then I would have thought, ‘because I’ve never been an actor’. But I know many actors who have had to endure the pressure and mediocrity of many roles. The pressure to give performances at a high standard and perform as if their craft was the most important thing, without even realising it. The pressure to show people they’re capable of something that they cannot, without giving them a great audition, is just one element of the pressure. The other is the fear of making a mistake. Even if the production organisers say to the actors that they’re doing their best, a mistake will always be made – not that any actress is perfect, but the fact that we are constantly reminded, by a multitude of people, that we are human.","A few weeks ago, I was interviewed by a journalist on my TV program and in a newspaper article. In my interview, the actress stated that most of the interviews with actors are either boring or inaccurate. The article included quotes from actors that I would not have thought to take to heart (or indeed, would have wanted to) unless they attributed the quotes to the actor himself. Some of those quotes were incorrect. For example, the words ""The Art of Acting"" are very similar to ""Talent"" (the title of a song by U2, if I recall correctly). However, an actor’s choice of word in the first sentence of an interview is not at all a personal choice. It’s actually the first word that comes to mind when an interviewer asks an actor a question. The question asks about the artist and the work. I, as an actor, am asked to do two things when being interviewed. First, I am asked if I am happy, and I then answer it. If the answer isn’t the former, then the question is not a good one. For example, an actor who was asked if he/she would “like” being an actor would not answer “Yes”, so how does that affect his/her work? A person in a field that is completely subjective and subjective is a person whose views on an artist's work are not necessarily the same as another artist. To answer the question without judging or judging, then an actor must accept that it’s not the actor’s job to judge others. The actor simply does not have the time or opportunity to do it. In a business that is constantly changing and evolving, actors often find that they don’t know how to respond to different audiences or different situations. To learn from other artists is a key aspect of acting and being an actor. I also believe that it is a person’s responsibility to know what it is they want and need. An actor is not the art of acting, they are the people that make acting art and what it is in art. Throughout history actors have been respected and admired for their creativity and ability. To me, actors are like painters, musicians, and sculptors. To learn about art, it takes practice. To understand the importance of art, one needs to look at the work of other artists. You can admire the work of a painter without appreciating their skill. You can see their craft but you cannot appreciate it. I am not an artist. I am an actor. I want to make art. As an actor, I respect the art, but don't appreciate myself.","A few months ago, I was talking to a client in my office and she was asking me about my experience in The Crucible. I remember thinking of how strange and surreal that role was; how I’d never been in one before and how much I’d enjoyed it. I grew up in the theater and had seen quite a few plays in my time, but I had never been in one. I wasn’t prepared for that. It wasn’t until I was in that role that I realized how terrifying it was, as it was that fate had brought my character to life. I started talking more about the role, how I had grown to love it and how the audience did too. At that point, that’s when the conversation started turning into a recitation of bits of Shakespeare that I knew and didn’t know. As we chatted, it became clear that I had never read a single line, but knew and understood the speech of a number of the actors in that room. I had read their lines, and could tell the difference between them and those of the actors I was talking to. And I realized that my own acting, my own utterances, had no effect on the audience. It wasn’t because of how great or clever they were (or even how famous) that I was interested in them, or because of the way I was expressing myself. I was just expressing my feelings about the things that were important to me. I was just feeling my feelings because this was a really big stage for me, and I had this intense desire to get into character and hammer the part out. And then, because I knew my part and understood it, I was able to make it my own. I am not sure about the rest of your story but I can tell you that I found this really interesting. This is definitely one of my favourite quotes I’ve ever read. What a great piece, A2! Great job! It is really beautiful, isn’t it? It really makes me think. Love the excerpts, they are such interesting tidbits of information. I would not have thought of that. Thanks for sharing!","“But why do actors dislike talking about themselves?”, one person asked another. “When I was in high school, I was really passionate about acting. As a matter of fact, I was very interested in pursuing an acting career,” the man replied. “Why do actors hate talking about themselves? When I was in college, I was really passionate about acting. As a matter of fact, I was very interested in pursuing an acting career. “Because as a matter of fact, I really love acting. As a matter of fact, I am one of the best actors in the world. So, when I was in college, I was really passionate about acting,” the man replied. In fact, “I was the best actor in the world,” the man replied. The only downside to this, of course, was that the man would have to agree to speak of himself when interviewed.","The acting craft is one of the most misunderstood and misunderstood of all the performing arts in recent times. The role of an actor has many levels and is a demanding one, but can also be extremely rewarding and is a wonderful way to express yourself. A good actor can make a great actor or a terrible actor. So, how do you decide to become an actor? When I first began acting I was ostracised from my friends for being a nerd and a loner; I think I’m just a normal person who loves to entertain people. To be a good actor you need to have a strong work ethic, passion and creativity. When we first met I knew I was going to be an actor, but I really didn’t. I was too apprehensive to pursue an acting career. I was not sure where I’d end up. I knew it was going to be my job, but I was scared it was going to be something totally unrelated to me. I had done some acting but was struggling with what it meant. I would think about acting for a long time but couldn’t really put my finger on it. But when I was told I had to be an actor, I had no idea how it would turn out. I was terrified that I wouldn’t be able to work as hard as I wanted. I was terrified because I didn’t think that I had the skills or abilities to do the things that I wanted to do. So, what did I do? It took a lot of experimenting on my part and trying things that I didn’t think I could do. I learned about different methods and techniques to make an interesting performance. I was able to find out which techniques made actors nervous and what methods made actors comfortable on stage. I was able to develop a better technique for delivering difficult and emotional dialogue. I was able to gain confidence and focus on what I needed to do rather than the way I was used to doing things. It wasn’t easy and, even now, I still struggle with it every day. That’s why it’s an art, not a science. Ultimately it’s just about the process. As an actor, you have to become a very good actor and a very good person in order to fulfill this job. The biggest thing that people don’t realize is that acting is a very specific art. Even if you love a film, the acting skills you have to develop will be different from the ones you will need when you are in a show. Your characters need you to be able to portray them as they are. That’s the most important thing to do. Actors need a lot of practice and experience to really become good actors. This is why acting is a very long term career, and can last up to 15 years. So, how do you do this? By continuing to work on your craft and improve yourself, as well as doing other things, such as doing theatre and auditioning. There is no magic formula for becoming an actor, but it’s something you have to work at, to work on yourself, to work on your craft and the people around you. I think the only thing that really helps actors to become good actors is their hard work. There’s a saying that you can’t be an actor without doing other things, and if you want to become an actor you need to learn to do other things first. By learning other people’s acting techniques and watching them utilise these techniques, and working with other people who do the same, you will become an actor. Just keep pushing your boundaries and you will get there. The acting career is no accident, it’s a conscious choice. And once you have decided on your own path, you just have to find the time and patience to make it happen. I am a very professional actor, and I have been since I was very young. I didn’t want to be just another actor. I wanted to work with a diverse variety of people. My life has changed. I am married now. My wife has a lot more time to spend with me. My daughter has a lot more time with her. I am a working actress who has worked in films and theatre since early twenties. As an actor you need to know the craft, the skills and the techniques of acting so you are able to be successful. As an actor you also need to know the technical aspects of acting. Doing the right things, the right way to take things from a scene to another and really understand the story. Be able to communicate with people of different backgrounds. Be able to talk"

What can the job of the future look like?,"In a nutshell, a few words are often enough to answer the question: Is your work truly appreciated? Theodore Zeldin believes that our work lives could change dramatically. He is currently a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and is the author of Theodore Zeldin and the Future of Work: How We Can Transform Ourselves and the World.","So, are we as respected and appreciated as we deserve? I guess we are not. Quite often I think he’s right. I mean, we have to change. I haven’t actually written about it yet, but it’s a very interesting concept he has got there. In a few words he talks about the re-evaluation of the professional world – it’s being re-evaluated all the time. There are some brilliant ideas on his website, including what he calls the ‘rethinking of professional standards,’ which involves re-thinking things, putting new thinking into practice, and re-evaluating the meaning and purpose of what we do. In some ways, it harks back to the ‘The Worker Experience’ campaign by David Cameron, where he proposed a new workplace, which included “personality coaching”, mentoring, professional development, learning, and social support. I think what Zeldin is advocating is an excellent idea. However, I do worry about some of these ideas being adopted. I don’t think the professional standards will be renegotiated. The job roles will have different meanings, but unless we do this change that will remain the way it is.","“Your life is a series of small choices,” says the author of the bestseller Do You Know What You Really Want in Life? “You don’t know until you try and don’t try.” The author looks back on his career and suggests the key to happiness—“Employers will soon have to ask themselves whether the work you do matters to the people around you,” he says. Work Theodore Zeldin.","A2 learners in the CEFR scale will appreciate the ideas, suggestions and arguments in this text about work, the working life and how it can change. Is success in a career now sufficient to earn you a respectable salary? It certainly seems so to my friend, the author Theodore Zeldin. “There are all sorts of reasons why people quit or leave their jobs and one of the most prevalent is that they find themselves unhappy in their work and often can’t work out why. “I have spoken to many workers who work very hard but have not been able to get ahead, they want to change their lifestyles and to find themselves happy again. “There are also people who feel that they’re working hard but do not actually get any satisfaction, they don’t get the money they’re entitled to, they are unhappy. Then there are people who have reached the top of their profession but they don’t realise that that’s because they didn’t get the right training. They don’t understand that they didn’t do it on purpose or because they were pushed to the top. They don’t understand that what they want is not necessarily the best career or job for them. There are others who simply cannot get their heads around how to change their lifestyles. People who are happy and fulfilled are rarely happy, no matter how big their salaries are. The most common reasons for this are that they are not happy at work. Theodore Zeldin is a business writer who writes in his spare time. He was asked to be part of a TEDx talk and he wrote about how he got into writing.","I was so excited when my boss told me that she would let me take more time off to get a better job. At first, it was a big deal, but then it became something I’ve been thinking about since. Zeldin tells us how things will change: A robot would come to your home, collect your stuff, and do all the jobs you do. They would provide you with a list of tasks that you could tackle — if you chose to do them. It would even be possible for you to work with machines to help you out with your work. That’s why the famous psychologist, theorist, and author Theodore Zeldin thinks that our working lives could change. What would you do?","I was thinking last night as I watched the news and wondered what the future of the work of many of my friends might be like. There were two people I thought stood out for their work ethic and I thought I knew them. The first was a teacher I know who was a wonderful teacher and an inspirational and inspiring role model to many. However, I knew it wasn't really true. It may be because she wasn't in this job, I thought, but because of her dedication and commitment to her students, she was well respected and appreciated in this job. The other person, was an engineer. After he retired I wondered if there might be a job in the future for this type of person. When I found one open I thought, 'Maybe I could do that!' I was right. An engineer working in a large multinational company came to me and said, 'Your job sounds great - do you want to join us?' And I said, 'Yes, please.' And that's what we decided to do. The first meeting I attended was to get to know the person and she explained what she did. As we went back and forth, I would tell her how much I loved working with her and how my working life had changed. I learned that she was very passionate about people and about how I could help them. My dream job would be to become an architect and to create a company that could provide every possible product that would solve the problems of today's world. I was excited when I started to feel that way. I worked for two years in a project-based school. When it came time to move on, I was shocked how much my job had changed. But that excitement did not last for long. As I continued to work I felt the same way. I knew that I had to do something to get ahead."

Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth, they will soon be exchanging words.","Two women sit at a dinner table, each with an entirely different accent. One says French and the other speaks German, the third speaks English. The woman in the French accent repeats the word ‘the’ each time her pronunciation differs from the English. By saying ‘the’ the woman says to the English person: This is how I know she speaks French. It is as if a switch were flipped in her brain. ‘No’ is a response she would give, if this were the case she would say “No, I don’t want to call her French.” The English person responds, ‘Yes. I also know that she speaks German.” The French person agrees, ‘Yes’, and the conversation progresses. The French person thinks for a second and replies, ‘I can’t, but I will later.’ The English person then says: This is fine. I just wanted to make sure I explained it correctly. The French person then repeats, ‘Yes, I can’t’. The English person repeats, ‘Yes, I can’t’, and they end their conversation. It was a long time after the French person said this, that the English person continued their conversation. She then pauses to listen to the conversation between the two women. The French person replies, ‘This too is fine.’ She then pauses for a moment. ‘No, I think I must say it now.’ She says, ‘Yes, please.’ She begins the exchange again, saying, ‘I’m sorry,’ and then finishes it. ‘Yes, please.’ The French person replies, ‘No, thank you. I will not repeat the French thing unless you do it again.’ She says it again, ‘Yes, please.’ Finally, the French person answers, ‘Yes, please.’ Once she has finished, she says, ‘Thank you.’ The French woman nods her head, and the conversation then continues. The French person says, ‘No, thank you. I will not repeat it.’ A few minutes later the French person said, ‘Thank you,’ and she replied, ‘We will say it again later.’ The French person looks at the English woman, and thinks, ‘Aren’t you referring to me as ‘the French person’?’ The French person nods, ‘Yes’, and then replies, ‘I am the French person.’ Once again the French person nods and the conversation resumes. The French woman hasn’t said a word since the first time they spoke, but the conversation keeps happening. One night in the early 1900s, during a war in Europe, the Frenchman found himself in a strange situation. He was sent to kill another war criminal, but instead he ended up getting to use a different language, French.","A boy named Ted is a linguistic scholar. He has been teaching grammar for ten years. It is clear to Ted that the linguistics of language are important for making sense of the world. His work suggests that we learn through experience. This makes sense, because in practice we experience things not using words but by watching them happen. He says, “The act of speaking produces a linguistic effect and affects the person reading it. In this case, the child is trying to understand what is written in a book.” Ted describes how language shapes our perceptions, and this is why our ability to communicate is so powerful. His students then asked what could be done to improve the quality of English. Ted cited a study of children who had learning difficulties - the study found that children who had language problems and had difficulty understanding instructions, also had greater difficulties understanding directions. “Adequate language skills are also important when you want to become a successful writer, whether you are an English teacher or not,” he said.",Language is so tightly woven into our human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it.

Some people learn from watching books and some through watching videos. You can learn new things from watching videos and reading books. Some people learn by hearing words and others through seeing things. This is one of my favorite things. When I was growing up in the sixties and seventies I had a lot of different interests but all the things that I had done all in one day were interesting to me. I would always look at things that I saw and read books, magazines and the television. Most of my childhood was spent in school but I always longed to be a journalist. When I was a young boy I played outside with my brothers but I cant say that I really ever got to do anything like that. My family always talked and I cant say that I ever really got to do anything like that. My favorite movie was Star Wars. My favorite thing about that movie was the way it made you feel like you were on another planet when you were in a room with aliens. It was an amazing movie and I remember when I first saw it I was so excited because I had a vision of what the future might be like. I dreamed that one day I would travel to another galaxy, and that I would be able to take something home that would make me happy. One day I will walk into the distant future and I will not only have the ability to create my own universe but also have an understanding that there are going to be other universes that are full of people that share my love of language.","A year ago two scientists visited the brain of a baby and tried to create speech with electrodes stuck on the babys head. They measured the brain activity when two groups of electrodes were implanted in the babes brains. One group was placed near the skull, while the other was placed in the ear. In both groups the brain activity increased when they used verbal commands. They then recorded data from both groups to see how the brain activity increased as the child spoke."
C2,"""This is an exhibition that has been a long time coming, one that carries a certain amount of weight... but it is absolutely delightful."" A kinetic artist's work from 1959, which has been featured in the first exhibition of kinetic art at the Hayward Gallery in London. The exhibition, which was curated by the Hayward's senior curator, Chris Marker, comprises the work of 35 British and international artists, some of whom have never been shown together before. The works include films, performances, sculptures and performances by artists such as Keith Haring, Mark Ryden, Frank Stella, Richard Serra, Joseph Beuys, Claude Monet, and Mark Ryden, as well as works by Italian and Russian artists. ""There is an undercurrent of movement throughout the collection, and the Hayward's history of acquiring, exploring and presenting artwork, which reflects the importance of the movement of objects in our lives, and also the many contributions of others who experimented with movement — whose works have gone unrecognised for so long,"" the exhibition states on its website. The exhibition, which ran at the gallery from 19 April to 18 September 2017, was founded by Haring in 2001 and focuses on artists whose works are defined by movement as opposed to the idea of sculpture. ""We want to show people how we viewed this type of art, or that kind of art,"" says Marker. ""And we're looking for artists who have a particular interest in kinetic art. These aren't artists who had some kind of a career in the 1940s or 1950s, or even 20s and 30s — these are artists who made it themselves."" By exploring the ideas behind some of the most popular kinetic works in British art history, the exhibition also examines how those artists engaged with their context and the objects in their work to create a new visual language,"" adds Marker. The exhibition also includes a number of new works by artists such as Richard Serra, Tony Cragg and David Hockney, who were inspired by the work of Claude Monet. ""Kinematic Art: A History of Movement"" features more than 60 works by artists who are known to be active in the kinetic art community. They are artists who have had an impact on the world, such as Chris Marker and Mark Ryden, who aspire to make an art practice that deals more with the world around us than with the artists who create the art itself. ""[Kinematic Art] is about bringing the work of artists, their work and how it's created, to the public in order to develop a wider dialogue about what kinetic art is and what its role is in the wider world,"" says the Hayward's head of contemporary art, Simon Parr. ""It’s an important period in the history of art because people are still interested in trying to think of how to make art,"" says Marker. ""That's why we have to consider how kinetic art has changed."" The exhibition runs at the Hayward Gallery until the end of October.","ARTISTS were rushing to capture the movement of everyday things. The idea of the abstract and purely mechanical appeared in the 1960s with artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, Arshile Gorky and Max Ernst. They could also incorporate light and sound into their creations as well as the viewer moving on a wall or sitting on a bench. Taking a broader view than the simple abstract, it was evident that there was a new era in art. In the last decades of the 20th century, sculptures, sculptures, sculptures. For kinetic art, it was all about motion and the simplest works of art were made to look like motion. The most famous piece of kinetic art is probably John Baldessari’s whirling piece, a snaking tower made of white steel trusses that jibs at incoming traffic. The artist himself uses a hammer and mallet to make a whirling mass of metal trusses, creating a sort of kinetic effect. A single, achromatic light bulb is suspended by an extension cord from a central column, creating a contrasting effect. Baldessari’s works aren’t as intricate or sophisticated as those of Morisot and René Magritte but they have the element of spectacle and fun. The most famous of the kinetic artists was Marcel Duchamp and he had a huge influence on the development of this kind of art. He created a lot of kinetic sculptures and one of the first was the work titled The Wind and the Sky which was on show at the Tate Modern in London.","The Hayward Gallery is being transformed into a place full of wonder by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. The exhibition, which opened last Thursday, is entitled ""Kinetic Art Rejoice"". This article was written by Mark Hodgson, an Englishman, for the Times.","As part of a major re-opening of the Hayward Gallery in London, the exhibition of moving images titled Kinetic Art: The Art of the Future is returning after six years in the UK and the USA. The exhibition is an impressive display of some 500 works from the last 60 years. From a wall of humming electric clocks to a piece from the 1960s by a British artist called Philip Guston, the exhibition gives new life to a previously overshadowed movement in modern art. There are also a number of fascinating new installations. Throughout the show, movement is central, whether it be from simple mechanical devices, to intricate robotic art installations. Some installations in the collection require movement such as the ‘Matrix’, a piece from a French artist from the 1940s which uses two spinning, electric motors and a kinetic wind turbine to send a stream of water across a room. Others, such as ‘Statics of the Mind’, feature the movements of the human body. The exhibition includes the world’s first video of an artist, Jean-Michel Basquiat, at work and highlights the impact of technology such as computers and satellites on artists of this era. Some of the works are quite complex or are made of metal which creates a powerful visual effect, such as Max Ernst’s lily flowers in the rain, pictured above.","The Hayward Gallery is a typical example of a London venue that owes its existence to the financial support of the British Establishment, says David Bates, a critic for the Independent on Sunday. In recent times, the venue has become a repository for controversial art, particularly political art, and on Sunday the most controversial installation – an exhibition on the history of the kinetic artist, the artist who, in 1958, revolutionised the way people interact with art – took center stage. This week, the Hayward has been spruiked up by a clever but simple exhibition of the kinetic artist, Ernst Mayer. Born in 1896 in Vienna, Mayer was born into a Jewish family in 1890 and has been fascinated with electricity ever since. He first developed an interest in electricity at age 9 when he created a huge dynamo to heat his home. Seeing the dynamo in action is a powerful emotional experience. At a time when the RAF’s bombers were threatening to attack London, he felt inspired to create a piece of kinetic art. But it was Mayer’s fear of electrical hazards – such as power outages – that inspired him to abandon this path. His kinetic sculpture, called “Telephone Box” (1950), has become one of the most iconic and influential pieces in kinetic art. It is based on an old-fashioned phone box which he took apart and reassembled into its original form. The sculpture then comes to life as the electric current travels through the box, revealing a huge number of lights and a series of pulsating speakers. In addition to the electric components, the gallery has several other works, including a set of kinetic glass panels from an Austrian artist who, in 1962, won the prestigious Monet prize for his kinetic painting of an octopus, the crowbar and a large, movable glass globe. On a different level are works by sculptors Paul Klee, Max Ernst and Thomas Hirschhorn, who, among other things, used wind to turn glass to marble, and an interactive sculpture by German abstract painter Paul Klee. The pieces on show include some pieces that are as abstract in their creation as they are in their physical movements. The first is a glass case containing a three-dimensional revolving sculpture titled “Dead Sea Scrolls (1973)”. It is made of glass and metal and consists of a sculpture of a figurative seascape that reverberates. It is shown rotating, and the work is actually a model of the Greek columned ship Athena. The second part of the exhibition focuses on other kinetic works, including a sculpture by the late sculptor and teacher Carlo Scarpa. This is a small sculpture of a moving box that is stuffed with thousands of marbles arranged into a spiral and whose movements seem to reverberate around the gallery.","The Hayward Gallery is in the process of organising a kinetic art exhibition. “A world of movement, not so much colour and pattern as pulsing colour, movement and action,” says Jonathan Eades, the Gallery’s director, in a statement. “The exhibition highlights the importance of movement and space in art, and demonstrates that some of the great art of the twentieth century uses these ideas to a great effect.” The exhibition runs until 31 March.","KA: THE SEARCH FOR MOTION is a dazzling new exhibition at London’s Hayward Gallery, which is opening to the public on Monday (11 April). Organized by the kinetic art association KIN (Kinetic International,) the exhibition examines the history of movement art in the twentieth century and features installations from a number of artists. The exhibition will be on display until 9 March, at which point it will move to the Art Institute of Chicago and New York City."
C2,"David Bowie’s influence was not primarily youth cult but his lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies. But that’s not how it seemed. That ominous picture of Neil Young’s acoustic guitar that hung on the wall in the old hotel lounge was a bit distorted to me, even as I drank the draught beer. Paul Simon’s first release in America in 1956 was “Romeo and Juliet”. This single went through several incarnations, but the original, from 1956, is the one that we remember. The album was never released but it does appear that the label was unable to produce it because a pressing error occurred and had to be re-issued. In this case, the record was produced by EMI, which owned the rights to the original recordings.",My dad always played rock and roll in the car. When he was younger he would play the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and he would play the Beatles and the Rolling Stones’ songs. I remember listening to a lot of rock and roll in my younger years. I played it when I was at school and when I was in the Navy. I played it when I was working and when I was at home. I also played it when I was in trouble and when I was in trouble. I used to tell my dad he needed to listen to the Beatles and Rolling Stones whenever he would get in trouble. When I was home from school and I was bored I would play them on the radio for people to listen to. It was a good excuse for me to listen to other music too and when I was at home watching movies. One day my dad played some old rock and roll and he started dancing. My dad laughed and said that was my favorite part. When I was in school I would play the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and I also played the Beatles and Rolling Stones’ songs. I always played the Beatles and Rolling Stones’ songs when I was playing sports because I would play them for my friends. When I was in college I played the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and I also played the Beatles and Rolling Stones’ songs. I used to play the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and I also played the Beatles and Rolling Stones’ songs. I made up some songs about some baseball players I had played with when I was younger and they wore baseball caps. My dad loved when my dad played the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and I played the Beatles and Rolling Stones’ songs. Paul Simon is a young man in his twenties and he loves rock and roll. He is also the son of a rock and roll singer. I also like to play some old rock and roll.,"Paul Simon had always been a keen rock fan. His father had been a singer in the Beatles. But it wasn’t until after the Beatles had split up that he became really interested in it. He bought his first record in 1961 at a record store in Liverpool. After the first week, his friend’s wife gave him the record as a gift and they went out to buy a copy. The only problem was, Paul didn’t like it at all. His father was a man who, when asked for his opinion, would never speak to anyone who wasn’t his best friend. The other day, he was on the phone to his dad to make an arrangement. In the message, Paul tried to explain his theory, referring to rock and roll as a “fraternity of young boys who got to make music and didn’t have to go to university”.","Paul Simon remembers the summer of 1956. It was a warm, sunny day. On the front porch of the house, there stood a large, wooden rocking chair that had been passed on to him from his mother. The rocking chair was made of ebony wood and had a thick, sturdy back. Its long, dangly, golden-brown upholstered seat was covered with a large floral-embroidered throw that hung over the front seat. The floor of the chair was smooth, and the entire piece rested atop a large round, dark-gray ottoman. The chair was also covered with beautiful flowers. The flowers adorned the chair with large floral-encrusted balls. These flowers were the harbingers of a happier future for the young man and the woman who loved him. Paul Simon had always wanted to marry the lady of his dreams but his mother, a wealthy, white woman, thought he was too young for that. As he sat on the stool, reading the newspaper, the words were echoed back to him: ""I have to admit that if I had to choose between you and the woman of your dreams, I would never choose you."" Paul Simon looked at his father with a smile and a twinkle in his eye, and then began to tell his mother, ""I gotta go. I don't want to get married or get married again. I gotta let it go.""","Paul Simon said that rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged, as well as the next generation of rock idols who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange unsettling sound would somehow irrevocably be linked with their destinies.","Paul Simon was one of many musicians who embraced the psychedelic sounds of the 1950s. He wrote songs like “Heartbreaker,” “The Houses of Our Fathers” and “Tutti Frutti.” He later became known for the albums he produced for the Beatles, The Who, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, John Lennon and the Rolling Stones.","Paul Simon was born in 1931 in England. He had become aware of music as a teenager while being in the military. When he was nine, he met Robert Johnson and later that year became one of the first members of the rock and roll band The Beatles. In 1959 he began his music career with the group The Everly Brothers. The Everly Brothers were a young blues band that included Johnny Cash."
C2,"Poetry, in this, the era of our lifetimes, can be said to be the most highly stylized genre in the English language. Its purpose is to make sense of what is often viewed as the wildness of the human condition, to allow readers to understand the world of others in new ways. It also attempts to offer the reader the opportunity to have their feelings interpreted and their imagination stimulated. The subject of literary criticism is not the only field, of course, as it encompasses the art of writing itself as well as the study of society and the social conditions of its time. I know it is an inherently political and controversial subject, though the fact that in the last century the subject has become a great deal more social, a matter of great debate, has contributed to its popularity. It is also a highly individual art, which requires a certain degree of subjective interpretation and, from time to time, the interpretation of other people. For all the difficulties and complications of writing, I find it a very fascinating and pleasurable endeavor. The only issue with this type of writing is the fact that so many writers have had to face a host of difficulties to be able to publish. It is very often a matter of self-censorship. Some writers are unable to see the literary value in writing in a way that makes sense. I have a hard time understanding why some of these writers can be so popular, and others are so out-of-touch with reality. For instance, while I agree with the argument that James Joyce is a great writer, I don’t think it is his poetic voice that is the most distinctive feature of his writing. There are also other considerations that contribute to Joyce’s success. Perhaps the greatest of all is his unique style. He had a distinct voice, and he produced a form that was at that time highly innovative. There is also the fact that while there is a vast difference between the sound of the page, which is typically called stanza meter, and the spoken word of the audience, it is the voice of the author that explains why his books are popular. In other words, when you talk to the poet you are eliciting his natural voice; as it is written in verse and not in prose, he uses the language with all its subtleties and nuance. If the voice is not well positioned within the poem it will be difficult to understand the meaning. What is striking about Joyce’s style is that he used a language that sounded as though the speaker was expressing feelings he could not put into words. However, even that was not always the case. Poets may talk about figurative language, but the language used in poetry can be more formal or more free, depending on how much freer you want to be. While reading his work, you are sucked into a world of rich imagery, intricacies, and rhythms that is as different from what you were used to and not the other way around. Poets sometimes express feelings that seem paradoxical, or you might say that a certain poem is confusing and even contradictory. However, it is this lack of clarity in his words that keeps the poem from being confusing, and it is this inconsistency that allows it to remain clear.","At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. A poem written in the nineteenth century was called, ""The Death of Jane Austen.""","I was sat around a large table and as the table turned to show the names, I looked at the names. I recognized the names of the writers. It wasn’t until I looked at the names of the poets that I was able to spot the names of the authors. The names of all the poets were listed by their literary reputation. To me, these names are all very important and I hope that they will become a source of inspiration to future generations.","Whenever a child grows up, his or her own poetry will be judged by who he is. The author will be judged on the quality of his or her work, as well as the quantity and quality of his or her letters. Only the author will be judged on the quality of the verse. Unlike a rat that is scavenger, a poet is not afraid to challenge the rules of the game. It is in fact, not that they are naive, but that they do not accept them; if they do, they will be punished. All this is to say, one can not be a true poet without being a good reader.","A time when you are living through it and it's the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. A time when your grandparents are reading all your poems. The last time you went to the cinema to see a film was many, many years ago, but the last time you read the plays was on Saturday or Sunday night. The last time you got to see your favourite poet perform was on Sunday. You had been so busy that you forgot that there's not so much in between. If anything, you feel as if you are missing out on something very important to you. For more on the poetry of famous people, see Poems For The Retrospective View.",pity the poets who are dead...,"'Poetry Recitals' describes some of the poetry, and critics, and people of that particular era.

C2,"The screams of a small baby is a primal language that is uniquely the human language. And the crying is a sign of vulnerability. A baby screams because it hears the crying voice and recognizes what it is saying. To me, the cry is an expression of helplessness, not of an emotion. When I had to cry as a child for no apparent reason, it didn’t matter what I was crying about. The crying was what I was crying about.","The tears of a baby are different from those of an adult because they are not produced in response to a feeling of pain. A baby may cry because she needs to be comforted or because of a situation that is important to her. Some people may cry to show affection, while others cry for health reasons, according to the American Society for Pediatrics. Why we cry - as adults, we feel helpless sometimes, so that our emotions are not completely expressed in other ways, says David L. Clark, a child psychologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and one of the co-authors of the study, which appears in the journal Developmental Psychology. ""Crying helps 'express emotion,'"" says Clark, who studied crying in babies and young children and then went on to study how to treat babies with special needs. For example, he found that babies cry when they are upset over a new toy, and they cry when they are sad when someone is hurting them. Researchers also found that crying has a special purpose for babies whose mothers are unable to bond with them. ""Tears from a baby represent the feeling that a mother can no longer do a job for the child, and it is an important way for babies to communicate a need for comfort and protection."" Other benefits include giving babies a ""believing, comforting, protective mother."" They believe that crying will help them overcome problems such as learning disability, a speech disorder, and anxiety. They say that they are helping their babies learn how to cooperate with their parents and their peers, and that the more they cry, the closer their attachment to their mothers grows.","SURRENDER The earliest evidence for the earliest forms of emotional expression appears in the earliest forms of symphony music. This music varies in structure, rhythm, and the moods it inspires in listeners. The sound of symphony music, including its first notes, reflects a deep-seated emotion of longing and loss, and the emotional responses people feel when they hear these sounds. A symphony is therefore a concert devoted to the expressive and symbolic use of music. This is important because the very structure and expression of a symphony are essential to the symphonic experience. However, there are many aspects of this aspect of a symphony that go unexplored. Most of this remains unknown. To understand the role that symphonies play in forming emotional connection and emotional expression in humans, one must first understand the physics of the symphonic sound and how it is created. The earliest recordings of symphonies rely on the physical properties of the sound source. The sound of a symphony is therefore based on the wavelengths of sound waves. By following this pattern, one can use this information to determine whether a specific sound is being produced by the symphony or some other source. In the study, researchers recorded the waveforms of a symphony for eight hours at three different temperature ranges. The spectrum of waveforms was shifted each time the frequency of the sound change.","Blessings if I may express this: A man in the park, when he has finished playing basketball for a little while, suddenly stopped. ""Crying?"" he asked, his eyes still covered in tears. The boy had to stop what he was doing. He was playing with his brother. The father, as expected, said he was sorry. Then he began to cry again. ""Why are you crying? Where's your brother?"" he asked again. ""I'm crying because he lost his baseball game."" The father began to cry again. He was trying to find a better way to reassure his son. The father looked into the sun, as if to see if he could make it stop. ""I'm not going to stop now,"" he said, looking back at the boy. ""I'm not going to give up."" The boy did not want to stop crying and he sighed deeply. ""Maybe I can get him to stop crying,"" said the father, raising his hand. ""But if you have other ideas please feel free to talk about them."" The boy's father looked at him with a smile and said, ""You just can't get this kid to stop.""",Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolutionary purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears at least during childhood are mainly an expression of helplessness.,"Until now, scientists have largely thought of crying as the result of some kind of biologically driven process, such as a need for warmth, for comfort, or for protection. Some people argue that crying isn't natural, so perhaps it is a product of the social culture we've come from. Others believe that if a person can't cry he can't be happy, that there is some kind of biological mechanism preventing him from having a happy life.",CRYING Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolutionary purpose.

C2,"It’s all well and good sharing my day, telling friends and family the same, or the most basic of details about my life, but I still feel like I need to protect my anonymity. I feel like I’m revealing too much of my identity to the entire world, and that means that even if I get the opportunity to hide what I’ve been up to, that’s it. It’s not that I don’t need privacy in my life, or that I need to keep the world at arm’s length – that’s an entirely different story. I also feel that I should be mindful of the kind of person that I am sharing details with. I can’t believe all the stories I’ve been told and I haven’t been able to figure out who is speaking to me, I feel like my life is being taken advantage of, and that the public – especially celebrities and actors – have been able to find me. I am now ashamed to tell anyone that I’ve ever had to go to jail to protect myself, so to speak. The same goes for my daughter, she is a very private individual and I worry about her safety, but in a way, I’m glad I shared the story with the world. Now, I think I need to go back and think about it. Will I ever regret telling people that I’ve been in trouble? Or will I still feel comfortable doing it, even if it can be awkward?","Having just had a visit from a local police station, my family decided to blog about their recent trip. It was more like reporting on a special day than it was about my everyday life, and the result was pretty fun for me to write. The best part was the way my family got to see how they would behave in a real emergency. I hope that you can imagine what we did in the city centre in those moments! We had a police van, some police officers and some police officers riding around in a circle. We passed a cab that would take us to a hospital. We had a small accident outside the hospital. We were on our way to a birthday party when the cab driver got into a fight with someone and injured them badly. He was then arrested. He was sent to a police station where he spent two weeks until he was released on bail. We were all together on our knees, with everyone trying to be there as well, but there was no police officer there. They couldn’t get a decent picture of him and he was still bleeding from the neck after three days. We were so upset and angry! The police called the police, and sent them to our local police station. They gave us the facts about the incident, stating that they had only seen a photo of him in a newspaper at a club. There is an incident where there were ten cops and 10 robbers on the streets of St Georges Terrace. They also found a video of them being arrested and in detention. The footage lasted for more than 20 minutes and was seen on YouTube by many people.","A man came to my house and asked if he could go to my place, and he told me that he used to check me in. It seemed to me that in telling others that you were going somewhere, you were giving that person a greater chance of making contact with you. I think there are two main problems with this situation: people can see where you are going. If someone does see your whereabouts, that person is more likely to be interested in you. If the person does come to you, they won’t ask about work or school or anything personal, and it will be quite unlikely that they will try to get hold of you. As for my case, I am using Facebook, but not checking in, and so am not letting anyone know exactly where I am. I know that some people will make contact with me. But a lot of my contact is through email, or social media, where I’m more anonymous. I can also use websites such as Foursquare, which allows you to be physically present at a place you may not even be using yourself. I don’t like the idea of revealing my physical location. Maybe I just feel it would be a bad thing to do. So I’ve decided against posting a public whereabouts on my blog. I will always use the Facebook option.","A website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your whereabouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. What is a ‘check-in’? It is an online, instant message or post that allows you to confirm your presence or presences at a particular location (on a website, phone app, or in person). It is considered to be a digital signature (like a credit card imprint) confirming the fact that a person is present at a certain location on a particular date. This identifies you and makes it easier for someone to find you, assuming you are still there (and hence, not at a different location) if they were searching for you. A lot of these public check-ins involving travel are in fact part of what is called the ‘social sharing’ economy. If someone is there and shares that fact on a social networking website, they get paid for it. It is sometimes called sharing the ride. But it is not the only form of sharing. Sharing photographs and videos is also a form of sharing. For example, if someone is using a website like Instagram, they can post pictures of themselves at a certain location, and it would then be possible for them to check in to the location when they saw it. Some people also include photos and videos in status updates or status messages (as if you are actually posting the pictures or video to the social networking site). This is called sharing content to ‘post’ on a network, and is also called sharing for sharing’. So, if you check in to a location, the location is also publicly shared. Hence sharing content on a network is really ‘sharing’ and public sharing is essentially sharing content to the world. Blogging has become increasingly popular in recent years, with a lot of people sharing details of their lives. It is not entirely surprising that the internet has grown more popular. A recent survey of US adults by the BBC reported that a third of US adults owned a blog. However, the use of this website has been declining over the last few years, according to a survey published by Statista. According to the survey, almost 40% of U.S. adults would no longer use a blog if they could not find it. When was the last time you checked in at a place? What is a check-in? A check-in is a public message posted on social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter. Check-ins are also included in the social networking services such as Twitter, where they provide a means of keeping up-to-date with the location of people you have met (or are planning to meet). People often check-in while out for some casual fun, as it makes it more fun for people to see their online profiles. But these check-ins also increase the amount of information that people can see about you. For example, it is now common for people to include pictures of their physical appearance on their Facebook profile – an example of a “selfie” picture – to give a more accurate impression of their appearance and personal life. If you check-in to a restaurant, you will often see an image of your face next to the name of the restaurant. If someone is using a social networking site to plan or look for a place to eat, you might see photos of the restaurant along with your name and the time of day. While the use of a check-in is a social and marketing tool, it is important that people respect privacy when posting photos and videos on the network. You don’t want people to be able to track you down and make out your true identity without your knowledge.","One of the problems with social media is that we are all in the same social group. For example, if you go to a particular restaurant at lunchtime and somebody else from the group goes and buys a drink, you probably will see them at the bar. We don’t necessarily know whether the person from the group has taken a drink. So, if someone sees you drinking with a friend and thinks ‘Oh yeah, we must have met before – I didn’t check-in at the restaurant, do you think I’d go and buy a drink?’ he says. If he sees you in the bar and doesn’t think you’re a nice person, he might take a drink. When we meet for coffee in the café, it’s often the first time I have seen someone there after checking-in online. It’s a good way to get to know people and let them know you’re there. However, it’s not always the best idea to post details about what you have done or what your plans are during the day. Your whereabouts also might become known by friends, who may ask you if you have been at their place – then you may be unable to talk to them.","I often check social media sites when I leave the house to see if they are on. Sometimes I look at someone’s blog or website and I think, oh, I wish I could do this. Well, not so fast! My wife checks it. I like how the story ends.","A blog is a personal blog written for publication. In a blog you can post pictures, stories, ideas, quotes, comments on the world and your life as a whole. The blog can be written in any language and with different themes."
C2,"On the occasion of our holiday in Scotland I thought I would share with you a recipe for roasted carrots. In order to do this, all you need are carrots, onions and garlic. The carrots were cut into wedges, the onion sliced across the middle of each wedge and the garlic cut in half. Once you have prepared and heated the carrots, you then need to boil them. You want them to be really soft as the cooking time will be quite long. Once that is done, you take a large piece of bacon and put it on a pan which you need to heat and then put the garlic in the pan, then the onions. Once that is done, you now need to pour some of the meat juices from the lamb into a jug. Add the wine, the brandy and the salt and pepper to the pan and allow it to simmer for a few minutes. This is the cheapest and easiest way to eat roasted carrots. You need to prepare the carrots, onions and garlic in this way, so they are ready when you want to serve them. Add some cream, the brown sugar and a splash of brandy to taste. After allowing the mixture to simmer for a few minutes, you need to remove it from the heat and serve. The carrots will be tender when done, but they will still keep for a few days. For a different flavour try the roasted carrots. There are different kinds of sweetcorn. One variety is called “hotcorn” because it has a hot smell. Another is known as “hot cherry”. Hotcorn is a small crimson star-shaped fruit, and it is also one of the easiest vegetables to roast. You can have it cooked as is, or bake it. If you use the crimson star, you may find it easier to grill or bake it. If you use an oven, it is not necessary to roast it. You can just bake it like you would any other squash. I hope you enjoy this article, and don’t forget to share with your friends and followers.","As I sat down to write this, a food craving struck me. It wasn't the food itself but the fact that I liked the idea of eating it. Now I have a cookbook full of ideas for delicious food, but something that is particularly striking is the way that people go around thinking that they don't like food. This is a big mistake. When you are hungry, you feel hungry. When you are hungry, you eat. And, as this little story suggests, it is often a combination of different flavours.","There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one, but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting.","When I started this column I had no idea what it meant, it could have come from a book or a poem, but I had a feeling I would write it as my own personal experiences describing what I enjoyed about food. What about you? In what ways have your relationships with food changed as you have learned and understood more about it?","So I have a little book of recipes and I will teach you how to cook different things so that you can eat a variety of different foods and that your stomach will never complain. All of these recipes are from around the world, so they are not just from one country. They are my personal interpretation of what I consider to be real and healthy food. I have been making these dishes for over ten years now. They are very easy to prepare. You just need a few basic ingredients: olive oil and butter, chicken (I use chicken breasts but turkey is also good) onion, garlic and leeks, peas, olive oil (they are all natural and free of salt), parsley, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper, and whatever else is available. But there are many other things you can use. 1. If you have a large bowl, mix all the ingredients together. 2. Cut some fresh tomatoes into half inch (2.5 cm) pieces and a carrot in half inch (2 cm) pieces. 3. Fill the bowl with cold water and pour out the strained tomato liquid in the bowl. 4. Pour in the vinegar, and stir the contents with a fork. 5. Mix the pasta into the tomato liquid with your hands, and spread it out on to a baking sheet. 6. Put the stuffed peppers in the oven. 7. Bake the peppers for 20 minutes or until the cheese starts to melt. 8. Serve. 10. Mix the vinegar into the bread. 11. Add the chicken and mix gently. 12. Serve with green salad or bread and butter. 13. You will never be able to eat a single bite of chicken again. 14. Cook the chicken using only the basic method. 15. Cook for one and a half hours. 16. Do it one and a half hours. 17. Prepare the meat.","Food has always been a part of my life. I think it's a lot harder to feel good about something if you can't eat it. For example, I can't eat steak, pork chops or a burger because they have been cooked and I have to put them in the fridge. But if I prepare food that has been cooked and is eaten, I feel more like I have been able to do something important for myself. That's not to say it's always easy or that I always get it right. Trying new food or cooking something new are great examples of new experiences that can teach me new things and I can share these experiences with others too. I love being able to help people and make them feel good about themselves. If you want to learn more about food, go to the library or try a cooking class.","Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one, but so often we imagine that unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish it is hardly worth attempting. It’s true if we can cook for a special occasion it will be much more enjoyable, and we needn’t even bother thinking about special ingredients and difficult preparations. Rather, when it isn’t special we are just normal. We can’t help it, I suppose. There is nothing wrong with that, but let’s be honest, it is also far more time-consuming and frustrating. So why not eat a nutritious meal, in the comfort of our own home. Then perhaps we can focus more on the pleasures of food and make our relationship with it all the more fulfilling."
C2,"It wasn't just that I wanted to be a chef: I wanted to help cook. A young woman walked into the restaurant. I said hello and she asked me where I was from and if I wanted a job. ""I'm French"". ""Yeah."" She smiled. ""You're French?"" she asked. I replied."" I love cooking"". She was shocked. ""Yes,"" I replied. ""I'm Italian."" She smiled back and looked back at me. ""I'm a real Italian.""","After university I got a job with a small family run business in the heart of downtown Birmingham. The job was not that prestigious but it was the only job I knew of where the working hours were not so long. During this time I met a nice girl, a very quiet girl, and it turned out to be a very happy decision for me.","As I sat down on my chair in the dining room, I started to think about this dream I had long since had. It was not unusual for some people to pursue a career in the kitchen. Some people took degrees or left school to be doctors, lawyers, mathematicians or engineers. And yet there were many people who grew up and came to do these jobs. I know that I was one of those people. I had made a choice early on. After my years studying, when I enrolled at university, I knew I wanted to work for a big restaurant chain as a chef. Its manager was a big celebrity chef. His name was Gordon Ramsay. He worked with some of the top chefs in the world and was a respected figure. I found this kind of fame exciting. But I found myself having a hard time fitting the lifestyle into my undergraduate programme. The study demanded a lot of unsociable hours. My friends and I thought we were not prepared for the strain. So it was not something that appealed. I remember sitting in the kitchen, preparing dinner, when my friend mentioned that Gordon Ramsay was a good chef. I was stunned. He seemed like he had been at some of the best restaurants in the world. I was interested. He had a young daughter, whom I would later marry. I had also been working with Gordon, and when we got married I came to cook for him. During my first three years as a chef I gained a lot of experience. I learned a lot about making dishes. And so, even though it was not a very lucrative job, I had made friends. I got a taste of a much more glamorous life. I liked being the boss of my own restaurant. We had plenty of room to work together and be creative. And I liked working with my hands. And as the years passed I got the privilege of cooking for a group of people who he respected. One day, I had one guest in the dining room who I knew only through the television programme of Gordon Ramsay. Luckily, Gordon knew the show and knew the people involved in his restaurant. He had been a chef for many years and had enjoyed the glamour of his career. He had worked with some of the best chefs in the world and knew what he was talking about. He had met one of my friends from my college and knew all about Gordon Ramsay. He would sometimes surprise me with his cooking and tell me that someday I would be a chef too. And I was so proud of myself. I wanted to cook for him every night and make him feel special. So, I got some cooking lessons. My first lesson was very basic, but it helped me learn how to work with ingredients. I had no idea what I was doing, but he showed me the basic techniques for making a good meal. The food was so delicious that I could not wait to get back to the kitchen and cook another dish. My first two dishes at night were a chicken ragu with vegetables and risotto, and a fish risotto with lemon juice, tomatoes, clams and mussels. At midnight I boiled a large batch of pasta and a litre of stock. That night I baked my own chocolate brownie. I learned to make biscuits and churros from scratch. Later, I learnt to make tarts with fresh pastry. When my guests arrived for dinner I sat down to make them cakes. But I was disappointed that my guests did not really like them. I had put all my energy into cooking them, so it seemed strange that they seemed to enjoy them. The meal was over and I had to go home. But I loved my new job. My wife and I stayed up until dawn to watch our two sons' football match. Our oldest, Nathan, is now a football manager and a successful chef. He is also the owner of a pub restaurant called The Corner. He is very proud of his new role as a chef. He was pleased and proud that I had chosen him.","In fact, there were many things in life that I disliked, but cooking was the one I loved the most. I think it has something to do with the fact that it requires patience and passion. Most people in the world cannot keep at a job for more than a few hours. However, the love of food can make all the difference in the world.",I was in the third-year medical school. I was in the sixth year medical school. I was in the seventh year medical school.,"In order to have a taste of life as a chef, I had to work in a posh restaurant in a famous city. I was hired by a restaurant with a reputation for excellent cooking. After only four months in the kitchen, the restaurant was a success. The restaurant opened in time for our first dinner party. Sadly, however, the restaurant closed shortly after dinner. I would never want to work there again.","The Lure of the Kitchen When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is on the face of it an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long pressured menial - and badly paid. I knew when I was 17 that I wanted to be a chef. At that time, university tuition was £20 a week. In those days, college tuition was £20 a week. Today, that figure is over £20,000. If I had stayed at university, I would have been able to afford university fees in full and pursue my dream of being a chef. Unfortunately, a lack of money had made my choice of university the only option available to me. By then, my parents had agreed that I would have to work part-time. I was unsure, though, how the work would be done. I did some cooking at home on my father's farm, but that was not enough. Moreover, the cheapest hotel I could find was located in a quaint little village in rural Cornwall. It was a run-down inn, and as I had already worked at home before on the farm, I knew it was likely to be less expensive to run, even if the hotel was in a very remote place. However, I had no money, and even when I found a job as a waiter, I was unable to afford to live there. I realised that I would not be able to afford to take on the role of head cook, so I did not enrol in a two-year cooking course. Instead, I decided that I would work in my mother's restaurant as a cook, and then move to a posh hotel in the countryside to run the restaurant full-time. I was happy with my choice, for I had a job I loved, and I was going to enjoy it."
C2,"My companion was quite clearly a man of considerable means and one in whom I could trust quite a bit. Then again it was a person who had been able to get around – a person who, it seemed, was prepared to risk anything at all for the opportunity to benefit other people. It wasn’t as though they had been hiding their wealth for fear of punishment. They had come from a very different society. It was certainly not at all clear what he owed them or how he would repay his debts. I could only guess, based on the way the conversation progressed. One thing which struck me a little in the conversation was that he was not really a very observant man. The conversation was skewed more towards the political and the religious than in any other direction. The younger man, it turned out, did not understand the concept of an overarching political order – he did not appear to be a supporter of such things. His only knowledge of history or literature consisted of reading newspaper articles about past events. He could not speak of the actual past. He could not cite a surviving document. As a result he could not quote any passages from the Bible. He had not taken a course in grammar either. I knew this because I had read a short account in the Guardian in which a man explained his reasoning behind his over-reliance on the Bible, in a way in which it was the primary source and that he relied upon it. But, by saying that he relied on the Bible he showed that he was unable to remember or understand the Bible without it. To understand why he was so determined to have the Bible in a modern language the young man had to understand that the Bible could only be understood in a way that he could understand. He saw this as an opportunity to do so. He also saw it as an opportunity to have the Bible translated into a modern language and for the English language to be written in. These things were very important to him. It was very important because he needed to show that he understood the Bible and could use it for an English-speaking audience. He had always said that he had always felt that he could help the modern world out by improving how people thought about the Bible. For example, if you didn’t believe the Bible or that it was the only authority for life, then you could always find another religion and live your life. However, there was one thing that stood out to him as very strange – he thought that it was important to learn the Bible for every possible occasion, in order to be able to understand all ages and all situations. This he found strange indeed but it was what he saw as a gift. This was what his grandfather had always told him but he was now saying about himself. He saw it as a challenge.",Tim Rice sat in front of a mirror. He looked around with interest. His friends were still sitting with their eyes on the prize. “That’s a good question. Is the contest still open?” “You bet!” said the younger brother.,The eldest daughter asked me what the problem was. I told her about the cat and the cat would come out when she wanted to but the poor thing was not so sure. She paused a moment and then said: “What is that?” I laughed.,TIM RICE a jolly obnoxious youth of seventeen. he was quite unsuitable for the job. he was a bit of a bore in his own room. he seemed bored and a bit obnoxious as well. so he didn't get the job. he never pushed anyone else's opinions on me. he kept telling me how nice it was to spend time with me. I would like a job like that because it means my friends wouldn't think I'm in the wrong place.,"A man in the country town of Luton, England was having lunch with a business associate when he decided that it was worth having him for a chat. The young man seemed to enjoy it, so the two of them talked a little more openly than they had in the past. This is how the conversation went: They talked of how his father had been killed. He talked about his own relationship with his mother. They told of his father’s friendship with a Russian prostitute. He told of a time when he had visited a small town where everyone worked in a factory. The young man said the business associate in question was quite a good man, but he also knew about the trouble he had caused with the Russian prostitute. They also had a chat about a local gang that had made a lot of money and about how many children he had gotten pregnant. The two young men then discussed how the business had gone from strength to strength during the past few years. They reflected on the successes and failures of their business. It was a really interesting discussion. One of the young man’s brothers said that the business was a great success and he said that the family now had more than enough money. The next day he was asked to come in and he declined. He said he was just taking a break, and if the business was going so well in the future he would be willing to come in to keep it going. I had no idea what he would think. TIM RICE","A young man in his twenties was in his parlour, his coat fluttering off his chest — his head turning involuntarily with the slightest strain. His hair was not in a neat bun, the face was swollen with sweat and red hair was combed through with a shaver. A glass of cold beer was awaiting him beside a large crystal vase with four matching spoons. Behind him there sat another glass, one of which was his own. As he said something about his father, he then smiled and started to smile again. The young man smiled back. “So, who was it?” I asked. “Yes,” he replied, not knowing that I was asking. He pointed to a cabinet on the opposite wall. “What do you mean?” “Well,” he said, “It’s the one with the orange. That’s my drink.” “Well,” he said, not letting me finish my drink. “I have to run.” “I am afraid it’s very hot, I don’t want you drinking.” “Why are you asking?” I asked. “You’ll have to get up and if you’re going to do that, we all need to move a little, get ourselves going a little, and maybe you can join me over there at the bar after I’ve had that drink.”","There was a great thump. TIM RICE I have just returned from a day in the sun on a sunny island off the coast of France. As the sun set behind me and I reflected on all that I had done for the community over the years, I was struck by a thought. It is so hard to express in words the depth and breadth of human involvement and compassion for others, it is so difficult to even begin to capture the scale of my actions. It is a question of how much my actions truly represent the values I hold dear. IF I could capture the depth and breadth of human involvement and compassion in two words I believe I could do so. It was a question of how much my actions truly represent the values I hold dear. After all, when I started this program, I had never before spoken at length about the human condition, never before had I tried to understand the issues around human rights, the dignity and rights of the human person, or of the human family, and certainly never before had I pondered such an issue deeply. It has become a lifelong dream to try to give voice to the needs of people around the world. It is a cause that is dear to my heart. I have been touched to see what I have achieved, both as a young person pursuing a dream, and as an adult striving to protect those in need. TIM RICE It is with great excitement I am going to launch today’s program into the community. I hope we can make a difference by promoting human rights, promoting equality in the workplace, and by bringing about change on the front line, whether it be through technology, the environment, or policy and, above all, through our participation. I look forward to sharing the progress of this mission through the written and spoken word."
C2,"A few months ago I saw an advert in the Telegraph for a company that would be called Pfizer. Pfizer’s website didn’t show any ads for the company so I wondered where I could buy some and I found that by trawling through a newspaper advertising section there were two ads for the company in the Daily Mail. It was only when I delved into the newspaper’s advertisements that I discovered this was indeed a Pfizer advertisement – one for the food company and the other for the drug company. The Daily Mail reported that a Pfizer advertising campaign had reached the US and that Pfizer had used it to promote its new anti-cancer drug for breast cancer. So the implication of that statement was that the company was advertising a health product for breast cancer. Of course this wasn’t what the Daily Mail had said. On the contrary; they claimed that the campaign was for a new medicine that would cure the disease. I don’t know exactly what the implication of that statement was but it’s certainly believable that one of the agencies involved in the ad pushed the drug for the benefit of the cancer patients. Then there’s the obvious political motive. As I read the newspaper, I couldn’t help but notice that it was a report from the Washington Post that claimed that the drugs were being used by cancer patients to cure their cancer. There was not a single word of that report about advertising. And it’s not just the newspaper that makes this claim. The Financial Times published an article claiming that Pfizer’s advertising was aimed at cancer patients. Of course, I had to ask myself what they meant by that. Was it a PR stunt or a smear campaign? It didn’t seem to me like a journalist in the Times would say the very same thing. But I suppose he’s just making the most of the situation. In the months that followed many of these headlines went viral with thousands of people making their own opinions known online. I began to suspect that many of the articles had actually been spun by a group of senior officials in the industry who were attempting to capitalize on the heightened attention. If so, why did they feel the need to comment on the stories in the press? Or did they believe they were useful in shaping the public’s opinion? Is it just me, or do they just look at all these articles as a publicity stunt by the mainstream press? There is a reason that these headlines were thrown out of the newspapers. I remember the headlines for the Cancer Drug Association and the Drench magazine. The first article is titled “New anti-cancer drug launches by an emerging drug company”. At the top, we see a woman wearing a dress made by a masked woman. The next article shows her wearing a skirt made of a white material called Acetate. I’m not sure what this is meant to mean. Maybe some of the women were being paid by these doctors to spread this message... maybe they had a campaign and they knew it had an angle that the mainstream press would not consider. That was not to say that people couldn’t or wouldn’t find the articles to be useful. They were a good tool for spreading the word. In the end I decided that the article had been used as an advert for an anti-cancer drug. In the end I decided that she was doing a bit of a disservice by not mentioning it in the headline. Apparently the news article was not so serious. So there are a couple more headlines in this article that seem to make little sense. They have the right to say that the news is fake, even though they aren’t. They are not even going to say that they did not find it factually inaccurate. They may even have given you a few more things to chew on as well. In fact, they’ve just given us a bit more to chew on.","A friend was preparing to leave the country. Suddenly there was a sudden flash of light in the distance, then something terrible happened. Within an hour, his plane was at the airport. After a short delay he was in London on business, but he was just in time to meet a client at Heathrow. There was a panicky buzz around the airport. The business travel industry was in its grip. The airlines were refusing to make money as before, but the economy was doing okay. There were no longer the problems with the housing market or the economic uncertainty which caused it to decline over the past few years. People were rethinking everything they ever thought they knew about themselves. And there was an awful lot of it. The recession, combined with the loss of confidence in the financial sector and the re-emergence of the tobacco industry, was a disaster for all businesses. A few people were able to hold on but it was clear that a lot of people would soon not be around any more. For those lucky enough to find work in London, the prospects were good, but the economy still had a long way to go. The banks were still struggling to get the financial system back on track, but things are improving. The government is starting to come to grips with its failure to bail out the banks as promised. Those new credit regulations will mean the loss of almost $4.5 billion on mortgage and consumer credit every month for at least the next two years, and that amount is likely to double over the next five years. Even though the economy is improving, the recession is making life harder for everyone in the business world. The crisis for some is so acute that they are willing to sacrifice their own pensions and a certain level of social security to escape the economic slowdown. The question for most is whether they can afford to. There is little doubt that the crisis will not go away soon, but the outlook for the economy will be tough for a very long time to come. The UK, the biggest economy in the Western world, was not the only country that would suffer as a result of the recession. As soon as the recession began in the United States, the US economy was hit hard. In fact, some say that the worst recession of the modern era took place in the US in the first month of 1989. The ensuing recovery led to a rise in the rate of employment in the US to a five year high in the spring of 1990, the first quarter of the year and the first quarter in the whole decade. Moreover, with the US economy in the same condition as it was in 1990, the jobless rate dipped in the US by 18,000 and continued to fall for several more months after that. The problem is that in most developed countries it lasted well into the early 1990s, albeit with a decrepit recovery in early 1990s. Most countries saw a significant downturn in their business sectors during this period. For example, Britain's GDP only grew by a very modest 12,000 in 1990 compared to the 2.4 million that it grew by during the 1960s and 1970s. Other countries, like Japan and India, had seen their share prices plummet over the previous decade. So while the early years of the 1990s was hard and bleak for many of us, it was also a very happy period for advertising. The big advertising firms had been able to avoid bankruptcy or being forced to move to new premises in an era of austerity, but there were signs that things were beginning to improve. In the summer of 1992, at the height of the summer slump, the BBC used an advert to congratulate a woman who was celebrating her 50th birthday. The agency's copy writer was impressed. He had previously received very positive feedback for his efforts on a local radio programme called ""Inviting Enemies."" Obviously this advertising campaign, and the following dozens, had brought much happiness to the woman. The commercial, which became an instant hit on British television, was a success and prompted several more advertising firms to follow suit. And on this side of the Atlantic, two years later, another agency was celebrating 50 years. For an agency, 50 years is a long time. Yet the advertising world has had time to adjust its ways. And although some advertising firms have taken steps to address the issues associated with the recession, others have simply adopted the same business-as-usual approach. There have been a few good times. This is not to say the recession has not had an impact on the advertising industry. It has, in fact, created new businesses that are now booming. Advertising on trial Fortunately for us in the advertising industry, the recession is","The marketing department of a large advertising agency was on trial. Every project I worked on was scrutinised, every budget spent and every creative direction questioned. If it wasn’t obvious at that time that there was something wrong in advertising then how could it be expected that things would be so radically different within the next decade? Unless of course advertising was on trial too. I had to make a difficult decision and, because of the way things were, I made the decision to leave. I would be unable to return to the place where I had made a name for myself and to the colleagues I had created. I decided to resign, I knew there were plenty of people who were in the same position. It would be best to see the problem, if there was one, through their eyes, so that no one was thrown into it. I had to make the decision to not return to the company from which I had left. It was a choice I had made because I didn’t know that I would have to leave. I wanted to get my career back on track. I had always thought that after all this time I would find some sort of way to get back into advertising. I had gone to the trouble of setting up a business. I made a plan to make my money, I knew what that meant and I knew that I could afford it. My business was a little unusual in that I had worked for a large number of clients, which allowed me to keep my business very close to my heart. However, it meant my job wasn’t what it had been and I couldn’t rely on my own resources as much as I would have liked. I needed a change. I needed to move in a direction that would benefit my clients and me. It had to be different, different from the way I had been in the past. I needed to step outside the industry I was in and to the creative direction I was used to. It was the best decision I had made because I knew that I had helped establish and run an advertising agency. I wanted the opportunity to be a part of something truly special, the one that would make my clients think I was a great person. I was a creative director after all and I could see how this role would suit me well. At least it gave me a chance to demonstrate my new talent. I had to do things I didn’t expect to do; I wasn’t even going to be given a full brief. I was going to have to find a way to make something truly new. I had to move to a new location, it wasn’t an easy decision. I wanted to be able to go to the New York office and work on the new direction of an advertising agency which was a new direction for me. The decision that I had to make was to leave, but I owed my job to my clients and I did not have the opportunity to do so. I thought that my clients would appreciate this decision and they may even be willing to pay me. If they were, it wouldn’t necessarily have been to the new creative direction of our agency. It was much more important that we put together a great business plan for our agency which they could take advantage of in case things fell apart. In the end, I decided that the time had come to leave. I did so but not entirely for the reasons that I thought. The financial crisis of 2008 meant that I was in a stronger position to make it through. I had worked with a lot of new and experienced people during this period, but it meant that, for most, I was still a student of my craft. There was nothing I could do but make what I felt I needed to do to get a chance at a new career. When that opportunity came, I jumped at the opportunity. I moved to New York because, on that one evening, I was trying to decide whether I wanted to be an advertising exec or a marketing manager. My colleagues had already made the choice. I was in a position where I could make some decisions about the future, but not about the specific direction of my business. My ego was not going to be able to carry me through. I was a creative director and a marketing executive at the same time, and they had not considered the possibility of working together. If only I had known that I was going to be able to be a marketing executive. I was so excited that I felt like I had stumbled upon my calling in a new world. I was convinced that the agency I was leaving would be","The Advertising Industry in the early 1990s was on trial before a judge. The business recession was longer deeper and more severe than anticipated, hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years. At the end of the day, the advertising industry's share of the economy was a dwindling commodity to be sold and not just consumed by advertising. Most of the advertising industry's clients were sceptics of advertising's ability to increase sales. They felt cheated that their money had been wasted because of the lack of advertising. And so it was that a group of cynics decided to open their own lawsuit against advertising. The case was against advertising's supposed failure to take advantage of the recession. The plaintiffs had argued that the advertising industries had failed to properly forecast how the economic downturn would affect the advertising business. They were not making money. They were just surviving. It was just a matter of time before that reality proved to them. The plaintiffs were a small group of ad executives who tried to make the case for a lack of advertising. They argued that the recession had pushed companies into bankruptcy. It had hit so hard that it had hurt even the most well-to-do. It had thrown the whole of the advertising industry into disarray. The plaintiffs were outraged and felt that the case had been thrown out of court because they had failed to show the evidence that they needed to do so. However, the lawyers in the case were convinced that all was not lost. They argued that their arguments were based on the basis of a very strong and logical case, based on what they believed to be the strongest evidence in the case. They argued that their argument had the basis of good old fashioned realism. The court decided that they did not need to make such a strong case in order to win. To them, the only evidence they needed to make was a solid case, not based on some vague realism and not based on an entirely unrealistic one. They believed that the economic recession had only caused the business crisis, that the recession would not last forever. They argued that their argument was a weak one and would be overturned in the next round of appeal. The court therefore remanded them to the district court in London for further trial in the United Kingdom. The case was not heard until three years later in 1996.","Adverts on trial The famine in business was bad enough but advertising, as a form of entertainment, was in a special state of embarrassment. As advertising agencies tried to cope with the crisis, the general feeling was that advertising and advertising agencies, in general, had run out of ideas. In other words they had run out of the ideas that had made it so easy for people to buy everything they need and wanted, including the ads they wanted. With advertising on trial, however, there was more than one way to solve the problem. For that, agencies needed to reinvent themselves, with new ideas, new techniques, new products, and new ways of presenting a product. The result was the idea of the agency called Adlab. This was born after a crisis at the London Stock Exchange, when banks and financial institutions failed to honour their financial commitments. Adlab realised that if they did not create new ideas quickly, the businesses affected would be crippled. The idea was to set up a design studio to take on all the work, with designers coming in from around the world to come up with new ideas and improve the creative output. This took time, as the creative director had to have a number of different ideas for each project. But once the design studio had been set up, it was more efficient for the company to produce the designs. The idea was to have a creative team on hand to work on each project as it came in. This ensured that everyone worked in the same room, so there was an extremely high level of communication. The agency took on a number of new clients, including Coca Cola, Nissan, and Coca-Cola Japan. All of this was an important part of what allowed it to be a success. In the first few years, it was a very high volume year for advertising agencies, and they had to be very careful with which projects they took on. But, with the change of culture in a recession and a creative economy still in its early stages, there were only a few big, successful projects. One was the Mercedes project. It had been a whirlwind of activity, involving multiple agencies, brands, and agencies from across the globe. As it was an advertising world record, the team at Adlab had to find the right way to communicate the big ideas to the client, attracting the right media, and meeting the right deadlines. They needed to get a new, creative way to get a new client. The new creative team needed a new concept to be implemented as soon as possible so they could make some major changes and keep their client happy. Adlab turned to a consultant, who had expertise in designing and managing advertising campaigns, to take on the challenge of presenting the client’s new concept. The new creative director took a keen interest in the new approach, and quickly understood how it would benefit his client. Although he was working with an outside creative agency, he was able to use his knowledge of how to work with a creative agency and the industry to create a new brand and story. This was just a way to get through what had already been a challenging period for advertising agencies.","The case of the lion was the subject of one of the major cases of the day, that was an advertisement to the UK public calling for a new lion. The case was brought against an advertising agency with three partners, a head and a pair of directors. The plaintiffs wanted the case quashed, but the judge denied their request. The judge had ordered the case put on hold. After the first week of hearings a second court case was held, one that had an advertising agency from London, and another from Chicago, as well as the two plaintiffs. The case was a major success, but the judge, who gave the case the title of Judge of Advertising, said that although the court was able to get the advertising company out of the case it was in reality insolvent. He had also found that the defendant advertising agency had engaged an experienced businessman to act as its advertising director, but the businessman had refused to do so. The judge dismissed the appeal, and the third court case was never called.","In advertising we are all pressed on to make money. The business climate is so difficult now that your creative team are struggling to put together a new campaign and you aren’t allowed to have a good laugh. You’re left wondering how to make the ad come together. There is no doubt that advertising on trial would seem to be a good story for A2 learners, but I think even a story written at this level isn’t likely to stand up in court. So maybe it’s best to keep it short, keep it light and leave it to your classmates to ponder. This story may require some research, but as long as you keep it interesting it will stand up!"
C2,"I thought I was prepared for the hiccups that may come a bit before being able to do my first published poem. However, the first thing I did was to write a poem about the joys I feel in my life. I figured if I would just write a poem about myself and my life, it would be easier to be honest and sincere. I have a lot to say about a lot of topics, but I hope to be able to find the time to write about them soon enough. In the meantime, here are a few poems that I’ve written for the challenge. A little musing and some inspiration...","The book of verse is as ancient as Christianity itself. It is the oldest book ever written. The first of a great series of books, it also carries the earliest knowledge of the world that is still widely used today. However, the original form of poetry has been passed down from generation to generation. It is also one of the most difficult forms of writing poetry. It requires years of practice, patience, and attention to detail. Therefore, in this article we are going to present some tips on how to write poetry. The first is a technique called free verse. Free verse is a style of poetry that is free of rhyme and can be written in any style. It uses words and sounds that cannot be expressed using any other style. For instance, in a free verse, you have to use a few words such as 'I', 'you', or 'one' as they are all made up words that don't have their own meaning or purpose. Some people aren't very interested in free verse poetry. They tend to write them to share their creative genius with others. However, free verse is very boring. As a result, they are usually written by people who can't remember the meaning of these words. Some free verse has rhyme schemes that contain syllables and letters. Some free verse has meter that is structured to rhyme with 'a' 'd' 'e. For example, 'Hey there' is a syllable 'ahh' 'b' 'dd' which ends in 'c' but is still one syllable so is not actually rhyme. 'A' is a syllable that can end in 'ccc' which ends in 'd' and is also syllable. For example, 'This is' has syllable 'cc' and is also syllable. 'O' is a syllable that can end in 'e' and is also syllable. Therefore, 'O' is syllable that ends in 'o' and is also syllable. However, 'A' is not syllable that ends in 'e' which is also syllable. For instance, 'O' is syllable that ends in 'b' and is also syllable. The next step is to take two lines that rhyme with's'. One line should be 'o' and the other should be 'a'. Then you will have two lines that rhyme with 'i'. 'E' and 'I' are separated by an s. For example, 'E' is syllable which ends in 'cc' and is also syllable. For instance, 'E' is syllable which ends in 'i' and is also syllable. Then you can write 'a', which is an s. For example, 'A' is syllable which ends in 'i' and is also syllable. Finally, you can write 'I' which is an i. For example, 'E' is syllable which ends in 'e' and is also syllable. Therefore, you will have two lines that rhyme with 'I'. Therefore, you can write 'I' and then follow it up with 'I'.","One day I was working on a writing assignment for my English class. My topic for the assignment was ‘Poetry’. I wanted to use my own experience as a case study to demonstrate how useful the skills of writing poetry can be. So I decided to research poetry as an example of its potential for practical writing. The Internet seemed to be a great place to start. It was easy to find examples of other people’s work, and it was obvious that different people have different techniques. Here’s what I came up with. I hope it gives anyone new to poetry inspiration. In this article, I focus on the ‘Poetry’ section of the site which, as a general rule, is the place for both formal and informal writing. These types of poetry include the following: Prose In Prose This section includes examples of poems that are more often found on the internet. It is not a definitive list of all of the poems that have been written, but a useful place to start with. Prose In Prose This section includes examples of different types of poems written by people from all over the world. It includes the following: In prose poetry, the word ‘poetry’ itself is not the most important part of the poem. It should be clear what it is about the poem and should also have a clear, single meaning. For example, if a poem is about the death of a loved one, it may not really be about that person. However, it could be about the death of a loved one or a death that takes place at some point in the future. It may be something like this: ‘Brother, I see your love life has taken a toll on you, so I would like to write a poem that takes you through the pain that you feel.’ This will hopefully help to show that the poem is a valid example of a form of poetry. However, you may also find that there are many different types of poetry. These poems can be written in a number of different ways, including stanza poems, prose poems, free verse and a lot more.","I’m a big fan of poetry. I’ve always been in an infatuation with the words themselves, and there’s a very different feel to reading and writing poetry when compared to writing novels, or a short story. One of my favorite forms of writing poetry is rap poetry. I love seeing people’s interpretations of the same thing in different ways. When I’m writing I’ve been able to see different angles on the same topic, from the view of a teen boy struggling with a situation in high school to a stifled teen girl writing about a friend struggling with some angst in her life. I have also learned a lot from reading poetry. First, it can be pretty hard to understand why poets write poetry. They are often trying to express something they’ve never had to say before. Poetry is a way of capturing what we want to say. It’s a kind of storytelling. But poetry is more than that. It’s about creating something beautiful. When I’m reading poems, I always find it hard to figure out what the purpose of each line is. One thing about rap poetry, is it’s really different from traditional poetry. It’s very expressive. It’s also a way to express feelings. The other thing that is unique about rap poetry is it’s so personal. It really makes you think about what’s on your mind. You can go crazy writing rap poetry. I’ve been infatuated with rap poetry for a while now and I know exactly what kind of rap I want to do. There’s something about the rhythm and the sound that appeals to me. It’s something different. It’s something I could write a book on. If I were able to be that kind of artist, I’d have a whole career in music. Poetry is very unique and it’s hard to find someone that can come close to that. But rap poetry is a great way to get to know someone. It’s something that really excites me and makes me want to know more about them. The biggest takeaway here from reading poetry is that it’s a way to express yourself. If you want to be an artist then it’s probably best to find a form of rap that you enjoy. My current favorite rap poet is Tisto. The title of his last album is One Heartbeat Apart. It’s an amazing record, it has so many different styles and rap beats you could really get a sense of a variety of sounds. But if you want to be an entrepreneur then you need to make some money. Getting a good job is a huge passion for him, so he may just be the next rap star. Getting a good job isn’t the only way to earn money. There are a lot of jobs that pay very well if you can learn how to make good money doing it. But what if you need to earn some extra cash? Just start rapping and you won’t have to worry about the kind of work you have to do, you just write. And the best part about being a rap artist is he can write whatever the hell you want. You can write anything you want. You can write something about love, hate, anger or anything that you can. The only thing that you don’t have to worry about is having the right style for you. You just need to get your thoughts down and start to write. Luckily for the people in the world, there are many different forms of rap music, so your chances of being in someone’s top rap artist are a high 90%. So make sure you always write something good, even if it’s just to write. If you’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur then you’re probably going to want to be a rap artist. This makes rap music a great alternative to more traditional forms like writing a book. What I have learned from reading rap poetry is that it can be difficult to write poetry. It is tough to find a rhythm or a style to fit into. So, if you want to write poetry, just be inspired by the different sounds you hear around you and the things that you see, and just write what’s on your mind. It’s a great way to think about the world around you. In the end, rap is really just a way to express emotion. If you’re really into writing poetry, you may want to focus on creating something that’s more artistic. It takes a","My parents were friends and we spent quite a few days frolicking in the rain, in the sun and on the sea in France. The more I write, I realise that it’s a kind of therapy: for me, it’s a chance to talk about the nature of human behaviour and the problems that exist for the people who live in the world. My parents’ friend who is a poet told me that poetry is a lot like painting. There are certain painters who are able to paint in an organic way in which shapes develop and colors bleed as they are immersed in an image, and for me, writing poetry is like painting a landscape in my head. When you’ve painted that landscape, you can’t say anything else as it still needs to look real. I want people to notice the detail and the mood of the painting, but I also want them to see the essence of the painting, as well as the surface, in order to try and understand it. That is why I think it’s so important to listen when people read your poem and squint at the things you have written: there’s a lot that you have to be careful not to let distract you from your creativity. I’m not sure if there’s an age limit for poetry as long as people aren’t afraid to challenge themselves, but I believe that you should allow yourself to be challenged, to look at your writing and ask yourself “what is going on here?” This can help you write poetry that is fresh and unique and doesn’t look like it has been written many times before. Try to think of a concept that you’ve been thinking about as if it is real: for instance, you might be writing about the rain, as if that is something that’s important for the people who live in this world. You could start by thinking about how you think a poem is similar to a landscape. There could be mountains and rivers and you could even be thinking of an atmosphere or place. A lot of people think they should make their poems as beautiful and interesting as possible. It’s true that people are often not the best at writing rhymes, but you can still make sure they sound nice to read. When writing poems that feel more or less like a dream, you should aim for an atmosphere and a mood. The world is a messy and confusing place, and the only way you can make people’s heads pop is to write poems that are as simple as possible to understand. Try to make the words squirm with meaning and that’s something you can do by using simple language in the poem. I try to explain how words move and how words build each other so that it’s easier to understand what is going on in the poem. This is the way I think you should also think about when you start your poem and whether your poem ties into the poem in some way. Another way to think about when you start your poem is to think about the title. The title of your poem should catch the reader’s attention, so if you think about what you’d like to say when you write that poem, you are more likely to get those things you want to say out. Think about how your poem could end so that you can end it with a happy and exciting conclusion. That’s what I try to do when I write a poem.",how to write poetry how to write poem in my head what poetry mean how to write poem in my head,"How to Write Poetry. I started writing poetry by trying to write verses at the age of 12. It's something I do all the time, it's my natural way of expressing things. But sometimes, I get into trouble when I don't follow through because I think I've started too late, so I'm back to square one. After a while, I realized my mistakes and that's when I decided to try to write a poem about my love. After some time, I realized I didn't write enough, so I wrote this poem. It's about love and how we're feeling on our special day. I didn't expect this to turn out as well as it did."
C2,"Despite the fact that many people consider the Internet to be a sort of twit box, the fact that there are some really good critics online is something to celebrate. The fact that there are still academics who make use of the Internet to do genuinely excellent work speaks volumes. I have always admired the fact that there is an entire community of academics who put together a huge amount of online literary criticism for the enjoyment of the general public. This community is called Online Literary Criticism for All (OLCA). It is currently housed on the Harvard Extension School site, but is gradually expanding internationally, as OLCA will soon be celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. OLA was founded in 1999 as an open access project to gather up online criticism in a central location, and to be published in a definitive, peer-reviewed volume. In the first years of this project, only a handful of contributors, including a handful of faculty, are actively involved. Then, in late 2001, the project foundered on a host of technical and moral issues, including the presence of an anonymous commenting system that would have enabled all contributors to respond. OLCA was eventually dissolved after a few months of disarray, and then relaunched as The Literary Analysis Network in 2005. The network has gone through several changes since its inception, including changing its name, becoming a project-based entity, and launching a new website. In addition to the new site, OLA launched the ""Open Culture"" section of its website, inviting readers to comment on a wide range of texts, from the classics to new and obscure authors, while also including reviews, poetry and criticism devoted to all kinds of subjects. There are also plenty of links to other online literary criticism resources.",It is not without its problems. It was just one of the many ways that the World Wide Web was supposed to offer people a vast amount of free information and knowledge. A little bit of knowledge is also always good to have.,"The Internet has exploded since 1990. Whether it's the rapid rise of blog culture, instant messaging or social networking, many people use the web for entertainment or self-expression. However, in this new age, there has also been a serious attempt to harness the potential of the Internet to revolutionise writing, teaching, research and many other aspects of our lives. One such site, Net Book Club, is a forum designed to provide an online archive and archive of scholarly criticism. It was set up in March 2001 by several scholars working on English literature. Net Book Club contains scholarly essays written by expert contributors of a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. These experts have put in substantial amount of time and effort to produce scholarly publications. The members are currently working on a database which will include work from all over the world. The goal of Net Book Club is to collect and preserve scholarly works of the most widely read authors in English literature. However, some of the pieces on the Net Book Club website are problematic and a large number are under copyright. The Internet has opened up this new medium to all, with some of the world’s greatest scholars creating sites in order to share their expertise. In addition, this has also helped to stimulate interest and scholarly discussion. There is no doubt that Net Book Club can offer something to everyone.","Many books on the Internet are accessible to anyone who knows how to read, but few of them are accessible to people who have little or no understanding of their content. Likewise, very few of the online literary criticism websites that are accessible to the public today would be considered scholarly and authoritative a generation ago. Several of these sites are no longer functional or available for user use. The first was Literary Hub (or THB). It was founded in 1999 by a writer and critic named Michael A. Green, who sat on the faculty of the University of Michigan's Graduate School of Journalism. The first site on which he served as editor was THB's Literary Guides website, which in 2003 had the distinction of being the only site in the United States to offer literary criticism for free. Now there are nearly 1200 websites providing literary criticism. They range from encyclopedias to scholarly texts, and even from classic literary analysis to pop culture criticism. It is also likely that, in a few years time, the THB Literary Guides website will be discontinued, and its literature pages may be sold or merged with other sites.","By Tim O’Connell, author of the literary criticism blog, “Freethinking.net”. What began as a joke in 1994 at Harvard’s Berkman Center became, in its first four years, an increasingly serious and credible attempt to provide a forum for public discussion on the literature of the English-speaking world. “It was a brilliant experiment which grew exponentially and has now led to an expanding range of criticisms on novels, plays, television and film from the best critics worldwide,” O’Connell says. The project has received funding from the British Academy, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the UK Council for the Humanities and the US National Endowment for the Humanities. One hundred and forty criticisms have been submitted for evaluation by experts, ranging from academics and academics to ordinary people, some of whom are academics themselves. O’Connell says that it may have been inspired by an earlier online forum in which a group of people took criticisms posted on a blog and voted on their favourite. “The idea of this was to provide another way for people to debate their favourite writing,” he says. The idea originated a year or two ago in the British Academy’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society where they were promoting their research in literature and technology. At the time, academics and critics had joined forces to form the online criticism project. “In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet, but in practice, a certain amount of technical know-how was required, at least in the early years,” O’Connell tells ELTonline. According to O’Connell, it was just a matter of coming up with an idea for a site, if it wanted to go beyond just criticism. He says the site had been ‘born out of a sense of frustration’ at the limitations of traditional criticism and the often one-sided and unfair responses. “You could only submit it if you had the technical know-how to make it happen,” he says. O’Connell sees O’Connell’s initiative as a sign of the times. “People are increasingly turning to the Internet for their own research, for their own knowledge, for their own pleasure,” he says. Online criticism for all aims to provide the technical background and tools to make these ideas and projects possible. O’Connell hopes to help provide access to some of the world’s best writers. The project is currently seeking experts to comment on its work. O’Connell is based at the New American Library in Washington, D.C. and has written for publications including the Daily Beast, the Guardian, the New Republic, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. He is a frequent contributor to the Guardian and has written for the Washington Post, The Atlantic, the New Yorker and the Washington Post.","Using the Internet and the Web 2.0 tools and applications, anyone can quickly and easily build a website of their own.

C2,"Chen was a big brother and he was always worried about Lily. The way the two sisters had been driving kept him sheltered from any danger until recently when the car started doing dangerous stunts. He had taken his eyes off Lily while she was driving over the hump-backed bridge and into the gasworks, but when they saw him again, Lily had slowed and he was terrified. Then Chen said “Well, how did you do it?” and Lily looked at Chen. She knew it was going to be alright because when Lily slowed down she would still be able to pass.","Lily rushed to the station and jumped out of the car. Chen stood by the car and stared at the car. “I’m not sure Lily is fit enough to drive that car,” Chen said. “I hope you can walk out of the back.” The two sisters stared at Lily. “This isn’t the kind of car she’s fit for. The gas and air are toxic and the road is extremely muddy and wet,” Chen said. “This is how you come to discover Lily’s driving ability?” Lily looked away and smiled at Chen. “I’ve seen Lily drive before, I know what she’s capable of, but I’ve never been in a car. I’ll get you to drive us to the station so we can find the truth.” Chen looked at the sister as they both looked at Lily.","It was obvious they were trying to hide Lily’s driving because she was clearly the best driver in the family, but they were only giving her a few lessons so she would learn to drive correctly. Chen did not care too much for Lily’s driving and soon abandoned her as she would break her ankle. He felt that Lily should be allowed to drive at night when it would be safe. Chen then waited for Lily to come home and took her sister’s old car and drove home with her.","The girls were at dinner at their house when the father of Chen came in. He said that the eldest of the three women looked like a twit. He said: “What is that?” and then said: “Damn, why didn’t you tell me? You’re driving.” Chen looked incredulous. “I thought you were just playing.” The sisters sighed and looked at each other. Lily nodded her head in agreement and smiled.","The twins were sitting on their couch chatting when Chen stepped out and knocked on the door. They both knew he was at work because he was answering the phone. Chen looked over at his sister Lily and asked her where she was. Lily’s face turned pale and she realised that Chen sounded desperate so they both hugged her and asked her to drive her home. Chen looked at Lily, then walked over to Lily, kissed her, and took her home.",The two sisters kept Lily’s driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily’s only misjudgment) before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone.,The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time.

C2,... You can write it off with a smile or even just a frown. You can also give it a name and a reason for having it.,I had big big boots. They were really big. These cowboy boots were so big they crinkled the skin of my leg.,"There was a sudden thunderclap and the rain started to fall. I shivered and felt cold. I knew that there were a couple of things that had happened today. Firstly, the boots had been soaked and were muddy so I needed a waterproof. I sat on the sand and hoped that the rain would stop. I had worn my rain boots for one day but then had to get up and change and went inside. I thought that my boots were fine and only had to go back inside the house to change. I had not been in the water for a long while so the boots had not been worn that long. Secondly, all of a sudden, my two kids, ages 6 and 6 were sitting on the porch in awe of my boots. They are not old enough to have seen the pictures that are on the wall but the day had certainly brought them to see them. They looked at my boots with wonder and even gave me a big smile. I gave them a big hug and told them that there were some prickly pears in the yard, however they sneezed and fell into the sand with a great deal of disgust. I went to check out their toys and to see if they could take the pears. They were just about to pick out some toy cowboy hats, but I was too nervous and had walked out too close. I had a huge smile on my face when I saw the two prickly pears. The boy whose prickly pears I had bought, must have been impressed and said, “Yes, it was a gift from my cowboy father.” I pointed this out to the girl and she told me that the prickly pears were fakes and she would be going out with them immediately. The girl had two pairs of prickly pears and they had just arrived from France. I told them that I was going to pick them up from the prickly pears market this evening and give them to them so that they could take them home. They told me that they were not from France. I told them that they could go home with me.",But I was happy with the way I looked and my style.,"Then I paused. After some time, I suddenly felt a sense of guilt. I hadn’t planned on wearing my boots. It turned out that they had been stored, not ridden, for nearly twenty years in my closet. They were stacked neatly on the wall of my bedroom closet. I had planned on doing some chores in them. But I decided to wear them, thinking I was just a tourist. I walked around the room trying to decide what to do with them. Finally I decided not to leave them on the table. The next day I went to the store and bought a new pair. They were black and had the brand name stamped on them. I could now wear them with some jeans and jeans, and a cute top. I’d love to walk out the door, wearing this ensemble, and ride to a cowboy outpost somewhere. The outfit would still make me a cowboy even if the boots weren’t on. After the cowboy outpost shopping I went to lunch with my cowboy pal and then I joined the other tourist in enjoying this experience. In the afternoon I walked into the store and bought a new pair of cowboy boots. I went out to the store with my friend. When I returned my friend pointed out that my cowboy boots were just the wrong size. “Were you sure you bought the wrong size cowboy boots?” the friend asked, looking at my cowboy outfit. “I have the wrong size cowboy boots,” I said. He took them off and re-started his engine. I got into my brand new big boots and started riding. The next day I had to go back to the shop to go back and change them. I got to change into my new brand new big boots. And I stood there for a few minutes. I started to feel a little nauseous. I didn’t feel nervous at all and then something slipped in my shoe. Something tight. But the boots were still nice. My new boots were comfortable. I tried walking back to the house. But before I could ride again, I felt guilty. I wanted to have a drink on my way back but I didn’t want to wake up, so I rode a horse down to the parking lot. As I sat down I looked at my outfit. It was all good. It was really comfortable and I felt happy.","Then I took off my cowboy boots and looked at the landscape. It is not the most beautiful landscape in the world, but it was interesting. I took pictures of the rocky formations and if I can just use my camera to create a video. That is not possible. But I decided that I'd try anyway. And I filmed this cowboy boot photo in a new Arizona desert formation. This was an original Arizona desert formation. It is not that big. And it's not that hard to get to. This was a very cold day. So I decided that I'd drive there. It is about twenty minutes from my home town. I got out of my car and drove across the country. It was a long, rough trip. And I have a lot to learn about how to drive here. And about the culture. And the language. And the music. And the culture.","At first, the boots didn't feel as big as I expected they would. They were a size 18 1/2. I guess I need to buy size 18 boots next time. I can't imagine wearing this outfit any other way."
C2,"It looks like a wren — but can we be sure this isn't a ghost bird? We've got a wren in the greenhouse, and we're all about the spirit birds. Paul Evans is a writer, photographer, and director living in the North West of England. He enjoys hunting, drinking, reading, and walking his dog. He's also a keen owl hunter and a frequent visitor to his local owl centre. His most recent ode, In the Company of... Wrens, comes out in the autumn.","We all know birds have a lot to do with us—not only in our everyday lives but in the realm of cultural icons as well. This article by Paul Evans will explore a variety of bird-themed objects in the contemporary world, including: ""Wrens are used by ancient cultures to determine the outcome of battles. Some wren figurines, for instance, are given to the winners of gladiatorial fights, while others are used as part of ancient petroglyphs."" Including some of the most popular and historically significant bird figurines, the article will explore how the birds that are most highly decorated in our culture are a direct reflection of us as humans.","The little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass as a small bird bounces against the glass. The wren is a member of the warbler family - and as it always does in our greenhouse, it also has a wing pointing back toward the door. The wren looks a lot like my father, who is a birdwatcher. But that's not entirely how it looks: it's browner, it has a hood instead of beak, and it does have yellow legs instead of orange ones. My father's belief was that wrens were ominous. I wasn't so sure. Wrens are a type of warbler. Wrens were believed to predict war. To keep our minds from getting too much into the world, he kept the birds in a cage he'd built himself - one of four large, sturdy cages he has in his garden. He's put a number of them on top of the cage, one at each end of the cage to act as a warning beacon. He's even placed small crows and wrens - the latter being a common bird that is regarded as good luck - on top of the cage. In this case, I had to have the crow, or my father had to be home when I found it. Suddenly my father got very excited. Wrens are said to have the ability to see invisible creatures. ""It's like having a mind of its own,"" he says. As I explain that it's impossible to see the wren's tail feathers - and that they will not touch if you haven't got your head back - he starts to talk about birds in general. Wrens are a common pest. There have been problems with the birds coming to my greenhouse, claiming the house itself. The wrens have become a real nuisance. And so I put up more cages. He took the wrens to a local farmer who says they aren't dangerous and say that they are more likely to come when you have a window open. His advice was simple: ""If you see this wren, do not bother to get out of the house."" When you do see him, his beak snores. The wrens will sit on the metal bars in the cage with their head sticking out a little bit if you come close enough. ""This is my first year in our new house, so I do not know whether there are other wrens,"" he says. ""It's not my first bird so I don't know exactly how bad it's going to get, but it definitely does not look nice."" It was a big win for the wrens. ""I've had lots of wrens coming into the yard, they have been all over the garden.""","The wren has been a symbol of misfortune, a warning of the end of times and the beginning of a new beginning for millennia. In the ancient Egyptians, it was the symbol of gods, messengers and messengers between the worlds. It was also a symbol of love. In the Christian Church, the bird has always been seen as a sign of love. And the same is true in the Muslim world, where wrens have been used to predict the future of humanity. In the Victorian era, they were believed to be warning signals for war, and it was thought that they were believed to be a symbol of impending death. In ancient Greece, wrens were thought to have been the messengers of the gods and are sometimes portrayed as messengers of death. The symbol of the wren is often a harpsichord, but the word wren is actually a form of Greek emako. Similarly, a wren is also associated with the moon and can be used as a harp in music.","A wren, it seems, isn't going to be your usual bird; they're a symbol of change, and for some that means change is coming to the world around them. There's been a boom in the number of bird-watchers and bird-watching companies in recent years, and with it, a surge in the naming and calling of birds, from peacocks and jays to owls and wrens. What was it that started this trend? Paul Evans tells us: We don't like things getting dark. We're prone to call a bird what it can see, even when it's just a few millimeters in height. At the same time, we tend not to like to take the time to hear a bird's calls and be able to recognise that it's an actual, living thing. Some people say it's because we're afraid of the dark and we're afraid of death, but this seems more likely to be an exaggeration than a truth. The owl is one of the oldest bird species, discovered by the Ancient Greeks. It's one of the few animals that can be sighted at night, which is why owls are such an iconic sight in folklore. But what about the little brown shuttlecock? Is it a bird? What does it represent in art and mythology? In short: Yes, the little brown shuttlecock is a bird of ominous portent, augury and divination, but it's not just any bird. Its name suggests that it can predict the future, which was a bit surprising, but it makes sense for a bird to symbolize the uncertain future. So here's why: owls were considered a symbol of the ages, of a golden age of knowledge, while wrens were thought to signify the passing of time. And owls and other hawks were symbolic of witchcraft in the Middle Ages. And wrens were a sign of a new world emerging from the old one. So maybe, if you feel a wren is a sign of the coming of something new, then that would mean there's a lot going on for you to take on board. Hopefully this wren sighting in the greenhouse will be just a small sign of good things to come.","My wren, an ominous bird, bobs against the glass as it bounces against the glass. Despite the bird being an ominous bird, I still see it. The bird is a curious one. I watch it for a few seconds and wonder why people talk about birds as such when it is very likely that a bird isn't even real. It bops against the glass when it's flying over the plants and catches my attention. If it flies past me in an airplane or a car, it flies past a man. It's insidious that people are always talking about birds. We're talking about birds because we want to control them and make them do what we want to them, and that may make us more tame than we think. It may make us more like the birds. But what's a little bump bump against the glass saying? We're not tame birds; we're just creatures with wings and flight. There is a spiritual aspect to birds. When we're taming or killing a bird, we enact the same ritual and beliefs about the bird as we would our house cat. The bird itself enacts an important part of ritual by flying in a spiral around you and flying above you. ""We use the same energy as a bird, and we hold our breath."" When birds fly, they lift our breath to our higher self. So it's not just about birds: It's about us. There's a saying that tells us that if we look up at a bird and watch the shape of the body, we're essentially looking at a reflection of our own self. In order to get at this, we can look up to birds and observe their anatomy and shape. We're also looking at birds through the eyes of someone else: a bird, maybe, but it's someone elses soul. ""What is really fascinating about birds is that we've been trying to figure out how to hold that up to ourselves.""","If your house is adorned with wrens, you could say you have a bird fetish. For centuries, people across the globe have believed that wrens will rob you of wealth, and that they are an omen. They have interpreted the wren as a little messenger to warn you of bad luck. The wren is also believed to be the only living thing on earth that can hear your thoughts, and so a wren in a house is said to be a harbinger of death. We owe a debt to this owl, for we are not able to hear our thoughts – it would be impossible even for us to hear our thoughts – but birds do sound, and they also do speak to us: if it sounds like a wren is saying to you that you should get married, it is. The wren also sounds like a warning that something is about to happen if you listen, or even see the little green thing, that screams, 'Watch, watch, watch, watch!' The wren also sounds like an ancient warning that bad things will happen if you don't keep up with your housekeeping. In all cases, it is believed that birds represent a sort of synchronicity between human activity and the universe, and that the world can sense when we take heed. ""People like wrens because they are able to predict the future,"" said Simon Salloway, a sociologist who specialises in anthropology at University College London. ""But you can't really explain to them what the world really looks like."" The wren is so well known that its name in English was derived from the Greek words wren and omen: the same word meaning 'portent' or 'foretelling', and enos means 'in-to', or 'an-in-to'. As with many myths and legends, we have interpreted these stories to protect us from bad things - for instance, if you keep hearing the 'bump' in the greenhouse, this means that bad things could be coming, and that if you don't listen and take action, it means that you aren't getting the help you need. But it's not so much that the wren is a portent bird. Unlike the other signs, the wren isn't one of those things you just look at for a week or two: when it seems to come in and out of your life, a wren that's a little frightened, or scared, or ill, is more likely to tell you that you have bad news. For example, the owl can often speak to you with a tone of authority that makes you wonder how you would react if one of those messages came true. Instead of viewing the bird, a wren is more likely to frighten or amuse you if it does."
C2,"The lesson begins with a nervous little boy running his hand along the keys. His fingers are nimble, but he’s not sure he has any idea where his thumbs will go. The teacher gently guides him through the rest of the song. “You’re going to make it!” she shouts. “But you need the whole sheet.” “It’s OK, Mom,” says the little boy. As he finishes, Joanna pauses, then a grin spreads across her face. “I’m looking forward to it!” She runs her fingers through the sheet again. “Try and imagine what your teacher looks like,” she asks, then smiles. “She’s big!” and the gleaming face shows off some of her dazzling tone. With the next few lessons, the little boy gets to work on other pieces and – oh yes – learns his ABC song. “I’m really excited,” says Joanna. The little boy’s hands take a deep breath and begin their work with some fun songs. When their practice is done, the teacher says, “Here are a couple of other pieces to show you.” “Now you have a song that you can play, Joanna!” he says. “You can do any of those ones.” But it’s really only the very simple ones that will take his breath away. With each piece, he learns something. “The first one is about singing, and when I played it, I lied on the floor and kept trying my best to sing, but I couldn’t.” “I didn’t know how to sing, either,” he says, then laughs. With each new piece, he starts to play it better, learning a phrase and improving his playing. One day, he even got so good at playing a new song – something he’s been doing every day for weeks. “I played a piece by a Russian composer called Liszt. I’d never heard it before, so I was quite nervous to learn it.” Joanna finishes with a song about the snowflakes and how to make one too. “Is it a bit complicated?” he asks, proudly. “It’s very hard because it’s full of sharp notes, but if you practice it carefully, there’s really not much of a challenge,” he says. “The hardest thing is just finding the notes. You have to practice, practice, practice. “If you practice, you’ll get the hang of it. ” And with each new piece he learns, he grows more excited and proud. And every time he performs, he feels himself grow more confident. “You have to learn the steps. You can do that through practice,” he says proudly. So he has to make up his own way. He doesn’t have to be a pianist. He can be whatever music moves him. “It doesn’t have to be very difficult. It can be as simple as your favorite song. And it can also be very hard. But as long as you practice, practice, practice. And it takes time. Joanna always believes that every student needs to find their own style. She has a special song for kids who can’t read music. When a child is playing a song, she’ll play a little part to help them hear what it’s all about. And the harmonies will bind them together. She says, “It takes practice. And some people might just like to think of something silly instead of trying to play something. That’s just a side effect of the experience. So instead of trying to make them play something that they know, they’ll think of something else they’d like to play.” She says, “But it’s the melody. It’s the emotion. It’s the energy.” The music is more about feeling rather than listening, she says, and that’s exactly right. They can’t always control every sound. This is the thing that Joanna has learned through many years of practicing piano. She says you have to start somewhere, that you have to start with some fun music and then build up your practice. Then it’ll come. And the next time they play, they’ll enjoy it even more.","Joanna MacGregor is a concert pianist with an extremely busy schedule. She spends a great deal of time at the piano and on tour. But even for a member of the mythical species the completely tone deaf, Joanna MacGregor’s performance can not fail to be moved. Even the members of that mythical species are inspired by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Her book, Joanna’s Lessons, was published in 2012. It has been acclaimed by critics, including the Los Angeles Times Book Review and Time. As Joanna MacGregor gets older, she still has a busy concert schedule. She takes time to write books for young children learning to play the piano. It was a logical decision for her, because she knew that the older a child was when they started learning the piano, the harder they would find it. A child in a wheelchair, or even just a young child who could not sit still, would have a lot of trouble learning the piano. After all, many of the most successful pianists were not able to stand for long periods of time. She decided that as a family she needed to work at teaching the young.","Almost everyone who has played the piano has had one person say to them ’you can’t do that’. Joanna MacGregor is one of those people. She has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist and writes books for young children learning the piano. In one of her books, entitled Joanna’s Lessons, a little girl, Amy, asks her grandmother if she can have a lesson, saying that she is very tired. Then Joanna tells her that this really isn’t a problem because, in fact, she already has enough music lessons to go around.","Joanna MacGregor is a concert pianist and the author of several books for young children. She often teaches them at her home in Toronto. In the latest book, Joanna offers lessons for toddlers. She is very enthusiastic about her work and knows how much fun it is to teach little ones new music. When Joanna is not playing a solo recital, she teaches piano lessons, sings, writes, and plays the guitar. Joanna teaches in her spare time, and hopes that one day she will have plenty of time to play the piano. Joanna’s books are available from all good bookshops.","Joanna MacGregor plays the piano for the famous San Francisco Philharmonic Orchestra, a job that she takes seriously - her schedule is full, but, after one rehearsal, she decides to write a series of books for young children. She has been a concert pianist for over 30 years, performing regularly at major festivals around the world, including the Boston Pops and the Sydney Opera House. She has also toured with a number of soloists, including Sir John Eliot Gardiner. Joanna’s latest book, ‘Joanna’s Lessons’, was published this summer and combines her career as a concert pianist and her work as a teacher. In this book, Joanna gives a variety of lessons to young children, including singing and singing with the dj, and the book ends with a concert that showcases Joanna’s skills.","Joanna MacGregor loves to play the piano, but she has never thought about teaching people how to do it. Her students look up to her, and she is excited to share her knowledge with them. In Joanna’s Lessons, we get to see how Joanna deals with all her students in a manner that is both kind and challenging. The first lesson begins with a hiccup. Joanna is trying to play a piece, but has trouble using both hands. She then comes up with a plan that solves the problem and the lesson gets off to a great start!","It seems that all Joanna’s students have one thing in common: they want to learn to play the piano. The only difference is that she does it using words rather than music notes. In this book, she explains the techniques of a number of famous pianists. In Chapter 1, Joanna gives advice on selecting a piano for a child. She gives examples for all the various levels. In Chapter 2, she discusses playing the bassoon in a group. In Chapter 3, Joanna offers advice on finger placement. In Chapter 4, Joanna gives suggestions on reading music notation. In Chapter 5, Joanna introduces a variety of musical instruments that include the flute, violin, double bass, cello and clarinet. In Chapter 6, Joanna discusses the use of different musical instruments. She ends the book with a message that may apply to other musical instruments."
C2,"As I finished my second draft of this script, I realized that I had in fact made the same point as the main character. There was no more need for a series of scenes that were either unnecessary or superfluous. However, the story that unfolds within that frame remains relevant. For a moment, at least, as it plays out within the context of the film. I thought about what a good directing choice this is. I wanted it to be the culmination of his life’s events. In the same way that a story that plays out between a couple with one happy ending and the other tragic ending becomes its own form of ending, there could be other ways of looking at a scene, and letting it work for multiple purposes. In fact, perhaps I could have made that scene even more evocative than it originally was. Is there an element that makes this scene more meaningful? For example, if a story doesn’t move the viewers into the present, then perhaps a series of shots will do. This scene can lead to a series of scenes, the last one being the last we see of the main character. Perhaps, as a final shot, the story could be told in a sequence of photographs, an action shot or a single image. If, after this final shot, the scene turns into a montage of pictures, would the audience have a different interpretation of the sequence? If they do, I’ve given them a reason to be blown away by their own imagination. Alternatively, it could lead us to another story altogether.",The man with the big dog on his shoulder is getting ready for a race. It would be a good idea to go back and watch the race to make sure all the details are correct before rearranging the race. It wouldn't be that bad if I were the announcer. I would make sure all the other details were right. I would say some things are a little unclear but not all. I would say the horse had gone too fast but I think that was a little unnecessary.,"I had been looking at a number of movies lately, and especially loved The Shape of Water by William Shakespeare. The book has a stout lead character, whose narration I could easily replace with a narrator, and so I adapted that, as well. My favourite scene was when the girl asks Tom if he knew he had lost his temper with the girls father. She replies with, “Yes.” I was thinking of the two men, Tom and Sam, who have been estranged since their youth, and the fact that Sam is a teacher in a school for the visually impaired. They have a scene where Sam explains that he has been a bad teacher for his pupils for many years, but there is also one where he takes a moment to calm down with a small dog, or to give Tom a little hug. And so, like a painter would. The picture of the two girls. The boy and girl. The dog and the boy. They just are. And, even more shockingly, Tom explains that he is a great poet. What do you think of the film? How do you interpret the novel’s style and content, and why? In a postscript on Instagram, I wrote, “[The book] has been translated for the screen and there are some things that I liked and felt that had to be left in.” It is true that there was a lot of dialogue in the novel, but I think it had to do with a very specific tone of voice. I have some pictures to show which I like but for now they don’t seem to be in the movie. As I think about it, the tone can be quite subtle, with all too many details that become distracting or irrelevant.","The original book I read back in the summer of '97 was by the bestselling author Robert A. Heinlein. It is one of my favorites of all his books and in fact has been on my ""must read"" list for several years. A few weeks back I decided to look for a few examples of his writing. One of the examples that came to mind was an abridged version of The Stranger Is Here. A few months ago I got the chance to read the excerpt from it and I had to read it again before starting work on my first draft. The excerpt that interested me most was an old letter that I had found in a drawer and was deciding which way to go in my adaptation. I wanted it to read like this: I got a copy of The Stranger Is Here by Robert A. Heinlein and I read it in one sitting. I liked it. I wondered if it could be improved. I could see the book was about a young couple and a young girl. But I could also see the difference in the two. The book gave the woman a life and the man a future, and these changes would need to be reflected in the script. One thing I thought would be important to include was some of the historical detail, like how the people who lived during the time the story takes place were named. Also the setting. Is it really a small town in the countryside? Can it be a small town in the United States? The book could be written in an easy English voice, and the author could still make sense of it.","The scene in the script above was based on chapter 2 of The Book Thief by William Faulkner. I was quite certain I could dredge up the same sort of action. I rewrote the scenes in the script based on a conversation I had with a friend who also wrote the book and it was a real relief to find that the dialogue was still there and it worked very well. The main character of the book, the character of Mr. Wrong, was Mr. Gleeson. He is a small person of unknown appearance - the same kind of person one would come across in a real life courtroom situation. The main difference between the two was the kind of speech I had to dispense with, I ended up re-writing most of the dialogue from the novel into the script. We also went back over some of the scenes that I thought were good, I was struck by how much dialogue I could re-write to get the same outcome. In the beginning Mr. Gleeson was quite self-centered, as his personality tends to be. In the final scene we get a little bit more of him - I did not want to remove him completely because I felt he had the potential to have a great impact if he was left for some time to develop but I wanted to show the development of his character and the journey he was on at the end of the book. I also wanted to show that he was a good character as I thought he could grow as a person. It’s always interesting to try to work out how much can be adapted.","Every Picture Tells a Story. An adaptation of Janet Evanovich’s novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, this one is a series of photographs, some taken by a single photographer, some by two, and some by several. The photographs are like a treasure map, each in turn telling the story of a man, his life, his relationships, and his journey towards happiness.",Every Picture Tells a Story Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer but also illuminating. Working on a script I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with while still getting across the same point.
C2,"Global warming is a term used to describe changes in the Earth’s climate that are happening because of greenhouse gases that are being released into the atmosphere. Currently global warming is about 1.0°C per century. That means that by the year 2100, the planet will warm by 1.0°C, or two degrees. But the effects of global warming are just one piece of the puzzle. The global climate changes will also mean changes to human activities and to wildlife. Because plants and animals that were affected by global warming will have to adapt to the new conditions, their migrations and other species will have to alter in order to survive. Global warming will also mean higher sea levels and lower sea levels in the ocean, which will cause coral reefs to die off and a whole range of other marine life to disappear. It’s up to us to make our lives as comfortable and comfortable as possible in the face of these changes. To help us, we’ve compiled a list of ways that we can reduce our carbon footprint in order to reduce our impact on the climate.","The climate has warmed up due to manmade global warming. But it has also warmed the planet. Earth’s surface has warmed so much that the climate has warmed by an average of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the last 100 years. That’s a lot of heat. But what’s worse, many parts of the earth are already getting warmer because of the rising sea level. That raises the question: what could the new warming climate mean for humans?","Global warming has been a hysterical topic in the news for some time now and no one wants to get too far ahead of ourselves. It is thought that humans may have contributed to much of the increase in global temperatures since the start of the 20th century. Some of the main theories that have been proposed include human-caused greenhouse gas emissions that are now causing temperatures to increase and human-caused climate change. The idea that global warming is a major cause of climate change is supported by a number of global climate change models, many of which are used in scientific research. For example, in one model, the atmosphere over most parts of the world will warm up by an average of 0.7 degrees Celsius by 2100. That’s a difference of about 2 degrees Celsius between the present temperature and the climate in 1800. And this temperature change could have a number of effects on the weather. For example, the amount of rain falling around the world has already increased by 0.4 degrees Celsius since then. Scientists predict that the climate over the next 20 years will be much hotter. But the models also indicate that even if we’re lucky enough to be able to mitigate the effects of global warming, warming will still be felt in areas that already have high levels of greenhouse gases. For instance, climate change may cause droughts in the deserts of Africa, which are already suffering from a drop in rainfall. On the other hand, climate change could result in colder temperatures for certain parts of the world, such as Siberia, which gets an average of five to six snow days a year. The scientists don’t know just how much warming is likely and they are not sure what will happen to the Earth’s climate in the future. But the models predict that we could end up with a warmer climate within the next few hundred years than we have now, although some say we may not see it.","Global warming is one of the big questions of our times. Scientists are trying to understand how to deal with it. For example, some scientists say it might take a century to see a substantial decrease in global temperatures. In other words, it might take two to three millennia, say a few years. But what they don’t know yet is how far that will happen. If everything goes according to plan, there might be little change in the climate. In other words, climate change might not seem like such a big deal, and it might not affect people too much. There are even some scientists who think climate change is a problem, because their studies say that it can make hurricanes and heat waves more common. Scientists think it will also affect snow on the plains and even rain on the ocean, which is important in preventing storms.",The heat is on.,"The world has been on a steady downward spiral for years. Scientists have determined that more and more greenhouse gases will be releasing into the atmosphere each year. Because of this, we are threatening our planet’s fragile climate. What effect will global warming have on our lives and our world? What can we do to help save the planet from dangerous climate change? Scientists say that we can help slow down the rate of global warming by protecting our planet and trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There are a number of ways we can help. We can plant trees, make sure that we limit our carbon footprint, reduce our consumption of goods and services, and turn our homes into climate-controlled buildings.",The heat is on.

C2,"A man who lived to be 94 and whose spirit lives on with the people he worked for is a much sought-after hero for American executives, who admire his honesty and commitment. Britain’s Prime Minister, Theresa May, was inspired by Sir Ernest Shackleton during a visit to the U.S. last week. It’s an example of how the Shackleton of old, from the English Victorian era, is still relevant, explains the Daily Mail. Britain’s first polar expedition was led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, a lifelong admirer of British explorers. But the polar explorer’s life is far from finished. In 1925 he set out from South Georgia Island on a 1,500-mile journey that involved rafts, tents and a group of eight men. The expedition’s first polar landing, on Jan. 4, 1912, ended in disaster. Shackleton, on the lead, slew his polar bear and was killed in the process. Britain had no way of knowing he was still alive at the time of his death in 1921. “I remember I woke up one morning to find a sea-ice bridge about 300 yards across, and it was melted off,” he told the Daily Mail. Britain’s first polar expedition was led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, a lifelong admirer of British explorers. But the polar explorer’s life is far from finished. In 1925, he set out from South Georgia Island on a 1,500-mile journey that involved rafts, tents and a group of eight men. The expedition’s first polar landing, on Jan. 4, 1912, ended in disaster.

In 1925, he set out from South Georgia Island on a 1,500-mile journey that involved rafts, tents and a group of eight men. The expedition’s first polar landing, on Jan. 4, 1912, ended in disaster. The explorer’s life was long lived; his sons, Sir Ronald and Sir Ernest, are now polar explorers and adventurers. His book “Early Man: An Autobiography” has sold more than 100 million copies. The book also inspired the 2012 film about Shackleton, “In Search of Shackleton”. The book’s lead author, Professor David Allen, describes how Shackleton approached Antarctic exploration. “The Arctic has some of the most polarised places on Earth. This is where so many Americans and Brits can find themselves,” Allen told the Telegraph. He also noted that Shackleton was well-known in both parts of the world. His biography, titled “Shackleton: The Heroic and Unsung Hero” was adapted into a stage play in London. Shackleton’s Antarctic expeditions were the largest of all time and involved the greatest challenge of all time: conquering the North Pole in a winter where temperatures were as low as -78F, making for a deadly environment. The expeditions sailed from Chile’s South Shetland Islands in 1909, navigating through polar waters in a time when ships rarely used navigation aids. The story of his journey through the Antarctic wilderness, as told in the 2008 documentary “In Search of Shackleton” was an incredibly emotional and personal account for Allen. In “In Search of Shackleton”, Allen describes how Shackleton faced dissenting groups when he made the journey to the South Shetland Islands. When some members of the team had mutinied, Shackleton chose to stay on and fight on until they rescued others. Although he survived, the expedition lost 20 men when it capsized and Shackleton was found dead in the ice. However, there were also those who found his actions “inspiring, sacrificial and just”. Although, he says, “there is a real value to seeing the world through a different lens”.","When a new documentary film about polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton comes out, he will be known as a model for good management. But that hasn’t stopped three American executives from looking to him as inspiration. American businessman Ben Goldacre, for instance, has taken it a step further, turning Shackleton’s exploits into a business lesson for executives. A documentary, Shackleton: The Inside Story, is set to launch this spring. It is produced by documentary film production company Blue Sky Studios, and is described by Goldacre as a three-week crash course in management techniques, complete with the story of a team-building session to show how to be team-based with your staff. The film, set in the Antarctic, tells the true story of how the Antarctic expedition of 1902 was scuttled by the prevailing winds, the cold and the danger. Shackleton, a former naval explorer who walked unassisted around the vast icebergs that mark the north and south poles, was the last known person to make it to the South Pole. The film follows Shackleton and his crew, who are buried at McMurdo Station on South Georgia Island in the South Shetlands, where they are on a search for the explorer’s ship. After their search, Shackleton and his crew are given a series of messages from the Lord Mayor of South Shetland in the Arctic region, warning them about dangerous winds, bad navigation and high seas. The film will be launched in April by io9, a New York-based marketing company based in California. In January, BSA, one of the main sponsoring organizations, asked American executives to nominate a person to give an executive business lesson. The executives voted for the polar explorer. One of the winning executives will be announced at an awards ceremony at the New York Academy of Music. Goldacre’s project is a collaboration between the documentary film, Blue Sky Studios, and the BSA. It is funded by the British Antarctic Survey and the National Geographic Society, while the film is directed by John Bingham and BSA is produced by Blue Sky Studios and BSA. Shackleton was born in 1841 in Antarctica, the last surviving British colony on Earth. He won an 1886 Pulitzer Prize for The Search for the South Pole. The film was released in 1977. The film has been adapted for the screen, with the opening scene in which Shackleton and his crew head off in search of a ship that has never been found. The expedition, aptly named The Search for Ernest Shackleton, is not without its problems. Shackleton and his crew have been stranded in an Arctic wilderness since, and the expedition was marred by a terrible storm that almost buried the ship. Eventually, the survivors and crew made it back to civilization. During the filming, the polar expedition’s crew members made a series of humorous remarks in front of a camera. Some of the wittiest lines were: “A boat like this is never going to be seen again”.","Americans have come to appreciate Sir Ernest Shackleton for his role as a polar explorer, a man whose courage and determination in the face of daunting odds paid off in many ways. The polar pioneer, the son of a British army officer, was a man who set himself apart from other explorers, and was a leader who knew how to work with others. A polar explorer, he was a people person who had a deep love of his country. “As you approach a new challenge, you need to recognise that people do come to your company for different reasons,” said Dr William L. Shackleton, the chairman of the British Antarctic Survey, which has a team of experts on the Shackleton expedition. “If you can put someone together who has not been to Antarctica, you will quickly learn that they have a natural ability to inspire others. “An example would be Sir Robert Falcon Scott, who has the ability to inspire thousands of people to achieve great things. Shackleton had a unique ability to get people together, and his ability to inspire was particularly apparent on his expeditions to Antarctica. He built his men into a strong team, and he was known for the way he treated people. He was also good with numbers. Shackleton made himself available as a guide when a problem occurred and, instead of saying something like, ‘We have a problem,’ he would say, ‘It is not easy to talk to people.' When a team member is not able to give good answers, he would say: “If you don’t have a solution that will get you to the next objective, then go to them and tell them what you think would be the best way to do it, and if they say yes, then you can get them to the next task. Dr Shackleton said that as someone who had an unusual aptitude for thinking logically, he was a great management example. “He was a man who was not afraid to stand up for what was right, to speak out and say that the way forward was the best path, even if it seemed impossible. He had a great appreciation of what was right but also of what was wrong. He could see the way forward, but he wanted to see the way that the problem could be solved and he listened to his team.","The famous Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, known as the man who invented the polar expedition, is helping America’s executives better manage the difficult and often challenging situations they face. In a TEDx Talk, the 69-year-old adventurer talks about his life. He talks about his approach to work, his personality, his work ethic and his morals. He tells of how he always put people before himself. His most famous moment is when he and his party reach the South Pole in 1913. “I didn’t think there was a more brave man,” Shackleton said at the time. Shackleton – the first person to circumnavigate the world on a ship – was the first person to be stranded at sea in the polar regions of the world. In 1913, while his party sailed from South Georgia to Antarctica, Shackleton spotted an iceberg, got out of the boat and climbed a crevasse and found it to be a crevasse in the sea. Two months later they arrived at Elephant Island, and the party decided to make a break for Antarctica. After their first night there, they found an iceberg, and made a camp in an underground tunnel. Shackleton told his party that they would leave after a week and try to return to Antarctica, but when they landed they found it was under ice and that there was no rescue craft. They stayed in tents in the cold snow for three days before making camp in a safe place. The day before going to Antarctica, they were awarded the medal for heroism at the International Polar Year. “Our team was so focused on the expedition itself. The team was focused on the challenges of getting us to the iceberg and back to the boat safely,” Shackleton told his group, including former polar explorer Sir Alan Jones. The expedition was a huge undertaking – all 3,000 people on board, many of them men – but it was a great feat of endurance. It took two men to pull the iceberg out of the sea and a total of 60 men to climb it in three months. Shackleton died from a heart attack on March 20 1927 – the day after they made it to the South Pole. The following day, they had to go back to the safety of Elephant Island. But when they first reached Elephant Island there was no news. They had been alone for more than six months without any contact with any ship or other humans. Then there was the iceberg. “I looked at it and there was nothing but ice on it. I just said ‘oh there’s no more ice.’ And they gave him a couple of minutes to get a lollipop.” The polar explorer was eventually awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain’s highest civilian honour for bravery and leadership. The TEDx talk comes on the 75th anniversary of Shackleton’s 1913 expedition – which lasted six months. “Shackleton’s adventure was an amazing feat – but the polar explorer wasn’t the first person to cross the Antarctic,” writes Eluned Price, a British expat living in the United States. The American Antarctic Survey (AAS) is trying to encourage more people to explore. A polar expedition is an adventurous ice expedition to which a group of scientists, led by a senior explorer, go on a journey to the South Pole to find the best route and best food in order to eat. The expedition was funded by the South Pole Conservancy. A couple of years ago, I read an article by a journalist on Antarctica which brought together a few accounts from Shackleton’s expedition. One included a detailed account of how, when he walked off the ship, he slashed down the ship’s bow. It was a disaster. There had been a number of reports from expeditions before. You don’t normally get a book on the expedition – they didn’t have an audio recording. And they had no photographs or video footage from the expedition. I remember reading about the food that Shackleton had served, but had no real idea what it had been like when he did it. The expedition had been launched by a British expedition to find a route to South Georgia. To do that the British Antarctic Survey had to go all the way around Antarctica. Shackleton had no idea where the food was. But there were photos. In the end, they were able to map out the route, making sure that they had the right fuel","It was Sir Ernest Shackleton who proved a true pioneer of leadership. American executives are reportedly praising the explorer for inspiring them to be better leaders. The pioneer was born and raised in South Africa and came to Britain aged 20. But he never lived in England and didn’t come to South Africa until 1924 when he found a job as a polar explorer with the RRS Discovery expedition. He worked as an ice breaker with the ship until he finally died in 1938 after falling into the Antarctic. Shackleton and his crew would work for almost 40 years before they were rescued by the icebreaker Fitzgerald, who returned to South America in 1907. Since then, he has become the most famous polar explorer, and has led more expeditions than any other person. Now his legacy is being passed down from generation to generation. In a recent LinkedIn post, British firm Allen & Overy has announced it is adopting Shackleton’s ideas as a model for management. The founder of the firm, Andrew Clark, wrote: “Shackleton was a great leader. He was an innovator. He always thought of people, what they needed and what they wanted, and he made sure the team understood that. He really led from the front. Shackleton believed that a team should be made up of experts who know their job, but also have a good sense of fun and a sense of adventure, so people get excited and enjoy themselves. “Today I think everyone should have that sense of humour. I also think he was a genius in his field as well as being brilliant a leader. He was a great leader and a great example to everyone else. His words have brought so much goodwill. His story is told around the world. Shackleton’s story could inspire business leaders to be more confident. He had an ego the size of the world and made himself look small. He was always at the top of his game with everyone and never let anyone get over him. He was always the best man for the job, and was respected by all. He had the courage to say that he was the only person who could do the job. He had a sense of humour that people respected and he was always friendly to everyone he met. He had a great team spirit and would often go the extra mile. His story will always be remembered and admired.","British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton was a charismatic and daring leader. A famous polar explorer with a reputation for being tough and courageous, he became a legend because he led teams of explorers on a daring expedition to the Antarctic.","The United States is embracing the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management, Eluned Price reports. American executives are adopting the Polar Explorer as a model for good management, she writes. They call him an explorer - because he went looking for an Antarctic expedition in 1907, when the sea was frozen over and it took three years for him to reach the South Pole. They say he managed to get himself out and his team back despite the perils of the extreme environment and even when the team made it back the trip was never completed. Sir Ernest worked as a surveyor for GlaxoSmithKline. ""He was a pioneer in the field of science and in Antarctica in particular. He understood the dangers of the extreme conditions in the polar regions and the need for strong leadership in difficult circumstances, with an uncompromising ability to maintain his composure and to remain positive. He was a people person and the fact that he worked under pressure as an expedition leader, he was not a loner, he would not sully the reputations of others. That is why he can be so admired by Americans today."""
C2,"As we move into a digital age we will continue to experience music through various media. The rise of the iPod a portable gadget which holds all our music - including digital downloads - means we can listen to music wherever we are. We listen to music on the commute, in our leisure time and as we work. It is essential that our lives are balanced and this will only be achieved if there is a good balance between the use of digital and traditional media. Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam examines how these advances will change our perception of music.","Technical advances continue to transform our lives at work, at home and in our leisure activities.",In the latter part of the 20th century we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio TV records tapes CDs videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. The music business faced a major challenge as the advent of these new technologies was likely to mean a shift in strategy to produce more new music. The technology that enabled the industry to launch a single artist in a week and a single artist with the same name with a limited number of music recordings has all closed.,The challenge ahead for music is to adapt to technological advances. Susan Hallam explains that music needs to keep up with the changes.,"The last century in music saw dramatic changes as the emergence of new technologies and ways of listening transformed the way in which music was produced and presented in the UK. For example, the popularity of the BBC's Top of the Pops programme which was based on a ""world music"" style of musical arrangements which straddled the genres of classical pop RnB and rock and roll in Britain, and included live broadcasts, became a major part of the cultural life of many people throughout Britain. The emergence of a music-based radio station based on BBC Radio 4 which began broadcasting in 1952 helped to broaden the reach of popular music. The introduction of the 'flash disc' in the 1960s saw a rapid decline in music albums and the use of cassettes for music recordings - something that subsequently caused the decline of cassettes as an important medium for recording. But even the most die-hard fan of the classics had to accept that some styles of music had died out in favour of other forms - especially folk music. Those that were still popular when the '80s came along were affected by the decline in album sales, with the exception of pop music which was still very popular during the '80s - for example in the UK pop music charts and by the Beatles' ""Come Together"". There are many reasons for the recent decline in popularity of rock music (and in many other genres of music) including the reluctance of listeners to listen to live performances of popular music, or the difficulty of organising concerts and tours with the aid of online services, which were not developed until relatively recently. In contrast, pop music is still an important part of the cultural life of many communities, even after the death of Elvis Presley. Despite the emergence of new technology it has remained firmly fixed in musical culture. To a large extent the rapid rise in digitisation of the music industry in recent years has made it virtually impossible for an artist to maintain a physical presence. A lot of electronic music was first made available for consumers in cassette and CD formats, which enabled the user to re-live many of the popular music charts and festivals from the last fifty years. Although many people were aware of this new form of listening, most people did not realise that it would lead to a number of new forms and trends. This may be something of a surprise since many pop stars - such as Elton John - are now in their 60s or 70s. In recent years a growing number of people have begun to find it difficult to stay connected to their favorite music when they leave the house for work or play, and they also tend to avoid social networking sites in favour of more sedentary activities. Despite these changes, some people still enjoy listening to their own music, although they sometimes turn to online music services for their favourite songs. This trend will continue in the future with music becoming increasingly popular on social media, both in the UK and worldwide.","I feel that this story is about the way music is changing. Today we have more opportunities to listen to music than ever before, yet some critics still seem unhappy about this. Susan Hallam is a music critic for The Guardian. She says that ""in the past there has been a tendency for the record companies to focus too much on what has made money for them, while at the same time leaving the public wanting more.""",Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities.

C2,Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books – joys that are of course intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago and in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people.,"In summer, there is no shortage of holiday reading, either at home or on vacation. During vacation, we get the opportunity to read books by ourselves, or in a group, and our friends and family can also join in the reading. It is a time to get away from the noise and distractions of day-to-day life, for the purpose of finding a quiet, peaceful place for ourselves. In most of these places, we can choose books about fantasy and adventure. We can also learn about mythology and history. While travelling in the country, we can also visit some of the famous sights that are scattered around the world. In such a magical place as the desert, we can read about the most spectacular sight of all, the Sphinx. Our friends at the library can also suggest great books for us to read. However, sometimes it is better to leave the books at home. At our favourite café, the bookshop and café, we can enjoy a great read under the sun. In this cafe, we can find books that offer some of the best books written in the English language. We can also pick up books that are written in other languages, such as German. Books that are in German are called “Deutsche Bücher”, while books in English are called “English Books”. The first books that we read on holiday are the best ones that have been published in English. They offer the opportunity to escape home and escape the responsibilities and concerns of everyday life. They offer time to reflect on ourselves, the things we are grateful for and our hopes for the future. Books are also a source of comfort, whether at home or away from home. It may be true, for example, that reading books helps one to overcome feelings of loneliness or isolation. However, we must be careful about choosing books that have been written in English. If we are not careful, reading books can be dangerous. It is easy to become disorientated by the language and may not fully understand the message that the book is trying to convey. Therefore, our best bet is to choose books in English so that our mind will be clear on what the message is.","The sun is shining in a warm yellow blaze. The leaves have started to fall on the trees. The sun kisses my face. The grass seems brighter too. My bookbag is full with books. I take them along everywhere I go. Books I love, books I will read again and again. These are my bookish holidays. Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that of course are intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago and in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. And books, whether we are reading about people or places, can transport us into other times. I love reading of all kinds – the adventure, the romance, the love story. In fact, I never know what to read next. I usually get a new author to tell me about. I’m not a good escapist. My mind is always blown and I find myself drifting off into another world. Books are my escape. One of my favourite books is The Magician’s Nephew by H.G. Wells. It’s about a British spy whose world is turned upside down when he’s sent to investigate the murder of a Russian spy, the son of a powerful aristocrat. It was first published in 1817, but it was only in 1826 that it was made into a film, and now it is a TV series. Its central character is a young man, a former spy. He finds himself surrounded by a bunch of girls with whom he is falling in love; he loves them and hates them. He can’t stop falling in love, though. His name is Michael Morpurgo, and he is always on the lookout for women to seduce; in particular, he loves women who are hot-tempered and aggressive. The first time he meets an attractive woman, he finds his mind blown when he realizes she’s a spy who’s been sent to investigate the murders of a couple of Russian spy agents. It’s then that he realizes that he is also a spy. He sets out to find the people behind the ring and to bring them to justice. His mission is a success when he realizes that one of the men, and one of the girls, is his partner, and he has his heart set on finding out whether she can be trusted. After all, the whole of Russia is governed by an absolute monarch, and the fact that he was a spy and an intelligence officer is a big reason that he’s so attractive. So Michael Morpurgo ends up with a job as a police officer and has a life filled with danger and pleasure. He loves the city. I love London too. I love visiting parks, museums and the London Eye. There’s something about the London Eye that fascinates me. I know London is beautiful, but it’s just that I’m missing the atmosphere. I’ve seen the city from so many different angles, but I’ve never felt so trapped by a city as I did in The Magician’s Nephew. London’s eerie and sinister, almost in its own way, is hard to shake. It’s hard not to feel like your heart is pulsing against the marble floor as you read. There’s this feeling of being a spy and spy and being an insider in a foreign place, all wrapped into one moment of life, when you’re on the train and the light is changing. But it’s not the feeling that matters most, it’s the memories of the place that matter most. The memories will take you down memory lane when you come back to it. The memories of the place, the people, the places... They become our memories. And it’s those memories that we hold onto and cherish. Then when we get home, we get to decide whether we want to stay or go home. We can decide if it’s worth the travel for us to go home.","As we pack our bags, we begin thinking about some of the books that we have yet to read and whether or not they would be appropriate for a holiday. The children are excited to start the holidays and their favourites are beginning to look increasingly interesting.","What are some ways that a holiday is a great chance to escape? As I think about this I remember my last summer abroad as a teenager in Japan and the excitement of discovering new places, new foods, new languages and new adventures. I remember my parents saying we should all go off and be different, to escape our own narrow world for some time. For me, that meant taking a bus to a foreign country, discovering an entirely new culture and language, and reading a great book. This year, after all these years, the holiday is the most important thing for me so far: the chance to finally take a big risk, to go somewhere new and unexpected and to just let go and enjoy it! So, on this Summer’s Day, I am excited. I have chosen to try a new way of travelling by train instead of car. I am going to a nearby train station that will take me to a new city that will be a couple of hours away. Whenever I open the train ticket ticket it will say “Japan” on it. I will take a train to a city I have never been to before and take the train to a station that is only a couple of blocks away. I will take the train to a station I have never been to before. Before taking the train, I will look for a book at the book stand. I will get a book and start reading. This could be for several reasons: I want to find out more about the country I am going to and discover what it was like to live there many years ago. I want to visit the city or even walk up to the nearby tower. I want to go to a market that would allow me to see the food and experience the different cultures in the city. I want to try some of the local foods that I have heard of and try to prepare something like the gyoza soup I had in Kyoto in 2012. I will look into ancient culture and history. I am also excited about reading a great book. I have decided that I have to try to read in a language that has not been studied before. I decided to try French and English. I will read different stories and see how I can make them sound better in French.",Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are of course intimately connected.

C2,"We often talk about art versus reality. A lot of people look at art as something that allows them to view the world through a certain lens. Yet we often fail to think of art as a process of discovery. Art versus reality can be understood as an experience of self-discovery and the artist's interaction with the creative process. As artists we must have the creative imagination but we can't see it directly. It is important to ask ourselves, where does a photograph come from? What influences the creative process of the artist?","Photography is a medium where people capture, preserve, and reflect visual information that is specific to them or their surroundings.","Photographer Robert Capa was known for creating beautiful photos that reflected the artist’s ideas. His photographs reveal a complex mixture of both his technical and aesthetic skills. His personal views and experiences are visible in his photographs. Capa is an artist who uses the camera to reveal and express his ideas, and he is fascinated with the aesthetics of photography. His current focus lies on photographing architecture. Capa often uses multiple lenses and filters to capture images that combine different styles and angles.","Photography when a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience together with a set of social and cultural norms.","Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience together with a set of social and cultural norms.

C2,"The driver’s side window was a bit smashed so I climbed out and headed to the window and saw that my father had just placed his phone back on the windscreen. ‘Dad it’s no good!’ I yelled. ‘What happened to my phone? It was obviously taken while we were on our way back and I doubt it was even occupied. I looked up in time to see my father spitting onto the windscreen. He took the phone out of his pocket and emptied his drink. I don’t remember exactly where I put it, but I can’t recall ever having it taken out.’ ‘Look here it’s no good!’ yelled my father. ‘What happened to my phone?

It was stolen.’","he had never seen the pleading face of the boy who had suddenly grown so ugly and fat. he was still on the phone, pleading with her to change the washing machine. ”Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. My father had put a large heavy metal tin on top of the broken, tattered old bed frame. He said that, “It will make the bed more comfortable”. And then, with a smile, he lifted the bed up revealing the bed beneath. I looked down at the bottom of the bed, where a very old stuffed toy elephant was lying, dead. I looked at Maurice. He was a snooty child and looked away from me. Then, he said, ‘Look here it’s no good!’ He pulled the rug up so that the elephant was out of the way. “That’s a bit of a shame, Maurice. It won’t stop Maurice stealing stuff, though,’ I said. But Maurice looked back at me, then up at me and said, “And that’s a tad unfair!” Maurice laughed.","I sighed. I thought about this. What if I were to tell my parents that I’d stolen that watch from their wardrobe. They would be furious. It was a really big watch and it was certainly a fine watch. The watch was very expensive. It was a real one and it was also worth every penny! I hadn’t been able to afford it. If I had, I’d have had to go to the jewellers to have it repaired. Instead, my father had just stolen it from my trunk. This made it even more of a shame for me to bring it home. Maurice had been so happy about his new watch that he had taken the watch as well as my father. I wasn’t upset about Maurice taking the watch because Maurice didn’t do anything rash. He just wanted to see my watch. He did have a lot of other things on his mind though. First of all, he wanted to buy a present for his girlfriend. He had just bought a new pair of jeans from a new shop in his local market. He also had his eye on a new watch, but he didn’t want to let my father know about it. ‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. This turned Maurice’s eyes to gold. I couldn’t tell him that he had just stolen it and he still looked surprised. He was so proud. He hadn’t realised that he had stolen the watch and I was so proud of him. It was an incredible feeling. I wanted to tell my parents the truth. I didn’t want to tell Maurice the truth or that my dad stole the watch. In fact, I didn’t want to tell them the truth at all because I was so proud of Maurice. Honestly, it was one of the best nights I had in a long time. Now I think back to that afternoon and the night my family became my own, so much so that they had to sell their home to move into a new one. I wasn’t sure where to turn. I was going to have to be strong. This was one of those nights where you needed to be smart and sassy. I deserved it.","It was a clumsy idea! My Dad thought for a moment, ‘We’ve been there.’ So he looked back up at me with a smile, ‘And what do you mean it’s no good?’ I asked. He smiled back, then said ‘I told Maurice I want a new bag,’ Maurice said. He had no idea what I meant, but was happy that he had a new bag!","‘Look here it’s no good!’ said my Dad. ‘Why, you can’t see it?’ said my brother Maurice, unwrapping a brown, brown parcel. ‘It’s a book!’ said my dad. ‘It’s a book about animals.’ I replied. ‘That is exactly what I’m looking for.’ My father said, ‘but there’s a naughty boy in here,’ and he closed the parcel, saying ‘Mrs. Barclay has been told.’ Maurice’s eyes widened as he tried to comprehend, before he could answer. Then he continued: ‘It’s a book about animals.’ My father looked around the car to see if the boy was Mr. Barclay. ‘He’s sacked.’ Maurice continued: ‘I didn’t know that.’ My father said, ‘He might well be the boy’s father.’ My dad looked at Maurice and said, ‘So you’re not the boy’s father after all.’ My dad looked at Maurice and said, ‘Well, there’s a possibility.’ My father looked around again and said, ‘Look here it’s no good!’ ‘You are right.’ Maurice muttered. He looked up in my father’s eyes. ‘What do you mean it’s no good?’ I asked, ‘No he isn’t. He’s a boy.’ My father said, ‘We’re all family.’","“Yes sir” he said. We reached home and Maurice got off his bike to wash his hands. ‘What do you mean it’s no good?’ my Dad asked. ‘Look here it’s no good!’ Maurice told me. Maurice had noticed a rusty nail sticking out of the tyre. It was the nail he wanted to remove. Maurice looked at my father who sighed. ‘Look here it’s no good!’ My father asked. ‘It’s no good!’ said my father. Maurice was worried that he was going to get a job selling nails. He leaned his head forward and said, ‘Look here it’s no good!’","” ” I said. ‘Oh no, you’ve got it right!’ “You are right” Maurice said. ‘The school has changed so I can’t take it with me.’ “I’m afraid it’s no good.” Maurice was furious. I’m not really sure why. Maurice has only been to the posh girls’ school for a week. He was never in the same class as me and he is hardly the kind of kid to take a tumble down a rabbit hole. We got back to the school and I went through my things one last time. I looked in my suitcase and it was empty. Maurice went off to get his shoes and when he came back I handed him my suitcase with no shoes in it. “It doesn’t look like the school threw the clothes in, does it?” I asked."

To relax in the evening residents stroll down the city streets and if you join them you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. Vancouver is a city where everyone seems to speak a different language, and in the first few years, people have taken to using several different idioms of English. For example, ""Hello"" is a word for hello in many languages. And most Canadians think ""I like you"" is a good way to say hello. Another example: ""I am so very sorry that you made such a big mistake. I could not have been more clear with you."" ""Hello"" has a whole lot of different meanings, depending on the culture and country where it was said. In many places, it simply means 'hello.' For example, in Canada, it could refer to a person, an animal, or a place. For example, ""I am so sorry for letting you down."" There are many languages spoken in Vancouver. For example, ""Hello"" is not just one language. It can refer to a whole group of people speaking a single language or dialect. ""Hi"" means ""goodbye"" in many languages. For example, ""hello"" can refer to someone, a place, or a message. For example, ""hi"" can refer to a family member or a friend. This can refer to something that is spoken together, such as ""hello,"" in some languages. For example, ""hello"" can refer to someone saying ""how are you?"" in another language. The most commonly used ""hello"" (as used in North America) is ""Hello"". So, it is easy to see that different people have different meanings of ""hello."" The British English dictionary has two common meanings: ""Goodbye"" and ""Hello."" The British English dictionary gives the meaning ""hello"" in two different ways: either ""excuse me"" or ""remind me."" The British English dictionary provides two different meanings of ""goodbye"": ""Remind me"" (a person does not say ""goodbye""), or ""I miss you"". The British English dictionary also gives the meaning ""remind me"" in two different ways: either ""remind me"" or ""remind me"" (which indicates that the speaker does not say ""goodbye""), or ""I don't know you"". The British English dictionary gives the meaning ""hello"" in two different ways: either ""excuse me"" or ""remind me"" (which states that the speaker does not say ""goodbye"". For example, ""I need some time off!"" can refer to something as simple as ""I need to go for a drive"". For example, ""Let's go for a walk"". Or ""Let's go on an adventure!"" can refer to something as simple as ""Let's go on an adventure"". ""Remember to keep your friends close"" can refer to someone who is not currently in your immediate group of friends.","Last month I enjoyed a stroll along Robson Street. I spoke to a man I knew from my village in Ecuador. It was summertime and he told me he is leaving the country, leaving his wife and four children behind to pursue a life in Canada, and that he had been looking for work for a couple of years. It was a busy street and he wanted to find out how easy it would be to get around Vancouver. He had only just completed an undergraduate degree at UBC and was living in Vancouver. He spoke excellent English and so I asked him a lot of questions. First of all, where are you from? I explained that I was born in Ecuador and I arrived in Vancouver just a few months ago. He didn’t seem at all surprised. He was proud of his country, even though he said he had not seen much of his homeland. As he grew older, his wife and children became more involved in his country, even though he still speaks little English. He added that he also learned how to speak Spanish and Portuguese, but he did not speak French. I explained that I thought I knew the majority of the languages spoken in Vancouver. He was very impressed, but said that he hadn’t been to Brazil or South Africa. This surprised me and I explained that I was interested in living there and he said that he had always wanted to live in Australia. He said that he planned to take an English class next year to learn more about Australian English. If he enjoyed the class, he said he wanted to return to Canada one day. I thought he was quite funny because he speaks Spanish and Portuguese at the same time as English. When I asked him what languages he spoke, he said that he didn’t know English, Brazilian Portuguese, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Greek and English. I asked him how he came to know about all the languages in Vancouver. He said he came to live in Canada ten years ago and was trying to learn as many languages as possible in order to learn more and improve his English. He said that he had only studied in Spain. Luckily, he also learnt French and Portuguese, so he was able to continue to speak the two languages he had learned. I said that I had learned English and Portuguese in university but I wanted to learn the other languages in order to take English as a second language. He said that he had not been in Canada for a long time and therefore didn’t know many of the languages. He asked me if I knew Chinese, and I said I knew quite a lot about Chinese. He said that he had taken English at university because his parents were Canadians and he knew that China was the world’s largest producer of gold. He said that Chinese was more interesting than English for many reasons, especially because there are several languages which sound similar. He said that English also sounds very similar to Chinese, but that he did not think it was particularly important as he had never taken up that language. He then said that Chinese is the dominant language in Vancouver but that he was only interested in the language because he had heard it spoken by native people. He drank tea and told stories about the people who lived in Vancouver. To learn more about Vancouver, you can find it on their website.","You can't stop thinking about the people here.

C2,"If I have any experience of opera I would say it would be more like opera than musical theatre. Musical theatre is theatre that is not based on music. There is no dance in opera because dance is simply not part of opera’s fabric. And dance, unlike opera, is not the result of the work of musicians. Instead, it is the product of the imagination. That is why musical theatre is so great. Music creates and supports art. And that is why it matters more than theatre for art.",This story was created using the Writer’s Voice application by the author.,"I will say this. The music comes first. That’s as it should be of course. I like to sing and I like to listen to music. In fact, I prefer listening to music. Especially when I’m at home in my room. When I was in the National Opera house a while ago, I was sitting in an auditorium with only three seats – three rows to my right, three rows to my left, and three rows in front of me. I heard music coming out of an amplifier and my mind was blown. It was completely different from the way I used to imagine it when I was young. I could listen to a piece for two hours at most. I remember the feeling of ecstasy when I started singing. It was like I could do something out of nothing. There is no other word for that feeling. It’s different to anything else you’ve ever felt before. That was until I moved to Italy. I was blown away. The quality of the music I heard there was extraordinary. I felt like I was being transported to another planet. I could almost imagine the characters and the plot in the opera house. The sound quality was like something from another planet. The tempo of the music was like nothing I’d heard before. The tempo of the music was faster, the instruments were so much bigger. I thought that I had heard a dream. But I realised that my imagination was not my imagination. I had heard the music and I believed it. My imagination just could not believe that I was hearing the music I was hearing. I was wrong. It’s not really like music to have an ethereal quality. The tempo of the music is quite a different matter. I remember one time when I was in Italy and I saw an opera. I was at the foot of the stage and I was at the point when the orchestra played the first piece of music and then the orchestra played something else. The tempo of the music was just too fast for me to believe it. I kept on listening to the music and I knew I was hearing the tempo. When I got back to my room I had been listening to a piece that was sung by a very famous opera singer. When he sang it I felt like I was in a different world and that the music was very different and I was transported back to my imagination. I had been back to my imagination and now it was real. It was as if the music in my imagination was actually happening. It was almost like it was written to music. There was no stage set, no sound effects, no lighting, just music. It really was the music and I couldn’t believe that this was the real thing. I was back in the music room when I heard someone singing an entire opera. I couldn’t believe it, but it was true. There was no stage set, no sound effects, no lighting, no light. Only the music. There were no lights, no sound effects, no sets, no anything. It was all just music.",MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more.

C2,"Broadcasting originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. On March 16, 1950, in Chicago, a swarm of media zealots had the nerve to make a speech calling for government interference in news broadcasting, calling for ""the removal of the government from the process of making news broadcasts,"" a ""deliberate attempt to make the private ownership of the broadcast medium less relevant."" Suddenly, as many as 10 million people tuned into the radio, if they wanted to hear these zealots rant about the government, the politicians would simply broadcast their complaints about the way the government did business to everyone listening on the radio. Radio broadcasting became a vehicle for expressing a host of anti-government and anti-freedom sentiments, from racial tensions to civil rights, and was quickly regarded by some Americans as a stumbling block to their freedom of speech. The resulting media frenzy led to a new social crisis, one of unintentionally over-zealous censorship. While the broadcast-eating public is well aware of the negatives of ""broadcasting,"" they are only just beginning to understand the benefits of it. The growth of free speech, the growth of civil rights, and the growth of personal expression and expression of opinions has all benefited from radio. The rebirth of radio was an act of self-consciousness, of recognition of a shared responsibility for the outcome of human interaction, and ultimately of democracy itself. Like any new invention, radio broadcasting had many ups and downs, but also many significant gains and losses. The new technologies that enabled broadcasting include wireless communication, telephony, radio, and the Internet. These technologies and the many benefits they brought have greatly changed human communication. The advent of television, one of the first broadcasting technology and one of the first to make its appearance, has made television an important part of our everyday life, and is, in many ways, the catalyst that has most reshaped our society.","Broadcasting, originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is, in other words, not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest.","At the dawn of the new medium the broadcasting company was not a state institution. Instead it was a private enterprise owned by the owner or operator. But this also made broadcasting a powerful institution. Broadcasting allowed the population to hear news and views about the latest developments in public affairs, business, science, art and science. The state, however, only controlled the public broadcaster. So how did it come about that broadcasting became more and more indistinguishable from mass media? The answer was partly by way of an inexorable shift in media culture in which both the news and the political information were manipulated. And as more and more information came into public view, the press and broadcasters began to play a much larger role. That is why the media owe their beginnings to the political messages uttered by the politicians. But the real power of the medium lay in its ability to reach a wider population at relatively low cost. The idea of broadcasting, in turn, became deeply ingrained in people's minds. And by combining the two, broadcasting developed a special place in popular culture. Eventually it began to be used to speak as a way of life. Television broadcasting was born in 1950. And so television began to be used to talk about the latest news and events. A TV audience, in turn, was created to watch TV coverage. The BBC, for example, soon realised the potential of tele-vision. It had the idea that TV programmes could be seen and heard on televisions, while radio shows could be heard on radios or on TVs themselves. Initially it was a success, but it soon became too expensive and inconvenient for mass distribution. This forced broadcasting firms to look elsewhere. Television broadcasting also became a way of broadcasting information to a wider audience, often a much wider audience than those with whom it was intended to be shared. As radio technology developed, it was argued, it became less effective than broadcasting, but became ever-larger, so the number of people able to hear it, as well as the amount of time spent watching it, increased dramatically. Television began to be used to announce changes in the political affairs of the country, to provide information in times when government policy seemed to be shifting away from public service broadcasting. And so broadcasting began to be used to deliver news and opinions, but not to deliver information. Until recently, it was this social aspect that had not been accounted for. But television has the capacity to convey news in a far wider arena that radio could not, and it is therefore the technology that has become more effective and more important.","Broadcasting originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor, it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. This is an excerpt of a report produced by the Center for Public Integrity.","Broadcasting was originally sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is, in other words, not only an agricultural metaphor but it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, and the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. This is the story of the emergence of the radio in the United Kingdom in 1945. It is set in a world where broadcasting was the defining feature of the modern state and the main activity of radio broadcasters. This article looks at how a technology whose genesis, a technology developed by the BBC, led to the introduction of the BBC's first radio station on 22 May 1946 in London. This led to an explosion of interest from all walks of life and into all kinds of different markets: it could be used by telecommunications companies to create a network for telephony, it could be used by the post office to provide delivery services for parcels, the post office to deliver packages to the home, the post office to send and receive mails in remote parts of the world. It was also used by some politicians to promote their political agendas and as a tool for promoting their own political party. As the technology continued to develop there was a lot of new people interested in its development and by the 1950s radio was used by the Government to 'broadcast' news across the country, to create its first newspaper, the Daily Express, and to create radio dramas. Throughout the 1950s a wide variety of people, including politicians and businessmen, had started to take an interest in radio and, to a lesser extent, in radio broadcasting itself. At this time, more than half of the people in England had an interest in the radio, the BBC was gaining in popularity, and it was also receiving considerable royal patronage. During this time radio and broadcasting began to be seen as the basis of a national cultural and educational development. During World War II, broadcasting became a key part of the war effort and was recognised as being indispensable to the victory in the war. At the time, radio broadcasters received a great deal of support. During the war, the BBC's chief broadcaster, the Rt Hon. Sir Arthur Said, was recognised as a hero and a great innovator in the field of broadcasting. He was also described by the Foreign Office as a'man of genius'. During this time, British broadcasters also began to gain greater support from overseas in terms of listening and watching their programmes, the BBC also made a concerted effort to encourage foreign viewers to see its programmes. When broadcasting first commenced in England it was the only way to hear radio programs - even if only occasionally. However, the technology became far more widely available after the war, making it possible to watch radio plays, news reports, and advertisements on TV screens. The new technology of radio, together with its many other uses, helped the BBC to become the most significant broadcaster in the world. The BBC became a multi-media corporation in 1966, a very important development for the development of broadcasting technology, but a new challenge for broadcasting organisations. In the first few years of the 1970s, the BBC dominated its domestic market. It broadcast BBC programmes on a wide variety of channels, including local radio stations and the BBC's TV channels - which were telecast throughout the world. As the British population began to realise the potential of radio, the BBC expanded its reach by moving to multiple local transmitters. The BBC also provided radio services to other nations, such as Sweden and the US. It also made a number of overseas broadcasting agreements with other countries, including with France and Germany, and with Britain and the Soviet Union. But in the early part of the 1970s, the BBC gradually expanded its international scope, and it became more aggressive in its foreign markets. In the 1960s, it became increasingly difficult for broadcasting organisations to maintain a global presence. As a result, it was often forced to change its broadcasting policies in order to meet this target audience. As the 1970s approached, broadcasters began to take note of its potential in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. The BBC made a decision at the beginning of the decade to begin producing a number of programmes to appeal to a wider audience. Its broadcasts from the UK, the USA, Australia and various African countries were all aimed at a wide, and sometimes very local, market. The BBC also aimed to boost its overseas markets, by inviting telecommunications companies to enter Africa. In addition, British radio broadcasting expanded further, introducing such services","Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology ""Broadcasting"" originally meant sowing seeds broadly by hand.

C2,"In his first book, Reading is an Exercise, Frank Kermode set out the practical and philosophical underpinnings of literary criticism: the value of reading as an experience, the value of giving something something to take with you. In the context of his work, reviews are, or can be, an indispensable source of information for readers. By concentrating on the craft of review-writing, he argues that these can be an essential contribution to literary criticism. Frank Kermode is the founding editor of The New Statesman. He has written for many publications, including The Booker Prize-winning book journal The New York Times, and the literary review website Bookforum.org. He has recently published two books: What’s a Review for? and How to Write a Good One. He was elected for a CBE in 1993.","The book review is one of the most effective ways to communicate with others. It is used to help convince people to buy books they may otherwise not have bought. It’s also a powerful tool for marketing goods and services. However, critics are faced with many challenges as they try to write a good book review. In this article, I will look at several review-writing techniques that will help you get noticed and to get a few readers. 1. First, learn what makes a good review: is it a positive one, or a negative one?: It helps to have a specific audience you can talk to in order to write a good review, so it’s a good idea to know what is common among these different groups. You can use this list of criteria to write a good review: is the book well written, interesting, and engaging?: Readers look for books that are engaging and engaging. If the reader can’t get engaged on the first read, it’s likely that they are unlikely to keep reading. If the reader can’t get engaged on the second or third read, it’s likely that they haven’t experienced much of the book at all. This is an incredibly important criteria for the reviewer to include in the review: Is the book relevant to the subject of the review?: This is especially important if you are writing about entertainment, but if you are writing about a book about science, it’s even more important. The readers will come back to the book later in order to get some useful details, or to find out more about the material. The reader should always make sure that the book is entertaining and interesting. If it’s not, it will not be recommended to them and won’t be recommended in the future. If the book is boring, it will not be recommended in the future. If it is boring, it will not be recommended in the future. In short, the audience will not know how the book is written, and will not care. This is a very important aspect of a review, because the readers will remember it. 2. One should be careful of being too critical.: People can be very harsh critics. If your review is not fair, then your readers won’t be reading it. It is more important to read the book and understand its message, than to be critical about it. The same goes for the review if you write a review that is inflammatory or critical. The reviews should be positive, but not critical. If someone gets upset by your review, then you should point this out to the editor. If you write a negative review, then you should try to come up with a positive conclusion, and not just say the book was boring. 3. Some critics write short reviews quickly, because they don’t have much time to sit down and write a long review.: The key to a good review is to be able to write quickly, but with an in-depth understanding of the subject. Some people find that they can write more quickly than others, because they see things differently. For example, while one person will say “this book is amazing”, another person might say that it has some problems. This makes people feel that they don’t understand the book, which leads them to criticise it. The reviews should be readable, easy to read and accessible. If you are writing a review for a paper and you don’t know the content well, this isn’t good. You need to know all the details. 4. Short reviews aren’t necessary; they just shouldn’t be long.: A short review can be more useful to readers than long ones. Short reviews aren’t always helpful, because they contain a lot of detail that will make you think a lot. The author needs to read the book before writing the review, so that the reader can see what the author is saying. Also, people can rely on the reviews to give them information about a book that they are reading. If the book has a good plot and a strong beginning and middle, and the end and middle, it is possible to write a review that can be read by the audience. If it is not a story, then the review should be focused on a certain element. 5. A review can only be written by someone who likes to write.: Only someone who has read the book. It must also be a review written by a person who has not read the book. That person must not only like the book, but must also like the author. This means that a review must",Frank Kermode is a reviewer and a former chairman of the London College of Communication.,"This review was written by a Grade 2 learner who wishes to write a book review. Frank Kermode was a practitioner, a review writer. He had written over 1,000 reviews. Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life.","As a reviewer, what is the most valuable tool in my box? The reader’s interest is paramount, and in the eyes of potential readers, quality counts. However, the first impression a review creates can be extremely superficial. So far, I have emphasized my personal opinions when writing reviews. Here is why: “Too often the book reviewer is not really a reader at all – not a person, not even a journalist or scholar. If I have a personal opinion, it is simply because I feel passionately about the work. Writing a review is a form of communication, and is the first time in a student’s life when he or she decides to seek, and then accepts, publication. There are many things that can go wrong, and a reviewer must be able to detect, and respond to, all these potential problems. For a review to be effective, it must be both clear and comprehensive. And what are the pros and cons of a review being either too subjective or too objective? In my own experience, both have their own pros and cons, and it can be hard for the reviewer to know which approach to take. For example, if I am looking for something that has not been read by others yet, I might use some of the information contained in an earlier review (although I don’t have to) in order to help others decide whether they should read it, or not. The first major part of the review is the introduction, which sets out the aims of the book, the structure of the work, and how it fits into the context. My initial aim was to give a quick overview of the book as a whole. However, I quickly realised that the introduction was not entirely effective, and I could have written a more detailed review of the work – for instance, providing an analysis of the arguments used and the impact on certain sections of the text. In my next post I’ll go into more depth on some aspects of this more complex review, which will require a little research on my part.

Your advice seems to always be accurate.","The reviewers’ world revolves around the idea that the reader must make a decision quickly based on a review. The idea that a review has to be written in a particular style and with a certain number of words to make its point is very different from the idea that the review should be free-flowing and open-ended. The review should be clear and succinct, and readers should not have to think that a review can be a discussion of the book or a discussion of the book itself. In a similar fashion, the reviewer’s world revolves around the idea that the review should be written in a certain style and with a certain number of words to make its point.","A review, like most things, comes and goes. Whether it is a blog, a magazine article or a newspaper article, one needs to give it time and space to develop and grow. To become a good reviewer you have to make your work both engaging and informative. The first thing to do is to read the book so you can know the kind of questions you are likely to have after reading it. Then you need to be able to express your opinion clearly and concisely. When reading a review, be sure to look for a certain type of content. If the publisher wants a review to come with a starred review, then the book has been read widely and received a good rating. If a book is a hardback, then it needs a clear cover, because a hardback can hide the content. Secondly, you can also use the words of others. You can use quotations to express your opinion. This could be a line of dialogue in a book, or a question on your own website. Finally, you should avoid being subjective. If you are looking for an opinion piece then try to be objective. This will make your work more interesting to readers. It will also make it easier for you to write in the future."
C2,"It has always been controversial. I was not one for watching the news. I had an impression that the news was about to become a little crazy when Donald Trump blasted the media for not taking a side, and he blasted the press for not being tough. It got me thinking about the idea that we are all pretty much destined to be a little crazy one day. I thought about the idea that if we weren’t a little crazy then everything might have fallen apart. I decided that I needed to see the film again to reassess it. Then I read the book Citizen Kane. I don’t remember much, I was a child but when I turned eighteen I took a vacation from the classroom. I sat down at my computer and wrote a piece that would illustrate the premise of the book, and I wanted to try to convince my readers that they shouldn’t fear the future because there’s a good chance of it. It took several days, it was one big blockbuster, but it was well worth the wait. I thought back to the time when my mother first asked me to write this piece and asked me if I had anything like that in my childhood. That was in the 1950s. It had been a long time since my mom had read books. She wanted me to write a story about a little girl named Ella. I would be very much in love with her and I’d go through all this time wondering, how could my mother have come to think that I’d be in love with something like Ella? I knew the answer would be, “Well – I read it to my mom.” My mom loved this story. I went to see it in theaters and I remember thinking that I could write a story about a girl with a blue hair, blue eyes, and hair trimmed in a ponytail. I also thought that I had the right idea because when I saw it in the theater I couldn’t believe how big that thing was. I took Ella to the park to be photographed and I wanted to get that shot of her with a big brown eye, and my mom thought that was impossible because it was such a gruesome story. I was right. Ella’s eyes were pierced by two black eyelashes from a fight, but my mom was not impressed. The movie was not a big box office hit and it wasn’t widely distributed like other movies. People started to pay attention to Kane on television in the late 90s and early 2000s when it started airing on NBC. The next morning the film was aired again and the story was revealed. I started to wonder, was the film still great? I began to see some of the other movies that I had never seen before. I began to realize that this was something special that I never had, despite the fact that I had not seen it before. Now I understand that it’s a movie that everyone should see at least once. Hopefully you have seen the movie if not, or maybe, you haven’t seen it yet. Tell me about it in the comments below. Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed it.","Citizen Kane (1939) is a classic, one of the greatest films ever made. It was a huge commercial failure upon its release, but was considered a classic film by its critics. It was shown on television in 1977, and rediscovered in 2011. The film was not a commercial success, but its impact had an enormous impact on the lives of Americans.","Citizen Kane had not done so well upon its release in 1941 and despite reviews that were largely ecstatic, it was not a commercial success. But when television came along in 1952, the movie was brought back to the public consciousness, and it has since become a cultural touchstone. At the time of writing, there are 93 million televisions in the UK. It’s been seen more times than a moon landing. Aside from film, television can be said to be the biggest cultural force. It also plays a crucial role in the development of the film industry. Before the 1940s, Hollywood had a monopoly over television, where movies were filmed and distributed, so films had to be in theatres to sell tickets. But with the advent of television, Hollywood had to produce films on demand. That meant film studios could quickly and easily make films that did not fit into the conventional format of a feature film. So, it wasn’t just Hollywood that was producing films on demand – television had the same effect as the print media when it came to film. Filmmakers, as we know from the history of movies, had to produce some sort of film, whether it was a short film, a musical, or a feature film. Then they had to find a suitable location. The location for Citizen Kane was New York’s Coney Island. It was also set next to a large aquarium. As a matter of fact, it is a natural. This is because the Coney Island Aquarium was a great attraction for tourists. When the movie became a TV hit in 1952, the original Coney Island location would not be used for the film; it was set in the Coney Island Visitors Center, across from the Coney Island Aquarium. The attraction is still there today. Even though Coney Island was not really a tourist destination, the site was used to set the movie in 1941. When the film finally appeared in 1941 – despite the brouhaha that attended its release – despite the largely ecstatic reviews, and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success. This was not a surprise; the movie had a reputation as a controversial political piece. Nonetheless, it had a lasting impact on American popular culture. Over the years, the film has come to define the 1950s. Even though it was initially set during World War II, the scene of the atomic bomb exploding in Hiroshima has been seen in countless ads. But while the film’s significance is still with us, it’s been widely remade to reflect new audiences. What makes the film even more significant today is that it was the first feature film to use a 3D model in the scenes. Although it took some 20 years, the 3D reconstruction of Citizen Kane and other famous movies, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, was finally completed in 2001.","Citizen Kane, produced by silent film pioneer Alfred Hitchcock and shot by famed director David O. Selznick, is one of the most beloved of all films, even if it was never made a commercial success. When it finally appeared in 1941 despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst’s alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success. But on television it was brought back to the public consciousness. The film stars Hitchcock as the legendary journalist, and it reveals a side of Hitchcock that the general public has never known about. The film starts with Hitchcock traveling to Chicago to photograph a group of writers meeting at the home of Harry Morgan, a man who has hired Hitchcock to write about him. Hitchcock begins to write about Hitchcock and his friends for the Hitchcock Bulletin, a newspaper that he has established as the newspaper of record. Hitchcock’s wife, Dorothy Hitchcock, is surprised to see Hitchcock’s writing on the newspaper. She asks Hitchcock if he knew about the paper’s new editor, Dorothy Lane. Hitchcock takes Hitchcock to New York where they meet Hitchcock’s manager, Arthur Miller, who is not at all pleased with Hitchcock’s writing on Hitchcock. Hitchcock explains how Hitchcock went about writing the movie’s script. Hitchcock used Hitchcock’s original screenplay, as well as an adaptation by the author James Mason, as a guide when he was working on Citizen Kane. During the film’s development Hitchcock, while making notes, wrote notes during the shooting of the film. These notes showed Hitchcock’s vision of his characters and influenced his work. However, Hitchcock had very little involvement in developing the script or in the film’s directorship. That is until he saw the film screened on television. The re-airings brought out all the subtle nuances Hitchcock had missed the first time around. The film became one of the most beloved films of all time, appearing on every major network’s schedules. However, it was only in 1959 that Hitchcock showed the film on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Amid the excitement of seeing this classic film the show’s producers decided to make a new documentary to help explain what Hitchcock did to make such a great film. Citizen Kane, directed by Hitchcock and starring Hitchcock, tells the story of Hitchcock, a young reporter who takes a job as an editor for a newspaper in Chicago. After suffering a lobotomy in the early 1930’s, Hitchcock has become one of the most famous film directors in Hollywood. He has directed the best films of his career, and has been a mainstay on the stage. But his work has often seemed to fade into the past, with critics and viewers alike expressing disdain for Hitchcock’s direction.","Citizen Kane was released in 1941, the same year in which William Randolph Hearst was acquitted of his charges of being a publisher of The Sun newspaper. This is because it was a ‘parody’ of Hearst and of his role in The Sun’s scandalous start with its publication of an article comparing the newspaper and magazine to Nazi Germany, as a means to thwart Hitler’s plans to launch an invasion of Poland in September 1939. Despite its highly acclaimed reviews, Citizen Kane was not a commercial success. Initially, it was delayed on account of its distributor, MGM,’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst might do to them. Instead, it was released in November 1941. However, because of the controversy surrounding its release and the high price of filming it, the film could not be released until early 1943. The reason for the delay was because MGM’s management insisted that the film should not be commercialized. Hearst's publisher, Frederic Wertham, wanted the film to be a “political” film, meaning that it should portray either the Republican president or the Republican National Committee. Citizen Kane, despite this, was also acclaimed as a political drama starring Laurence Olivier as the Republican president. For most of its running time, he is the only character in the film that does not have a single political motivation. He is driven to win a re-election campaign for the United States Senate by the charismatic and handsome Kane (William Hutton), whose name appears on a bumper sticker in the film. Willie's character is also controversial because he is seen as a man who has some sexual relations with a woman, played by Elizabeth Taylor (Hutton played by Grace Kelly). The film shows how the relationship between the president and his right-hand man develops and how, through the character of the Republican National Committee, Kane is made to feel like a second-class citizen. By the end, the film shows how powerful an influence his ego has over him. It also shows that the ego is not everything.",Citizen Kane was a film that had made a lot of people think about the media and how it affected them.,"When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941, despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of the distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst’s alleged subject might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. The movie, based on a novel by Victor Hugo, told the tale of the eccentric businessman who started his newspaper empire in San Francisco at the turn of the 20th century. He set up the newspaper, which soon became a sensation, and he hired a young reporter, William Dalton, to interview Kane. Kane became an internationally famous celebrity, and later went on to play a part in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."

In fact, the last of Britain’s feudal families was the Glyns, who were a powerful family in the north and south of England. Known for their fine food, luxury items, and high standards of personal and public service, the family was heavily involved in political life and was heavily involved in English culture. Their daughter Elizabeth was also the last female Glyn and also referred to as Glynns, meaning the Glynns in English. The inscriptions found in the Glyns’ home on Southwark Hill commemorate the first recorded breakfast, and the last time a Glynn was buried in London. According to researchers at the University of Kent, the first mention of a breakfast was in the 14th century and it was the first documented reference to a breakfast since 1713. But what exactly was the first breakfast in England? Well, the Oxford English Dictionary claims that this was a dish of “salted, cooked, boiled, fried or roasted” and “lamb”. It was made by “a poor person, a servant, or an assorted free people” and is dated to 1500 A.D. It’s thought to be made by a sleaze merchant (or possibly a priest). The historian Janet Taylor wrote a book on the history of food in early England. The book, The Breakfast Revolution, is the result of 18 years research, and it is based on the interviews she conducted with Englishmen who ate breakfast in order to survive to 300. The women rated their own breakfasts in terms of taste, texture, flavour and overall quality. Taylor compared the “dainties” she’d eaten at various times in her life, and compared them to the breakfasts they now ate. She found that the three meals she ate at least once a day were boiled eggs with sausages and meat and fried potatoes, fishcakes, oatcakes and mashed banana, all of which she found to be healthy. The earliest recorded breakfast mention was in the 14th century and it’s believed it was made in Yorkshire by a man named William Mortimer. Despite their different breakfasts, the two men were apparently friends. Mortimer was a soldier who spent the night in the Tower of London before being sent on a hunting mission to the West Indies and died just days after returning home with his family. Mortimer’s obituary has been found in the Tower’s cellar, with Mortimer’s mother, Elizabeth, who she referred to as Elizabeth Mortimer, having died when she was 12. Mortimer’s mother Elizabeth Mortimer, also known as Esther Mortimer, is believed to have been a friend to the Bede family and a frequent visitor to the Tower. Her daughter Elizabeth, also known as Elizabeth, was once the oldest living person in England at the age of eighty. One of the many interesting details of his obituary is that Elizabeth had suffered from a nervous breakdown and had to return to London to care for her. Elizabeth, who was aged seven, said he was very ill and went to bed, but her mother’s memory was that he ate dinner at his uncle’s house in Yorkshire. On the eve of the King’s death at Oxford in 1547, Elizabeth’s brother-in-law Thomas had invited Elizabeth and her sister-in-law Anne to visit his uncle’s house and they stayed for a few days. In England, breakfast was served to the nobility at a relatively early stage. In ancient Rome and Rome, a glass of wine with the main meal was an important ritual for women. In India, the adage “no water before tea” would be a universal message to women. For some women, who had no access to electricity, eating an early morning meal wasn’t a luxury but a necessity to survive the day. In the Middle Ages breakfast meant getting up and eating something before going to bed, mainly to prevent starvation. There are still a lot of misconceptions about breakfast that could be traced back to the medieval era. Some think it is an omen of the coming of the Tudors and the early English monks, and some people mistakenly think that breakfast was all about eating. Breakfast isn’t just an","Breakfast, according to the government, had only been introduced to England by 1670.","The English breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. It is a simple meal – porridge, muesli, toast, fruit, tea – and served in the morning. If you are a foodie, you might consider having a porridge or breakfast sausage with a sausage and bacon casserole. For those looking for something more filling, some breakfast cereals are now available, like muesli bars and wholemeal toast. It is easy to overindulge during the summer months. That’s when breakfast becomes especially important. A good example of this is a cereal drink called the ‘Potosi’ drink. This is a boiled juice drink made from peaches that are rolled into a ball and smothered in jam. For those who prefer their food slightly sweeter, a mixture of honey and maple syrup is available. This was the most common breakfast drink on the Continent until World War II. Breakfasts for kids have also become popular. Children today, like most people throughout the world, eat two or three portions of food every day. Breakfast was an easy source of calorie for a child growing up during the second world war. It has been shown to reduce risk of some cancers and heart disease, as well as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and heart failure. The fact that breakfast never appears in the medieval era means that it was only a relatively late arrival in England. In fact, breakfast has been served at breakfast for most of human history. This includes the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. The breakfast eaten by the Egyptians was boiled water with wheat, honey, meat and spices. The Egyptians also used to eat meat with vegetables, such as squash, onions and grapes. The Greeks were also fond of fruits as snacks, such as oranges. These fruits are often boiled before being served and eaten with bread, tea, oil and wine. For breakfast in Egypt, the main meal was a huge breakfast. It was usually made up of meat, wine, vegetables, salad, rice, a few small fruits, bread and olives. Breakfasts were a major part of the breakfast table at the time. The Romans enjoyed a breakfast of pancakes and egg. Breakfast in Rome was a mixture of fish, bread, potatoes, rice, tomatoes, yoghurt, wine, oil and spices. The Greeks also enjoyed fruits, such as apples, grapes, plums, pears, cherries and a few peaches. The diet was wholesome and healthy but the food was often expensive. The meals were also served with a large glass of wine and a few aperitifs. The Greeks were known for eating small portions of food throughout the day, compared to the large amounts of food they consumed at night. A well-made breakfast could feed an entire country. And then there was the French, who have taken breakfast to new heights. They had the largest breakfast buffet in Europe. The French breakfast, known as the ""French Breakfast"", consisted of several types of foods, including vegetables and fruits, as well as fruit and coffee. Today, this breakfast has become one of the most popular foods in the world. The french breakfast is eaten by nearly everyone around the world. Most people eat it at least once a week. Here’s what French breakfasts look like... The most commonly known French breakfast is the omelette. French breakfast is eaten with white cheese, tomatoes, a hard-boiled egg, milk and peppers. The omelette was made with white cheese, onions and bell peppers, and mayonnaise. The bacon is made with sausage, bacon, cheese and tomato. The bacon is grilled, sliced, fried and served with mayonnaise. Depending on the country, it is available as either a sandwich, crepe or a benedict. This French breakfast is made with tomatoes and cheese. You can get omelettes (like a sandwich or crepe) with scrambled eggs, black beans and mushrooms or served with ham, sausage and bacon. In France, omelettes are considered to be a meal in their own right, which means they are less expensive than a breakfast cereal. In Britain they are common, usually in a restaurant or in a cafe. In France the most common type of breakfast is called a croissant or brioche. The croissant is one of the most popular French breakfasts, served with bread, milk, cheese and fried onions. In the US, pancakes are made with eggs, bacon, cheese, cheese and","A man who had been working a bleak job in a London pub and had a heart attack when he saw a television commercial for a shambles at his local post office. At first, he thought nothing of taking a bite out of the bag and returning it but later, as he sipped his morning coffee, he remembered the image of a man dressed in his nightie and cap, hunched over his table, eating a cup of porridge laced with rum. “Hmmm, what a strange idea,” he admitted, adding he felt very bad about the shambles as he listened to the TV advert. “A good healthy breakfast is not only nutritious, it is also important in our survival and that is why the NHS wants to educate the public that a good breakfast is not only nutritious, it is important in our survival and that is why the NHS wants to educate the public that a good breakfast is not only nutritious, it is important in our survival and that is why the BBC is bringing a breakfast TV programme to our screens,” he said.","Breakfast’s recent introduction to English culture is as varied and as varied as our dietary needs. One thing has remained constant – the way people eat it is changing. From the earliest times, breakfast has been eaten in the mornings in much the same way as coffee is today. In ancient times people would eat a full meal, typically consisting of a large meal or three meals and a dessert. However the British diet was very different and there were many ways to eat – the typical British breakfast consisted of a mug of tea, a slice of toast or a full English breakfast sandwich. Today there are so many different breakfast options that one hardly has to look too far back to find a classic English meal. Many English people are familiar with the British omelette, and the English boiled egg and bacon. These are just two of the many breakfast foods that are now popular in the UK. People are also eating pancakes for breakfast, which is a popular breakfast food in many areas in the world. A bowl of porridge is a popular breakfast food in America.","England has never stopped arguing about whether breakfast should be compulsory or not. Even though some breakfast eaters are complaining, there has been no revolution in the way the British have eaten their breakfasts. Although breakfast was a staple in the Middle Ages, it was often served just after the meal which was often an empty bowl before the actual meal, which would leave the waiters hungry for the second meal. The most popular breakfast of the 18th century was the sausage and egg toast, although there were different types of toast and the English never ate pancakes.","A breakfast revolution is brewing in England. The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts, but in historical terms, breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. A new survey by The Daily Telegraph and the British Academy found that 31% of Brits eat breakfast at least once a week. Breakfast is not a new concept, but it has only become more popular over the last couple of decades, with 33% of Brits now buying breakfast cereal on a daily basis. However, there is also a belief that breakfast’s popularity will not last for long, with a third of Brits now stating that they never eat breakfast at all. A recent study by the British Academy and the University of Leicester found that one in five women will skip breakfast."
