" Other people work on the plans, doing different jobs like laying bricks, painting the outside, and installing the electricity and plumbing. Then someone lets the people decide if they like the building. If they don't like it they can change it. If they like it, it's built. People even come up with new ideas for buildings as new jobs are needed.


Buildings are used to: Keep us dry and warm  
Used to watch football matches  
Used to keep beautiful things in  
People come up with new ideas


People have always used buildings to make things like: Buildings can be used to keep us dry and warm, to watch football matches and pop concerts. We can also use buildings to keep beautiful things like museum safe. People can even come up with new ideas and do new jobs for buildings.


People who like a building can say ""this building is cool"" and can change the building. People who don't like a building can change it and do not like the building anymore. If many people don't like a building, it's changed. People who like it can say ""this building is awesome"". This is how we build a story with the prompt from the beginning.


People work on buildings in the same way they do on other buildings like museums. An architect lays out the plan of a building, someone does the different jobs like laying bricks, painting the outside, and installing the electricity and plumbing.


The architect can come"," Engineers then measure the strength of the materials and decide how much each should cost. There are people with special skills to do jobs like cutting the material into shapes, painting the outside, hanging the windows, or putting seats in the stadium. Finally, we make the buildings that we use every day. A house, a bus, a city wall. Each is built by people, and it is people's stories we should celebrate. 

Write a paragraph using the following structure:

Buildings are everywhere in our everyday lives. We use them for sport, for shelter, for art. People make them together and each person contributes to this unique and wonderful story. People use architecture, engineering and arts to build, for example, a bus or a city wall. Architects draw plans for buildings and engineers decide how strong they should be. There is an engineer who works with wood that is very strong but also biodegradable. Artists paint the outside of buildings, decorate them and tell stories. We could all build with buildings too. Each one has a different shape. Some houses have 2 floors and some just 1. It is people like architects, engineers and artists that build the buildings that we use every day.

Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings like museums to keep beautiful things in. Many people work"," The builders and masons put the bricks together to make the walls, and the electricians and plumbers do the wiring and the plumbing, so the building can be used. 

We use brick, stone and wood. Brick and stone are both made from rocks that are found in the ground and are therefore the building materials that people have been using for thousands of years. Brick is the oldest and most common building material. Stone is also a hard material, although a bit softer than brick. Wood is not a building material, because people do not like the idea of using wood for buildings. Wood burns and people who like to smoke sometimes burn their houses down.

Many different kinds of people live in the world. There are people in England, Italy and France and each of them like to use different kinds of bricks. People in England like brick with thin edges and people in France like the thick edges. Each country has masons and plumbers who are specialised in different jobs. Everywhere there are engineers to measure the height of the wall and electricians to make the building energy-efficient.

The design of a building depends on what the purpose of the building is. When a building is used for housing, the design has to be comfortable for the people who live in it. Some people like to live in tall buildings, so the design has to take height into account. When a building is used for offices, the design has to be very strong to be"
" Paul handed him a box of chocolates. 'This is for your best man speech.' Harry smiled as he opened the box, as he chewed he wondered where he would meet this couple. He knew it would be somewhere special. The thought of marrying Paul was enough to make any girl blush. 'Now, what about that volcano?' Paul asked. Harry looked at Paul and saw his love for the volcano. It was ingrained in his eyes. 'As much as I love your smile, I'm afraid I will miss the train.' 

Harry was so excited and knew that he would remember this moment for a long time. He watched the clock until 6:00 pm, and then jumped out of bed. His heart was pounding as he made his way to the bathroom, where he grabbed his box of chocolates and a present for Paul. He sat down on the bed and looked in the box and thought of Paul smiling ear to ear. When he got Paul's gift in his hand, he saw that Paul had gotten him a beautiful ring and a bottle of champagne. He knew Paul would love the ring, and it would match his eyes. He looked at the box and saw the card, and the heart with the word 'You' written in it. 'What is this?' he asked. He opened the card and read 'From Paul to Harry'. He couldn't stop smiling as he opened the champagne and saw the bottle was half empty.

Harry"," 'I will understand but please don't force me.' Harry and Paul went to speak to Lily and Hermione who were looking a little unhappy. 

Harry looked at the map with Paul and they both agreed that they would probably still make it to Dante's Peak. They stopped at a coffee shop and got themselves a latte and a pastry. Harry knew that after this part of the adventure the hardest would be over, but he also knew that it would be the most rewarding. 

While they were waiting for the latte to brew Paul asked Harry what he was going to do when he got to Dante's Peak. 

'I'm going to work as a tour guide, telling people about the beautiful sights and giving them advice on how to prevent and cure diseases.' Harry replied. 

'Sounds like a fantastic job.' Paul nodded. 'Have you ever thought of working in a hospital?' 

'No, I've never wanted to.' Harry answered. 

The latte arrived and they both took a sip. 'That's a very wise answer,' Paul said. 'Safety is an important issue. I was thinking that you should work with animals.' 

Harry looked at Paul. 'Animals?' he asked, a little confused. 'Like dogs, cats, and other animals that people own?' 

'Yes. Would you like to work at a veterinary clinic?' 

'That would be amazing.' Harry replied. 'I'm absolutely","  
'Dante's Peak has a special place in my heart.' Said Paul.  
'I know. We love it here and we will be happy here.' Said Harry. Harry looked at his watch and realised that the reception was about to start. He gave Paul a hug and got ready for his speech.

  * Harry is Paul's best man and lives in Dante's Peak. Paul reminds Harry of his dream job of a volcano eruption forecaster. Harry loves the town and agrees to go with Paul to be his witness.  
Harry is nervous, but loves the town too. He thinks of the money they can make and the potential customers. 
  * The speech is Paul's dream job but Harry doesn't fully understand the risks involved. He is looking forward to it and leaves the speech planning to ask more questions during dinner. 
  * Harry looks out for the new bride, and notices a family getting ready for the reception. He sees the mother is struggling with her dress and he offers to help her. He tries on the dress, and makes small adjustments. The dress looks nice on her. He then notices a small girl at the side of the stage. Her eyes meet his and he feels his stomach flutter. He can't take his eyes off her. He follows the procession of the new bride into the reception area and watches as she sees her dad and family. The father hugs the little girl and whispers something in her ear. 
  "," 'But I don't like the look of those mountains and the town has always been struggling.'

Harry thought for a moment. 'OK. I will go then.' Harry's uncle took his hand. 'Thanks Uncle Paul. You are a good friend.' Paul and Harry walked outside. The two men hugged. Paul patted Harry's back and said 'it's ok to be afraid. When you are afraid, you become strong. Come back soon.' Harry turned around to see his uncle looking back at him with tears in his eyes. Harry nodded and turned away. His uncle followed him and hugged him again.

Harry smiled and nodded at Dante's Peak. He was the best man. He turned towards the door and stepped outside. He looked up at the mountains and took a deep breath. Then he walked down the street. Dante's Peak looked very beautiful. Harry walked closer to the mountains. He heard laughter behind him and turned around. A few villagers had started to follow him. They were all smiling. One of the villagers said 'we are happy that you are the best man. We will have a good party. You will like it here.' Harry smiled. He turned around and continued to walk down the street.

Harry was so close to the mountains now. He was standing in front of a door. Harry opened the door and went inside. He was now at the reception. There were a lot of guests in the room. Some of them were his"," 'I get it. We go, we party and then we leave tomorrow morning. It's a small town, they'll miss us.'  

Write the story in present tense.

Harry was the best man at Paul's wedding but Paul insisted that Harry should go to the party because it was 'Dante's Peak' and people here were worried about volcanoes and money. 

As they were walking down the street Harry couldn't believe it. It really was Dante's Peak. Every other shop was closed. Even the post office was closed because it was 'the end of the world today'! Harry and Paul walked down the street and saw all the empty shops. It was as if everyone had gone to the party but they hadn't. 

They entered the hall and there was a stage in the middle. There was a band, and a minister speaking. Harry didn't recognise the minister but the band were really good, they were really good. 

Harry looked at Paul. Paul looked around and whispered, 'are we going to be here all night?' Harry laughed and said, 'of course not, I'll drive you home.' 'Good,' said Paul. 'Let's dance.' They danced until it was midnight and then Paul said, 'now we should head home.' 

'Where's home?' Harry said as they arrived outside Paul's house.

'I live in Florence. It's in Tuscany in Italy,' Paul"," 'But you must understand also that I do love the volcanoes.' 'I know that,' Paul said. 'But it is not always the best thing for business.' Harry smiled at the punch line of the joke. Paul continued 'and so there may be issues with volcanoes.' Harry laughed and then started to tell a story about some friends of his who own a volcano museum. 'And they go everywhere showing people how to make volcano mudpies and how to spot a volcanic eruption when you are miles away and you have no way to get out of the way. And its true they are a beautiful desert around the volcano and the colours are amazing and you can smell the ash and you hear the rumblings.' Harry then showed Paul one of the mudpies. 'They are also very good for you,' Harry said. 'But I think they are better for the planet and you should go to the museum.' 'Thats good advice Harry,' Paul said but I think they should move to a less populated area and think about growing their business in one of the cities where people will visit and spend money.' 'Thats a good point Paul.' They both sat back and thought about the suggestion. Paul agreed that perhaps moving to a less populated area and expanding their market base to a city was a good idea. 'We will think about it.' Paul said and then stood up and hugged Harry. Harry stood up and shook Pauls hand. 'Thanks Paul,' Harry said as they"," 'You are the best man. But I also like to take the party to my home town.' 

'I love this country' said Paul. 'But it's not the same when you have tourists there. You must understand that. No one wants to pay a lot of money to see a volcano. For real volcanoes, there are places for these tourists in the world. Places with beautiful nature, great cuisine and history.' 'But I do have a home town, where I have a business too and the people are very friendly' said Harry. 'Besides, I have my volcano, called Stromboli.' 

'That's not a volcano. That's a small island' said Paul. 'I don't see why tourists would go to visit that. You have my vote. We will go. But you have to promise me to make them visit the island as well.' 

'Yes' said Harry. 'I promise.'

 'I will go with the best man to my home town' Harry said. 'But you won't convince me to visit Stromboli.' 'But Harry', Paul started. 'Please, just this once. Maybe you will change your mind.' Harry smiled. 'OK. I will visit my island. But only if the volcano gives us ash.'

" Only this year the Old Code was called into question. They fought in the streets, and if the king didn't defend himself no one would he king. Einon wasn't a peasant. But he was a knight who only fought in the old way. His grandfather fought in the old way, his father fought in the old way and he wanted to keep fighting in the old way. He wasn't cruel, he just had to defend himself. 'Bowen! Don't talk to him like that! He's only a boy.'sighed the knight. He really didn't like Einon much. He had only just arrived in the Kingdom and the king already treated him as if he was beneath contempt. The knights knights treated peasants as second class citizens. There had to be a way to teach both sides of the dispute about the Old Code.'sang the knight. He and Bowen had travelled together all over the kingdom. They had fought on the borders of the kingdom. And they had spoken to people in the kingdom. And people loved the idea of fighting their battles with their hearts. So they brought the boy into the hall and called for ale. When the boy entered the hall everybody stopped what they were doing and looked at him. Bowen loved the boy. Bowen had met many peasants and knew their lives. But he also had a sense for the knight. Sir Bowen loved people and was kind to them. Einon wasn't a peasant but he was a"," Now it looks like Bowen is going against everything the king and the Old Code stood for. 'Listen to me. Your heart and head. They are not enemies. The heart wants what the head says to do. And if you listen to your heart, you will always do what is right. Just follow your head. And don't fight with your heart!', Bowen shouted at Einon as he left the city. And with that he turned his back on the king and his evil ways. And he became a good Knight of the Old Code. 
'Oh no you didn't! I won't fight with my heart, you may have convinced me but my heart still wants to fight with a peasant for land he doesn't own!', Einon said to himself as he continued to think about Bowen. 

In this story Bowen is a knight of the old Code. He believes in the Code and wants to uphold it. He believes in the goodness of kings and wants to uphold that. He is a good example of a knight of the old Code. Einon, on the other hand, is a rude peasant who is a bit too interested in the land he owns. He is fighting with his heart and not his head.

  * What is a knight of the old Code?
  * Knights of the old Code are brave warriors who uphold the old Code, which states that you should follow your head, and not your heart, if you want to"," The Old Code was the way. To prove you were a real knight you had to go against an animal, and you had to hit your target three times. 

Einon had a bad temper, but he was a good fighter. Sir Bowen knew that Einon would fight bravely for the Old Code. But Sir Bowen also knew that sometimes a knight needed to make a bad decision to protect his heart. So Sir Bowen gave Einon a challenge that would test both Einon's courage and his judgment. He made him fight a lion! 

The lion was huge! Bowen told Einon to 'fight with your head', but Einon was nervous. He didn't even know how to fight with his head. The knight looked at his friend. 'Your heart,' he said. 'Let it rule your head.' And Bowen was proud. He gave Einon the sign and waited for the signal to attack. 

Einon leaped at the lion and his sword flew through the air. The lion lunged at him. In the confusion Sir Bowen missed. The lion killed him. 

Einon's head was spinning. He'd killed a lion! The New Code said: 'Kill with your heart'. But the Old Code was more important. If you lived by the Old Code you would protect the peasants and the Kings hearts. 

So Einon went to fight the lions. He fought bravely, and his"," 

The knight then told Einon to think of the Good King Horst, he was kind to peasants and knighted them and made them knights as well. He then showed Einon a plaque of a knightly deed. A peasant was knighted and the knight gave the peasant a ring and a medallion. Einon should think of this every time he feels bad. 

Einon was confused and went to fight another day. 
The knight then had Bowen think of the times he treated peasants and knights well, he gave Bowen a ring and a medallion as well. Bowen thought of the many times he was kind to kings prive and peasants. And he remembered his father teaching him the Old Code. Sir Bowen then knighted Einon.

  
In this fable, knights are similar to kings. They are kind and treat their peasants well. King Einon however is similar to the peasant. He is also confused and does not fight, because he does not think about the Good Code.

There are several steps to the story:

King Einon is confused, and goes into battle with another warrior.
Bowen gives Einon a plaque"," 'But remember the oath you made when you took the black ring. You promised to help nobody, not even your own king. That oath will bring you pain one day. But remember, your heart will not lead you, your head will. And the heart likes nice tunes and pretty stories. So I want you to fight the best you can and remember the Old Code for when your heart overpowers your head.' 'But Sir Bowen, I thought you were an A2A learner! What's A2A mean?' 'A2A means Almost Every Age. Sir Bowen was about 50 years old when he was talking to Einon. But, in fact, he was much younger. Like many of the characters in the story, Sir Bowen was an A2 learner. 'So Einon, I'm going to give you a series of questions and after I'm finished you have to answer them. The first one is: what's your name? Einon! I'm glad to meet you sir! The second one is: what's your favorite color? Blue! And the third one is: what's the best color? Green! 'Good, Einon! Sir Bowen wants you to fight with your head and your heart. Now remember the oath you swore before you took the ring from the Dark One: no help to nobody! So first of all you help me put down this tree, and make sure all the people around us are safe. Remember"," The Old Code was justice and love. But Einon didn't want to learn the Old Code. He wanted to be a gladiator. Fighting to the death. Fighting with his head!

Using this prompt, write a story that is accessible for Grade 2 learners.

The knight wanted to make Einon a good fighter. But he also wanted to teach him the Old Code. Sir Bowen and all the kings princes and knights before him were Knights of the Old Code. For thousands of years kings were kind to peasants and knights helped kings. The Old Code was justice and love. But Einon didn't want to learn the Old Code. He wanted to be a gladiator. Fighting to the death. Fighting with his head!

Einon didn't want to learn the Old Code. Fighting to the death. Fighting with his head! He wanted to be a gladiator. Fighting to the death. Fighting with his head! 
Sir Bowen tried to make Einon a good fighter. But Einon was proud and wouldn't listen. Fighting to the death. Fighting with his head! Fighting to the death. Fighting with his head! 
Finally, Bowen told Einon that the Old Code wasn't nice and that it was time for him to learn the new Code. Sir Bowen tried to teach Einon the New Code. Fighting to the death. Fighting with his head! Fighting to the death. Fighting with his head! 
Now"," Bowen and all the kings knights had to follow the Code. And the Code said you should fight to defend your lands and your family! But when faced with an enemy you should also learn the Arts of War. To be a good fighter you needed to learn the Art of Deception. And you needed to know the Art of War as well. So Bowen led Einon through the steps of how to fight with a sword. Bowen showed him how to move his body in order to get a grip on his sword. Then he showed him how to parry, and how to block. But before he could attack, Bowen had to make his opening. So Bowen taught Einon how to attack without opening. And then he showed him how to stop his sword to prevent injury.
But the battle was not just with enemies. The peasants who lived nearby made the battle for Bowen's family life. And the peasants were always right. Sir Bowen always forgot to follow the Code. And the king's tax collectors could not understand the Old Code. So the knight had to learn the New Code.  

-The New Code was like the Old Code, but with modern weaponry. 
-The New Code helped to defend the land but also the family. 

Bowen led Einon through the steps of how to fight with a modern weapon. But Bowen was a knight of the Old Code, so he used the old fighting methods with sword and"

About 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers.


My grandfather farmed. He grew crops like wheat and potatoes. He also grew vegetables in the garden. He didn't know much about soil science but he had a feel for soil. He would plough and sow and sow and sow. It wasn't until a few years ago that I realised he had been farming for years before I was born. I remember as a child finding wheat seeds in the haystack and my grandfather telling me that wheat is a plant we can eat. My grandfather was an inspiration.

I remember as a child finding wheat seeds in the haystack and my grandfather telling me that wheat is a plant we can eat. My grandfather was an inspiration.


Like my grandfather, my father farmed. He grew carrots, parsnips, swedes and onions. We also had a small vegetable patch that grew tomatoes, peppers, cabbage and other green","

The first farmers grew plants to eat, but they also made things out of plants like clothes and tools. 
The first farmers lived in small groups in huts made of plants. The animals people had at the time were dogs, goats, chickens and cows.

The first farmers stayed with their animals in the same place for a long time because they used to hunt the animals they had. 

Around 10000 years ago people started to farm. They left their animal herds and began to plant seeds in the spring and grow crops all summer long. These crops became their food and the animals could be their food source.

In the beginning people farmed small plots of land. Over time they used strips of land larger than a plot. But in the beginning it was hard to get started.
Farming took a long time and was hard work. You could keep using the same land for farming for many years and sometimes even generations. This is why people needed to move every few years to find new places to grow crops.

  
  
The first farmers used plants as both their animals food and their clothing. They also made tools from plants. The first farmers lived in small groups of hunters and gatherers, and as they started to farm, they kept using the same land for a longer time. This is why people used to move to a new place every few years to let the land grow back after a crop was grown.

  
  
"," They started by clearing more land and by putting seeds in different locations so that they would grow. Gradually this led to more land being tilled and more people being able to live off of farming. 

It was the development of writing that allowed the passing on of knowledge from one generation to the other. This lead to more people being able to farm the land and so more people being able to live off of farming.  Writing allowed people to write down what they had done. They would then pass this down the generations. 

Writing has had a positive impact on how people live and have made it possible for them to have more of what they want and need.


The development of writing is a very important step in the history of farming and has a very positive impact on how people live.
Writing has allowed more people to be able to farm the land and live off farming.


This has led to more people having what they want and need and so the world has a lot more of what we want than before.  Writing has had a very positive impact on how people live.


It was the development of writing that allowed the passing on of knowledge from one generation to the other. This led to more people being able to farm the land and so more people being able to live off of farming.

It was about this time that the village life began to change, people started leaving their villages to go to other villages to trade. After about 7000 years of farming people still are not sure how to farm the land they have learned to live on.

General Structure:

Write a clear and compelling story about the first farmers and their discovery of farming. Describe how people learned to farm and how farming has continued over the years. Use descriptive text and make references to examples from history to support your story.

Farmers went to the forest to find fruit and plants to eat and 12000 years ago, the first farmers grew food and lived in villages. This is how people first farmed. 

People lived in villages until about 7000 years ago. Then farming started to change. Village life began to change when people started going to villages to trade. They no longer lived in their villages, they began to move about to find food. This is when the village life began to change, people started leaving their villages to go to other villages to trade.

Over the years people have not changed much how to farm the land they live on, they are not sure how to farm the land they have learned to live on.

History of Farming Before people started farming we went to the forest to look for plants or fruit we could eat. This meant people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12000 years ago in the Middle East people began to grow food. In the future people will go to the forest to look for food instead of going into the city. They will also spend less time looking after their animals because they will go out to hunt food for ourselves. In the future the people who live in cities will not own animals.

The first farmers, about 12000 years ago, were people living in the Middle East who started growing food.

  * The Flesch-Kinc"," 
There were two main methods of growing food. One way was to dig a deep pit and cover it with dirt so that the dirt would become food. Another way was to plant a seed inside a pot and water it so that the plant would grow. 
About 10,000 years ago people began to farm in bigger communities. There was a need for people in the towns to go to the farms so that they could have food too. So, people began to plant crops that would grow quickly so that they could sell the food and make money. They planted seeds of wheat, barley and lentils. 
Over the years different crops were grown in different parts of the world. People now eat lots of fruit and vegetables. Cereals are grown in many parts of the world. People now have access to more than just staple foods. For example people in Sub Saharan Africa have access to fresh vegetables.

" It is a very beautiful place to be if you like fishing. One weekend, when I was driving, I saw a man standing by the side of the road that I was passing. He was leaning on a long stick and was looking up into the sky. I slowed down so I could talk to him. When I got close I saw that he was looking through a spyglass at something that seemed to be very far away. I asked him what he was looking at. He said ""the stars"". I asked him what the stars were like up there. He said ""they were beautiful but I couldn't see them because the sun was in my eyes"". We talked about how strange it was to look up into the sky at a time when people used to do that because of the moon. ""It makes me feel very small and helpless,"" he said. We also talked about the people who build tiny houses on the ice so they can fish. ""They are so lucky,"" he said, ""I wish I were one of them."" I stopped the car and got out to shake his hand but he was already gone.

Based on this short paragraph, a person might assume that the man was elderly and that he was looking up at the stars because he was sad. However, the passage contains no information that would lead a person to make that inference. Nor does the man mention anything about his age or whether he was sad. The only thing we know about him is that he was driving","

"," Children often go with their parents to this lake. It is a fun day on a winter's day.  

ICE-FISHING is the second sentence in a short story written by Canadian author Margaret Atwood.  Ice-Fishing was published in the anthology ""The O.Henry Prize Stories 2016"".  In it Atwood uses some stereotypes of Canadian nature, but the story is well-written and contains some nice metaphors to Canadian geography.  One interesting aspect of the story is that Atwood uses a relative pronoun to introduce the second sentence, ""if you drive north from Toronto for three hours"".  This is unusual for Canadian English, and is interesting from a Canadian perspective.


The relative pronoun ""which"" is often used to introduce subordinate clauses or to replace a comma splattered between clauses in a long sentence.  In Ice-Fishing, ""which"" is used to introduce the second sentence: ""if you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing"".  This sentence is part of a short story, and is preceded by a prologue that describes who is reading the story and where it is being read, so the use of ""which"" is appropriate.


Another interesting aspect of this story is that it is set in Ontario but the characters are from Quebec.  Although Atwood often uses stereotypes of Canadian nature, the setting of her story in Ontario is balanced by the location of her characters in"," There is an artificial lake four hours south of Toronto but the cold winter weather doesn’t make it attractive for fishing. The fishermen in the North will argue that the lake is frozen because of climate, while those in the South will point out that there are no fish in the artificial lake. Which is right?


In the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scale, characters in newspapers and other printed materials read at a sixth-grade level, characters in books and magazines read at a fourth-grade level, and characters in other written material such as labels and signage read at a third-grade level.


Ice-Fishing

The fishermen in the North will argue that the lake is frozen because of climate, while those in the South will point out that there are no fish in the artificial lake. The fishermen in the North will argue that the lake is frozen because of climate, while those in the South will point out that there are no fish in the artificial lake.


Although both statements make logical sense, only the second one, that there are no fish in the artificial lake, is correct according to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale.


This is because the statement that there are no fish in the artificial lake is read at a third-grade level according to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale, which is below the fourth-grade level at which characters in books and magazines read.

Ice-fishing is a sport which is popular in many places in the northern hemisphere. Ice-fishing is a method of fishing which relies on using ice to fix the bait and to keep the fish in the water until they are caught. The fish can't break the ice and escape as they can in fresh water. Ice-fishing requires a certain skill to be able to be able to fish on ice.

  

  

Ice-fishing is a popular sport all over the world. However, it is particularly popular in Canada where it is known as 'Nipissing Outfit'. This sport is known for its beauty. Ice-fishers build little wooden homes on the ice, and in bright colours. They sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. In many places ice-fishing is considered to be a sport for all ages. Ice-fishing is also very healthy as it promotes weight loss due to low calorie food items.

  

  

In North America, ice-fishing is also known as 'lakeshore fishing'. In Europe, it is called 'fischeln'. In Brazil, it is called 'peixes de gelo'.

  

  

In North America, ice-fishing is a sport for all ages. However, it is particularly popular for people over 65 years of age. There are many ice-fishers in North America. People fish on","

The following is a quote from Mark Twain on reading: 

'Reading is easy. All one has to do is find something written in words that happened to have been written at an even pace at which I can read, and turn the pages until they are done. Then, if a passage happens to interest me, I stop reading and begin to read. Reading this passage, I found it rather hard to understand, and it seemed to me that the writer had made many unnecessary words and had spoken in very complicated and roundabout phrases. I was very unhappy with it, so I turned to the last page and was ready to go home when I arrived there. To my surprise, the words were still there, and I knew I could read them as easily as the first. This happened often, and one day I saw that the passage was divided into three pages, the third of which contained a very simple and to the point statement.'

This passage is a quote from a speech given by Mark Twain in Hartford in May 1874.

The 20th September should be avoided as this is a public holiday in Canada. This should be avoided as there are better public holidays in Australia in April. However, staff can take their holiday at any time between the 1st April and the 20th September.

Everyone agrees that Christmas should only be celebrated in December. The month of December is an appropriate time to save this joyous occasion for the coming year. Everyone is busy with preparing for the celebrations and will likely not have the time to take their holiday during December. I propose that New Years Day should become a public holiday, so that people can rest and relax. There should be a gift for everyone to celebrate, and it should be New Years Day. 

I will take my holiday on the weekend of 10 January. 

Following the example of the Americans, I propose an additional holiday in February called ""Recovery Day"", when people should return to work after the long Christmas break. This will encourage business and the economy, while encouraging employees to spend time with their families. 

In summary I propose the following dates for the holidays in the coming year: 
- 12 December: Christmas
- 1 January: New Years Day 
- February: Recovery Day


The following individuals have agreed that New Years Day should be a public holiday: 
- Nick Green

The holiday dates requested by D Brown can be divided into two broad groups:
(i) dates available during the Christmas and New Year period (for example, 25 and 26 December);
(ii) dates available during the summer holidays in other years (for example, the dates 21 to 27 June).
By the end of the month, D Brown will have received information from all the members of staff who are likely to have the dates available to them. The information that will be most relevant to D Brown will be: 
(i) whether the dates are available as a whole or are spread over a number of months,
(ii) the length of each individual holiday, 
(iii) any other considerations that might influence the choice of dates, e.g. whether the holiday will be of a sufficient length to allow for sufficient time for a holiday and/or school visits.

The date 22.02.04 has been rejected because it is the day of the week on which staff will be away visiting family in December. Staff would prefer this to be a weekend. 

The date 21.02.05 has been rejected because staff consider it is not sufficiently cold for them to want to go on holiday. 

The date 22.01.06 has also been rejected by staff because they consider the date too close to New Year's Day.

Hilda wakes up the next day and starts talking, and now she can say more words and her eyes are open again. David Reilly  wrote this book in only a few months.

Maha is a nurse in northern Australia where she works in a small hospital. One day a baby is so ill that Maha has to drive all night to get her to the nearest big city. The baby's name is Hilda. Maha finds a home for Hilda with a loving family who will pay her family to take care of Hilda. Maha finds a job too that pays very well"," When she arrives, she has no idea how to find her village and who she can trust. She has no idea what to do. But she has a story to tell. This is the story of Maha and of a baby in need. The Long Night has beautiful text and very well developed characterisation. The setting of northern Australia is rich in detail. There is a lot of potential here for a strong story.


The story must follow these guidelines:

- Start with a prologue that gives context to the setting and characters.
- There will be three main plot points: a baby arrives in Maha's village, Maha arrives in the village but doesn't know the language and there's a medical emergency in the village. The prologue will introduce all three points.
- There will be three subplots: Maha's son wants to study but doesn't have the money for school, a journalist visits Maha's village and discovers that David has a book out about the area, and Maha takes a night off from work to help a family with a medical emergency in their village. The journalist's visit should happen before or around the time of the medical emergency.
- There will be several small subplots. Maha loves fish nuggets, for example. Maha likes her hospital work and is frustrated by the small hospital. Some people who live in the village resent Maha for her new job, and her son's teacher is not"," During her journey Maha sees a mountain with smoke coming out of it and the words ""Dewarlik"" on the mountain. On the mountain there is a well and on the well there is a statue of a man. The man is wearing a red shirt. As Maha gets closer to the city, the air is colder and the roads are snowed in. When Maha gets to the city, she calls the doctor for help. It will take several days for a helicopter to get to the city. Maha cooks for the baby and watches as the sunlight starts to come again. She starts a fire on the road, but it's too cold for the kindling to burn. She looks on the plane of paper and thinks of ways to keep the fire burning. She asks a man on the street if they have a lighter that he could borrow. A man gives Maha a lighter and Maha uses it to keep the fire burning. Maha watches the snow disappear and thinks that when the warm spring comes, she will go to the well and find the statue she saw on the mountain.


This story is short and sweet. It's easy to understand and provides a nice contrast between the heat of the city and the cold of the mountains. The use of similes throughout the story helps to establish the mood. The author uses the word ""like"" a lot to compare the temperature on the mountains, the well, and in Maha's city.


"," As Maha is driving she starts to see strange things - a flying goat, a man who can move objects with his mind - and she starts to wonder if she herself is losing her mind. When Maha gets to the city, she calls David and tells him the story of her night drive. David comes down to the hospital and sees Maha has brought a new book with her - written by a strange man who can talk to animals - and the goat. David reads the book out loud to Maha. It seems to help, and Maha tells David that she will try to write a short story based on the events of the night. David does some research and finds that the man who wrote the book is a former priest who lost his faith. He wrote the book to prove to himself that there is life after death. After this experience, Maha decides to also follow his path and re-find her faith. 

David Reilly - the man who wrote the book - is a former priest who lost his faith. He used to teach English but started to write books to prove to himself that there is life after death. Maha, a nurse in northern Australia, is struggling to care for a baby who is so ill she thinks she might be losing her mind. As she is driving all night to get to the nearest big city, she starts to see strange things - a flying goat, a man with the power to move objects with his mind - and wonders if she herself"," It is February, and Maha starts to get worried that the baby will die before she can find a doctor. But then she sees the baby in a picture. It's her mother. It comes to her in her dreams. The baby tells her that she is not alone and Maha has a sister and a brother. And the baby introduces Maha to her family. This book shows how love can change your life. It can make you a writer. And it makes you a nurse. And it changes everything. And that's why it's called a Long Night.  Reilly is a British author who has written a number of best selling crime and military thrillers. Maha, a nurse in Australia, reading this book is sure to enjoy it.

" It is just part of the ageing process.' Why did I allow him to believe that? Perhaps because it also served my own needs. I had already told myself repeatedly that this was not the time to ask for help and that I would be strong enough to manage. 'It could be something simple like dehydration' I thought. 'We are in a beautiful country' I continued. 'Why would he think otherwise? He is a seasoned traveller, it is probably just the altitude'. The fact that he had not offered help was indeed a sign of his experience. 'Perhaps he has a good bedside manner. After all he has been in the field for so long' I thought. 'I will ask him when I am in a better state of mind.' And so I continued to avoid asking for his help. But then I had an attack that required urgent medical attention. 'We will never know now. I have left the hospital and he is far away'. 'Why did I not ask for his help then? Why did I wait till now? And why did I avoid speaking of my illness at all?'. The answer was simple. I had not wanted to burden him. I had not wanted to ask for help. I had not wanted to speak of my illness. And so I left the hospital with a heavy heart, and once again I started to decline.


The above story is based on actual events and conversations I had with my father, who is now 93 years old,"," I have yet to see a doctor.' And so I continued to tell him my story but my words were not as clear as they should have been. When my son returned home from school one day, I asked him ""How was school?"". He smiled and said 'Fine'. 'What did you learn at school today?' I asked.  'We learned the alphabet', he said, pointing to his alphabet book which he had returned from school that day. 

It was then that my son's smile slowly faded, and his eyes grew cold. 'How is my alphabet book?' he asked. I knew what the answer would be. 

'It is fine', I said, but my words were weaker than the question. 

'What does it look like?' he asked. 

'It is a book', I replied, but my son did not believe me. 

He picked up the book and held it out to me. It was the same book that he had been looking at earlier that day, with the same alphabet images printed on the same page. But this time the book was different. Its pages were dull and shinny. 

'It is new,' he said. 

'Newer than what?' I asked. 

'Newer than yesterday', he answered. 

My heart dropped. 'My son has lent my book to his friend. He told me that it was his favourite book', I said. 

His"," He should be able to see me again by now'. But the truth was I did not want to admit that I needed the help that he offered and so I lied.


In order to write a convincing story that is both accessible to A2 learners and provides a lesson around what happens when we lie, we must first understand what lying is.

Lying is generally defined as the willful covering up of the truth, especially for personal gain. While this definition can help us understand the negative connotations of lying, we also need to acknowledge that there are instances where we must lie in order to protect ourselves and others. An example of this would be if one is a witness in a crime and must decide if they will remain silent so as not to incriminate themselves. 

Lying is not always bad and can actually be an important part of our ability to survive. However, when lying becomes an instinctive way of responding to stress, then it can become a part of us. In our A2 learners scenario, the student did not ask for the help that their friend offered because they were avoiding admitting to their own need for that help. By the time the student realised that they needed the help that their friend offered, it was too late to ask for it.


We can now start to understand the need to lie in the scenario that our A2 learners scenario, however one key question that we still need to answer is why the student lied? 

In order"," I had heard that the symptoms can take many weeks to show themselves.'

The illness was certainly a mystery to me. I felt feverish, shivering and constantly woke up sweating. 'Ask him for help' the thought kept repeating in my mind and my lips moved. I heard my voice saying, 'Help me'.

He smiled and replied, 'you are quite well'.

He has a way of speaking in his sleep and muttering the same words again and again. He has cast a few horoscopes and I remember he told me that there was a war on in some part of the world.

The story you have written uses basic sentence patterns with memorised phrases, uses explicit information and limited number of information points. Your text therefore meets the requirements to be assessed as A2 level text.


## Discussion

Your text can be assessed as A2 level text if it:

* uses basic sentence patterns with memorised phrases
* uses explicit information
* uses limited number of information points

Basic sentence patterns with memorised phrases are used to underline the important facts, ideas and observations you make in a story. The use of explicit information indicates that you present only facts, and avoid unnecessary descriptions or examples which may detract from the flow of the text. And last but not least, your limited number of information points indicates that the text is concise.

" Many thanks again. Yours sincerely, A guest.

Tony is a local businessman and Lynne is his wife. They have three children. Tony is a really warm and lovely person and is clearly proud of what his family have achieved. Lynne seems a really fun person to be around and you can tell they love what they do. Her husband is very supportive too.

It is clear that they genuinely do like having someone stay with them and it is clear that they are proud of what they do and are a credit to their community. They clearly enjoy giving back and it is easy to see why they have been voted UK's Greatest Family for the last 10 years.

Lynne and Tony: The UK's Greatest Family is published by Quercus (https://uk.ipadosite.com/quercus) and is read by thousands of people across the UK and beyond.

The story written using this prompt:

Dear Lynne and Tony I'm writing to say thank you for the two nights I stayed in your lovely home. It was good to see you again. Here are the photographs of your children that you asked for. They're good photos aren't they? I hope you like them. I really love my new camera. Many thanks again. Yours sincerely, A guest.

Tony I love the photos of your children. They are lovely. I really like my new camera too. It is a good one."," I've been really busy lately so I didn't have a chance to spend much time with my family but I hope we can spend more time together in the future. Love, Your friend, Jane. 
Dear Jane, 

Here are two photographs of your children:

*	Your son hugging his parents
*	Your daughter with a happy smile

In the above passage, ""your"" refers to ""you and Tony and your children"".

The passage is structured in the form of a letter, which is a good style for a story that is addressed to a specific person. The passage starts by introducing the writer and then describes what the writer wanted, i.e. the photographs. This is followed by the writer's reply.

This story is aimed at children in Grades 2 and 3, although it is a little too juvenile for a Grade 1 pupil.


Dear Lynne and Tony, 

Thank you for the photographs of your children.  They are great pictures and I like them very much.

I enjoyed staying with you last night and I hope to do that again soon.

My friend Jane.


Dear Jane, 

Your friend Jane has been staying with us the last couple of nights. Her children are great fun and they keep her very busy. She seems to spend most of her free time with them.

She has a lot of interesting photographs of her children, some of which you can"," By the way, do you have any children?

The above is for a standard greeting card.  

The story can be told from Lynne's point of view, Tony's point of view, or a combination of both. You can write a first person story if you want.  But the most common way of writing a letter like this is from a third person point of view, written by Lynne to Tony.   Here is an example of a letter from Lynne to Tony: 

Dear Tony, I hope you received my recent letter. I hope you are well. I was so sorry to hear about the accident. I wonder if the crash caused any internal injuries? I hope the doctors have given you the all clear to return to work soon. I enjoyed meeting your children and the photos are great. Please do share the good news when you get home from the doctors! Kind regards Lynne 
This letter is written from the point of view of Lynne, a friend of Tony's.  Tony is described as a friend of Lynne.  This is the standard letter format for expressing gratitude.  The letter can also include a birthday greetings (below), a personal note or a few lines from a favourite poem to help bring tears to Tony's eyes.

" He thinks that having plans for the day could be a cause because most people don’t check on their doors and windows when they go out in the morning. He says that the best way to make sure your house is safe from thieves is to not leave a window unlocked or a door left open. Also, do not leave spare keys around as people are not always careful when they leave and might still have them. And finally, keep your property secure by not letting your garden look attractive to burglars. They’ll have to climb over your fence and then try to open your gate, which has a lock, to get to your house. By not making your garden look nice they’ll just stay and wait for you to come home. They’ll be much less likely to break into if you don’t even let them know you’re interested. A burglar will definitely be less likely to try to break into your house if your neighbours don’t tell them that you’re expecting company. He recommends a book called “Breaking and Entering: How to be a more effective Burglar” by Daniel Abraham and Michael Chabon, which if you enjoyed the “Hunger Games” trilogy definitely check it out. Happy reading!

If you like the challenge, please share this post on social media. And for more writing exercises, visit these pages: https://goo.gl/6s8q3K and https://goo.gl/"," The criminals then wait for the occupants to return and are then able to get into the house. He added that when the house is empty most burglars will search the house, especially if there are valuable items to steal. He also said that burglars sometimes break into empty houses to steal copper pipes that can be used to sell drugs. Other crimes such as carjacking and home invasions are also more likely to happen at the end of the day. One of the downsides of going out in the afternoon is that people usually don't think that burglars are around but once someone is burgled they usually expect it to happen again.


Use the following passage to write a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners:

Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window.

BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a"," When the burglars find people out they have gone out, they are likely to leave a light on or the TV on so they will be unable to hear the door. He added that when people come home at this time they will probably not see or hear anything suspicious. But when the burglars return later in the evening they will find the burglar alarm has been turned off. This is an easy thing for people to do. The alarm is easy to turn off, and it is often a panic button that people push rather than picking the alarm off the alarm panel. The police are on hand and able to use the code to allow access, and the damage is minimal - a TV or laptop that people can not afford to replace. So why do burglars prefer to come at this time? To answer this question we need to look at how humans spend their day. On average we spend about 8 hours a day either working or sleeping. After our working hours we may have a meal and spend some time with our family. The hours after dinner are known as the evening hours. During the evening we often do entertaining, watching TV, or reading. We might attend a social function or go to a club. During the evening we often spend time with friends or family. This is in contrast to the morning hours which we spend either getting ready for work or sleep, or socialising.The evenings are our leisure hours. We might do some physical exercise or read a book. We might watch a television"," I think it's because burglars like the afterno

Burglars Love the Afternoon
The police inspector said that burglars like to strike around the lunchtime because people are typically a bit more relaxed and more vulnerable. He said that burglars love the afternoon because then there is often less attention and usually a nice supply of snacks for when they are able to catch someone unawares.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is a readability measurement for text based on sentence length, typeface, and usage.

Here is a Grade Level comparison of your paragraph with and without the rewrite:


The prompt is followed by the third paragraph of your story with the rewrite:

Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people"," Another 27% happen during the afternoons when people are away on holiday. Still another 6% of burglars like to burgle between dinner and bedtime. He says that even though people are at home the burglars still find ways into the houses. He said one reason is that burglars often prefer to enter through an open window or door. He also says that the longer the burglars are in the house the easier it is for them to find something of value. Inspector Saunders said they are also looking for two kinds of burglary tools. First is a pry bar. These are often used to force open a dead lock or a bolt. Another is a set of lockpicks. These are special picks that can open most modern locks. He says that burglars who know what they are doing will go to a lot of trouble to avoid using tools that can be detected with metal detectors. Instead they will often use crowbars or hammers. He says that the combination of the lack of a useful lock and the right tools makes a burglar an effective and bold criminal. 

You should explain that, in some areas of the UK, it is commonly believed that burglars prefer to burgle during the afternoon hours between 2pm and 6pm. During these hours most people have returned from their leisure time (going out to eat dinner, or going on a leisurely walk) and are at home during this time. Thus, it is thought that burglars might prefer this"," The police say that one of the reasons for the increase in burglaries is the increase in sales of burglary tools and the growth of street gangs. Inspector Saunders said the streets are now riddled with groups of teenage boys, called Youngers, who commit burglary together. He said, ""They carry the tools for the jobs in a fake arm or leg, so the police always think they are police themselves and don't search them too thoroughly. The younger they are the more dangerous they are."" He said the police are working hard to get the gangs busted and bring them to justice, but the boys aren't too concerned about being caught. The burglars like it best when there is nobody around. He said, ""That way they don't have to worry about being heard and can get away more quickly. If there is someone in the house they prefer it is one of the female members like mothers or housekeepers. They are easier to steal from as they're weaker than men and are slower to react to a threat."" There are several ways of stopping housebreakings, one of the most effective being the purchase of a burglarproof door or window for every room of the house. This is quite expensive and only really effective in preventing many of the most serious housebreakings, as the thieves know that they will not be able to get into most of the house and will waste a lot of time trying to break in through doors that are already well protected.  


Bur"," The burglars then pose as sales people and ask to look at goods. Some of the houses in my street were broken into a few weeks ago. They took some watches, some rings and some jewellery but I think the worst thing about it is that they broke the door of the gun cabinet. They took the gun out of the cabinet and it was one of my son's guns and he's a soldier. He'd just had the gun in for cleaning. I know my son because he works at the local farm shop and they do a great selection of guns and weapons. 

Burglars typically use a simple set of pattern sentences to memorise the phrases they need when committing a burglary: - Break into house at x-time. - The time the burglar likes most is after 2 p.m. - In my street, the majority of burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Say the police. - During the last few weeks, 67% of burglaries have happened when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window. - The burglars posed as sales people and asked to look at goods - The watches, rings and jewellery that were stolen were my son's. He works at the local gun shop and they do a good selection of guns and weapons.

Otters are very curious animals. When they see something that catches their eye, they will swim over to investigate it. Otters usually look for food by feeling with their paws. They will take a bite out of almost anything that they find interesting. Otters do live near rivers so it is easy for them to find food. 

The hardest part of being an animal is not seeing your home every day. Otters sometimes get lost and have to stay in the water for days until they are found. It is sad for otters to get lost but they are usually found very soon. In a few days their fur grows back and they can start living again.

" He loves visiting India. 'That one is a tough one. I'm going there soon but that might change when my partner's mum invites me to her house for Christmas. She lives in Goa, which is near India.' India is known for being a tolerant and friendly country but there are some religions that Nick isn't keen to visit. 'There is one religion that I would much rather avoid. It's called Hinduism and it believes that all cows are equal. No animal is more equal than another and they believe it is wrong to kill any animal for any reason. I can't visit India then.' India has many different cultures and Nick would rather not offend any of them. But he admits it is an amazing and fascinating country that he wants to experience. 'I'm going to Goa for Christmas. I'll stay with my partner's family and we'll eat Indian food and take Hindu pilgrims around a temple. I'll make a bottle of red wine from their grapes and that should make me content for the first time in years.' Nick knows that some people may not understand his choice to avoid visiting India. 'People will think I'm being silly but I find India extremely fascinating and, as a British man, I just think I'm entitled to my cultural preferences. India is an amazing place and I'll certainly be back to visit. Who knows, I might even make it as a tourist! I just hope my partner's family will still allow me to come. Good","  'I'd like to go to the Galapagos Islands. I've always wanted to see wildlife in the wild - especially penguins. And of course I'd like to visit Tokyo.' 

Nick loves to travel and to meet new people. He'd especially like to meet people who like wildlife and penguins. What does Nick need to do to make these trips happen? 

First of all Nick should find some friends who would like to go with him. Perhaps they can invite some other friends. Perhaps he can make an online friendship and invite them along to his trips. Then he can look at tour operators who might be willing to take his group on a tour of some of the places he'd like to visit. He can then make travel arrangements. 

At home, Nick can work on having a plan for his travels. He could work out when the next flight is to a certain place and take the next flight. Or, he could plan ahead and find a van or trucking company to take his group to the places they want to visit. He can also consider hiring a driver to take his group of friends when they visit a new place. 

Nick's plans need to include what he does during his trips. He could plan to take plenty of photographs and videos. He could cook some meals while he is there. Or, he could go swimming or try some of the wildlife spotting activities there. 

Once his plans are in place he needs to"," He wants to visit some of the planets most dangerous volcanoes. Nick thinks that would be an amazing experience and it would be a great challenge for him. When the volcanoes erupt it could be quite dangerous but Nick is sure that he could handle that if he went to such places. Nick has put his plans in place to fund the trip. He has decided to go solar and use his savings to fund his adventure.


Travelling to dangerous planets is not an easy task. The planets might be dangerous but for Nick it would be a great adventure. He needs to save some money and use his solar car to go as far as possible each day. The problem is that Nick does not know how long it takes to get to some of the planets most dangerous volcanoes. To find out he needs to make a plan which includes calculating the distance between the planets most dangerous volcanoes and the location of the solar car. Then he will need to make sure that the solar car has enough fuel to get to all the dangerous planets. Luckily, Nick knows how to program his solar car.


Nick starts by calculating the distance between planets most dangerous volcanoes and the solar car location. He uses the formula for the distance in terms of time: time = distance / speed. He finds the speed of sound by dividing one over the gravitational force of the planet he is currently on. He then finds the distance between the planets most dangerous volcanoes using the formula for the distance in terms of time"," The first is to Australia, which he has heard is a very open and friendly country. The second is to China, which is still recovering from the devastating SARS epidemic and he would love to take some business there. And the last trip he would really like to make is to New York. He has always wanted to visit the city and the cultural events happening right now. Nick's list of places to visit includes: Australia, China and New York. Which country would Nick visit first? New York. He could do his business in China, travel around that country and then finally visit New York, where there is the Oscars next month. When it comes to the three countries, New York has the most connections with Australia and China, so these countries would come first. He would probably visit Australia last, as there are not a lot of connections to China. He can do a round trip between London, where he lives, and China and there is a good chance he could get to New York this way. While he is in Australia he could visit New York through either Australia or Hong Kong. He would probably go to Australia first, as he could visit both there and China, but he would need to leave the country before travelling to New York. He could do a round trip between London and Hong Kong and then continue from Hong Kong to New York. He could also do a round trip between London and New York, but this could take longer since he will need to travel through a customs border"," 'I would love to take a trip to New Zealand to see the stunning landscapes and vibrant colour. There is so much to see and do, it would be a shame not to experience it all.' 

World traveller Nick Barlow loves his work. He's a British actor and he travels around the world making TV programmes. 'People welcome me everywhere I go and when I get home I remember all the wonderful things that happened in each country.' 

Nick has travelled to many places but there are a few trips that he would still like to make. 'I would love to take a trip to New Zealand to see the stunning landscapes and vibrant colour. There is so much to see and do, it would be a shame not to experience it all.' 

Nick would love to take a trip to New Zealand. He thinks that the country has so many beautiful places to visit. He's watched movies about the place and has even read some books. New Zealand offers great activities for visitors, such as seeing the country's beautiful landscapes and visiting its popular landmarks. Nick would also be able to experience different cultures, as many New Zealanders speak English rather than Māori. Nick's final recommendation is to see as many of the beautiful beaches as possible.

Nick Barlow loves his work. He's a British actor and he travels around the world making TV programmes. 'People welcome me everywhere I go and when I get home I remember all the wonderful things that happened in each"," 'I would like to visit North Korea, because I've heard it's a beautiful place. It's also interesting to see if the internet actually works there.' 

North Korea is one of the most remote and secretive countries in the world. It's a one party state and there is very little information about it. 'I will just have to find out for myself,' says Nick. He starts by booking a flight for October. 

'Flights to North Korea are still difficult to access but several airlines offer direct flights each month, with a few more airlines connecting via China,' says Nick. China has the biggest population of any country and is a vital link for any business. 'It's also very likely that the internet will work - at least for my purpose.' 

Nick's work visa allows him to work for any period of time and allows him to visit the country. His work requires him to be in close contact with actors from all around the world, so he wants to travel around North Korea. 

'I will also get a feel for what it's really like to live in the country, learn about the culture and try some delicious food.' North Korean food is very different to the foods enjoyed by people in the UK. 'I know that my hosts in the country will have a great time cooking me a wide range of North Korean food, and it will be a learning experience for me about different dishes across the world.' 

Nick has a very busy"," He would like to visit India and Indonesia. 'The people would be surprised to learn how differently people live around the world. Each country has its own language, customs and music. Indians would surprise him by their warmth and laughter while Indonesians would be a bit more reserved, but the friendliness would be still there.' 

One of the things Nick would like to see in India is the Taj Mahal. 'The Taj Mahal is a beautiful white marble mausoleum dedicated to Shah Jehan, the Emperor of India, who died in Agra in 1683 and was entombed there.' The Taj Mahal is a wonderful monument and it's hard to believe that only 20 years ago many people thought that the mausoleum would never be completed. 

Nick would also like to go to Indonesia. He's heard that the culture is very warm and friendly and he is sure that the people there would be very welcoming. 'Indonesia has some of the best beaches in the world and this is reflected in the many holidaymakers who visit the country each year. They will find that Indonesia is quite diverse in terms of culture and language but the friendliness is still there, just like in India.' 

Nick is a keen traveller and he has many interesting places around the world that he'd like to visit. He is very happy to hear that he will be able to go to these places one day.


The following passage uses basic sentence patterns,"
" The postage costs a lot less than having a holiday too. People often send postcards to friends and family they haven't seen in a long time. Sending a postcard is a way of keeping in contact with someone without having to write a letter and also of letting them know they have been missed. Sending a postcard is one of the quickest ways of showing someone you care. In history postcards were very popular. You could send a postcard with a picture of the Eiffel Tower in front of the Trocadero restaurant in Paris and you would hear from people living nearby. Postcards are still very popular today. They are convenient to send and have a picture on them of a beautiful beach mountain or castle. Postcards can be purchased from many shops or you can upload your own pictures and get them printed. Postcards can also be sent to the USA and Canada. Postcards to the USA or Canada might have a copyright symbol on them but if you remove the symbol you will be able to send the postcard to the USA or Canada. There are some countries that don't accept postcards such as North Korea but postcards are still very popular there. It is very hard to send postcards to countries such as North Korea because there aren't many people in these countries that have postcards. However, many people in these countries have their photos taken and send those photos. Postcards have had a great influence on how people communicate with each other today."," When you are writing a message on a postcard you should write in short sentences and use simple words. One holiday we went to the beach and here are some pictures of the beach. I hope you like them. When you are sending a postcard you can usually add a stamp on the front to prove that the postcard has been sent. People on holiday often like to add postmarks to the back of the postcard so they can tell exactly when it was sent. One postmark says that it was sent in March 2007. Another says it was sent in July. You can use this information in your message on the back of the postcard. One tourist friend said we had a really fun day and the pictures on the postcard are nice. Another friend thinks the pictures are from a different holiday and the postcard is a bit of a joke. We also got some good shots of the castle but our guide wasn't happy with the photos so we will not be going back. We will of course keep you posted on how the castle is when we get back. Thanks for your message and please give our postcard to a friend. Postcards are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family when you are on holiday. Happy Postcarding!

What is a postcard? 
Postcards are small pieces of cardboard with an image printed on the front, usually of a landscape, and a message on the back.

They are very popular for sending emails"," Everyone likes to receive a postcard from someone when they get mail.  

People sometimes write messages on the back of the postcard that they would not normally say to a friend in person. For example some people write messages to their friends and family to let them know they have found a new love of music or a new hobby, to apologize for any mistakes they have made, or to ask them a question that they would otherwise ask their friends face to face.  

Postcards also can be a form of direct marketing. Companies can put postage on postcards and send them to people in a particular area to advertise their products. For example companies in the same town may send postcards to people with brochures to sell their products. There is a difference between sending a postcard to remind someone to buy a product and actually trying to sell them something. Sending a postcard with postage to a person does not constitute an advertisement under the Advertising Act. 

People may send postcards to their friends and family using the internet. Many websites allow people to upload pictures of the pictures they want to send postcards with. Some people will also buy postcards online to send to friends and family. In the future it may be possible to send postcards to people using their smartphones using near field communication.  

In the past people would not send postcards to people in the south of France. There was a postcard post office in London but people had to"," There are a range of postcard companies in the UK that sell postcards online or you can buy postcards from the Post Office.

The postcard companies are... cheaper because they use recycled post cards, have better pictures and"," 

In the past people used to write postcards in a blue postage stamp envelope which often contained white card on which the postcard was printed. This way it was easy to tell if the envelope was postmarked correctly. However, when people started to send their postcards electronically, this caused problems because it was difficult to tell if the postcard had been sent with the right postage if the postcard was not franked. 

Many countries now use special postcards that are the same shape as the blue postage stamp envelope but they are made of a special plastic instead of white card. The postcard does not have the same weight and the postal company can scan the barcode on the back of the postcard and know how much postage was used for sending the postcard. The postcard also has a unique barcode on the back which can be read by scanners and the postcard gets franked automatically when the correct amount of postage has been put on the postcard. 

Some postcards also contain a special chip that the postal company can read to check if the postcard has been sent with the right amount of postage. There is no need to put postage on the postcard and this makes it cheaper for the sender but it also makes it more difficult to cheat the postal company. 

In your story you will have to explain why the sending of postcards became more expensive because of the use of electronic postcards and of special post"," My favourite place to send a postcard from is the island of Cyprus because the pictures on the postcard are very good and you can walk to most places on the card from the main town of Limassol.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale is a literacy tool used by English teachers and others to determine whether material is written at a level appropriate for their students. 
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale measures how easy a material is to understand.  The formula takes word counts from an adapted version of the American National Dictionary for use in educational settings and produces a corresponding grade level.  The formula can be as simple as using sentence length as an approximation.  The word count from the dictionary can also be simplified.  If words are counted in half, then there is an approximate grade level of the material.  Using average word count from a sample of sentences can produce a more precise grade level.  Word counts are derived from the frequency of words within the sentences.  This is very important in determining grade level.  If there are 10 words appearing in the text, then the material is grade 10.  The formula can be applied to both text and individual words.  
Postcards can be broken down into sentences.  Each sentence can be broken down into sentences and each sentence is broken down into syllables.  Syllables also contain words.  The formula","

" It quickly caught on and in the 16th century thoroughbreds were first bred and brought to America. By the middle of the 19th century there were over 600 race courses in the US, Europe had about 200 racecourses and the total population of horses in England and Wales alone was estimated to be about 350,000. Despite the growth of the sport there was little change in how the sport was run because of the difficulty in identifying winners; riders were not required to wear numbering devices. 
With the development of electronic voting in the 20th century there was a move towards a more organized system of keeping records of the race results, which led to a World Championship taking place every four years.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where does modern horse racing come from? 
The modern horse racing came from the Arab horses brought to Europe in the 12th century. It started with a few racecourses in the 16th century. 
During the middle of the 19th century there were over 600 racecourses in the United States, Europe had about 200 racecourses and the total population of horses in England and Wales alone was estimated to be about 350,000. Despite the growth of the sport there was little change in how the sport was run because of the difficulty in identifying winners; riders were not required to wear numbering devices.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Who bred horses and brought them to"," The races themselves go back to ancient Babylon, where chariot races were held in honour of Goddess Ningal. Racing remained unpopular throughout the Middle Ages and until the 17th century had virtually disappeared in England. 

However, the 19th century brought racing great expansion and in 1863 a modern, enclosed course was opened in Britain\'s second-largest city, Liverpool. Racing has continued to develop over the last century and the 21st century has seen horses like Fusaichi Pegasus and Big Buck Hunter become household names.

Racing has also developed into a global sport, with racecourses opening across the world with the growth of air travel. Racing is now an Olympic sport and most countries have a national horse racing authority, with many races being run to attract the economic benefits of tourism. Horse racing is now one of the world\'s most popular sports with fans drawn from the general public and high-profile people in politics, the arts and sport.

However, it took a while before the sport really took off in England. The first reference to a race meeting in England is to a meeting in 1745 on the Green near Newmarket, which is now an important venue for steeplechases. After a slow start in the 18th century racing improved and the first report of the Derby is from 1819. However, it was not until the early 20th century that horse racing really took off. Between 1914 and 1929 there were more race days run than in any year between 1930 and 1939. By the 1950s racing had become the second most popular sport in England, after cricket. In addition, it was one of the main events at the Olympic Games in 1948 and 1952. It continued to develop and, by the 1970s, horse racing was one of the three leading sports in England, alongside football and golf. The most recent major amendments were in 1999 and 2005. The most important rule is that each horse has equal opportunities to run, which means if more horses run first race, the race is drawn after each race, but before the number of wins/placed is less than 5 for the race to count. The most important race to most people is the Derby because the winner will travel to Rome to compete in the Derby Trial. It is a three-stage race, with the first stage being a"," Horses then started to be trained to race them.

Today, horse racing is a very popular sport with almost 50,000 horses racing each Sunday in the United Kingdom alone. Horses race over a long course in a single starting line, in a swirl of dust, with jockeys, drivers and umpires on hand. Racing season begins in January with the Derby race, the most famous event in horse racing, and ends in June with the Grand National, the most famous jockey course racing in the world.

" 'I'm nine years old Dad. I can go with you.' Dad returned and they both talked about the meeting. 'It will be about the funeral. There will be other people who will come too. But it's okay, we'll be back for dinner.' After a while, Jude and Dad returned. I went to get changed but Dad had forgotten to wake me. 'I'm not coming back for dinner' I said. Dad said 'You will when you get to the meeting. Just be a good girl and do as I say.' 'But I'm not coming' I insisted. Dad said 'Yes you are Jude, I'm not going to let anyone fight the fire I started to protect you.' Then I heard the front door close and Mum enter. Dad then came up and said 'I'm sorry, she got pretty upset.' Mum then took me by the hand and lead me to the kitchen. Dad then left the two of them alone. I looked at Mum and she placed a large bowl of popcorn in front of me. I was hungry. So I ate and began to drift away to sleep. I awoke to the sound of Dad's car driving away and suddenly realizing I was alone. I began to cry. Mum then sat down next to me. I began to tell her what had happened. She said that Dad would be back soon but I should wait until it was light out and try to understand what had happened. She then told me that she"," 'Just come if you want to.' 

'I want to' I said. Dad then led me out the door and around the house and into the garage. He then opened the door to a old Ford F-150 truck and helped me get into the back of the truck. Dad then closed the door and drove off. I started to cry. I thought Dad had taken my favourite truck and wouldn't ever be able to take me to the creek on Saturdays to swim. A few minutes later I saw the truck stop in a car park. I stepped out and saw there was another car park beside it. I walked towards the cars and saw Dad had parked the truck in a very small car park with very little room to walk around it. I looked at the truck and saw it said 'Jude in the back'. 'Hey Jude' Dad called. I walked over to the truck. 'How was your day Jude' Dad asked. I told him that I couldn't swim with Mum and Dad anymore because they had taken the truck and Dad didn't know if he'd ever get to take me anymore. Dad then started to cry. 'We'll talk about it when I get home Jude' Dad said. 'I miss you Dad' I said. Dad then put his arms around me and hugged me tight. We then both started to cry. After about a minute Dad said 'I love you Dad'. We then both hugged tight again. I looked back at the"," I begged him, but he wouldn't budge. Then he came back and said: 'I'm going to go over there and see for myself.' Jude and I both sat glum faced, and not very happy at all.

It took a while for Dad to show up. When he did we were surprised. We had hoped he would change his mind, but when he said we should go to the meeting with him we followed him over to the church. 'This is a very serious matter' Dad told us. 'We need to make a plan to prevent this from happening again'. 

'How do we do that?' I asked. 'Well, we need to spread the word that Lynette's death was not an accident. She was killed, and it will be murder unless we stop it. It's time that she gets justice. 

So we started a Facebook group, called Justice for Lynette. I've told everyone we know about it. We've spoken to the police. I've started writing a petition to Parliament, with names of other bereaved parents we know who might help as we were friends with Lynette as well. I've also spoken to a lawyer about taking the case to court.

As we spoke, we were amazed to see our friend who had lived with Lynette, walk in the door. 'I've just left the police' she said. 'They think they have everything under control, but I know Lynette"," 'I'll come once we're through' I added. Dad left the kitchen. 'It'll only take five minutes. And then we'll see' he said. We were both surprised when Dad returned a few minutes later and took our plates and drinks away. He then said a few words to each of us, and we were asked to stand up. As I stood up Dad took me in his arms. I looked around to see Mum was in the kitchen, crying, but there was no one else in the room. I started to cry too, and Dad held me even tighter. 

Jude, Dad and I walk into a building. All three of us are asked to join the back of the room and we are met by two other men. They give us a manila envelope and tell us that this is to deliver a message. The first man speaks, 'We would like to speak to you two, alone, in the back of the room'. We walk back into the front of the room. Dad and I are seated in two rows of chairs while Jude is sitting on the floor. The men have now returned and give Dad and I a paper with a set of instructions written on it. Dad looks really confused, because the instructions are in Japanese. Dad and I both look at Jude, because we don't know what she is feeling. The second man speaks, 'We have a simple proposal. Your father and brother have a remarkable set of genes that could help"," 'But why are you going to a meeting Dad?' 'I'm going to show you a house'. 'Whose house is it Dad?' 'It's the council's house for people who can't afford to heat their own home' 'Can we go to the house with you Dad?' 'No it's very cold outside. Come back soon Dad.' 'I will Jude. Bye' Then I saw Dad leave the room. I looked around and realised this was it, it was happening. I was going to a meeting at the council. I wondered if the other children in the meeting had special needs. Then I realised they were children who were being asked to do stuff for the council. I started crying. Dad returned. 'Why are you crying Jude' he asked. I could not tell him about the council meeting, I felt it was my secret to tell, and I was too young. I decided to go with Dad as he was going to the meeting too. When we arrived at the meeting room, I was frightened and wondered what was going on. Then the man standing up explained there were children in the room who had special needs. My eyesight was normal, but I have a learning difficulty which makes it hard for me to see some things. So Dad sat down at a table to the side so I could join him. Suddenly a lady with a microphone stood up. 'Thank you for being here today to find out about children like Jude who have special needs and"," 'Where's the meeting Dad?' I asked. Dad hesitated. 'It's a secret.' He turned the key in the lock and led me down the hallway. We passed the bedroom and went down the stairs. I heard the sound of papers sliding against each other. 'Oh no' I said. 'Don't worry it's just an architect.' 'An architect?' I asked. 'Just come on.' Dad was leading me to the back door. It was a cold evening and Dad's breath smelt of whisky. We were outside now and Dad opened the gate. The night was quiet and the only sound was the wind blowing through the trees. Dad held out his hand. 'Don't move' he said and he disappeared behind a tree. I felt a strange sensation. Like being underwater. I was scared, but there was something wonderful about being out in the dark alone with Dad. I started to walk along the path. Suddenly a small flash of light. I stopped. I saw Dad, about 10 feet up a tree. 'Come on' he shouted. Dad's face was black with soot. His hair stood up and his clothes were covered in dirt and grass. He handed me a glass bottle full of something red. 'Take it, it's real whisky from America.' We climbed back up to the road. I looked into the glass bottle and could see little specks of something white. 'It's snow!' Dad laughed. Dad took another sip and"," We spoke again later on the phone and Dad told me he was going to a special meeting. 'A meeting about what Dad?' 'He didn't say,' Dad whispered. I waited for another meeting but nothing happened so I decided to go to the meeting. Dad was surprised to see me there and explained that there was no meeting. 'There's an extra place' he said. I was happy about that so Dad, Mum and I all went to a restaurant. It was our favourite place. We ate the best hamburgers. After eating the burgers Dad said 'Well, I'd better go and thank the organiser, then we're off home' The car drove away and all of a sudden there was a loud horn. Dad turned the car around and got out. 'What is it?' he asked. 'Don't you recognise that car?' I pointed at it. 'Oh, yes, it belongs to the lawyer who came to talk to us about the house. We drove past his house today and he was driving back so he honked. I'll call him and thank him then we'll go home.' Dad called the lawyer and thanked him. Dad was very happy about that as he was especially keen to buy the lawyer's new car. Then we went home. The same as before. I asked Dad if the lawyer had a new car. Dad smiled 'yes' and patted me on the head, just like when I was a little boy. I knew"

The Flesch-Kincaid Scale evaluates the number of words, sentences and syllables found in a passage of text. It should be noted that these three metrics are not independent of each other. The following example may give a feel for how the Flesch-Kincaid Scale works. The first metric (number of words) is 100, but the second metric (number of sentences) is only 70. The third metric (number of syllables) is only 50. So, even though the sentence contains 70 words, it is much easier to read (and grade on) than the sentence in the second example, as it only has 50 syllables. 

The number of words, sentences, and syllables in a passage of text can be evaluated using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale.  For this example, we will use a passage from Chaucer's 'The Knight's Tale'.  The following table provides the Flesch-K"," 'What country is that?' 'Spain.' 'I don't know that country,' replied Don Quixote. 'It's a huge country. The biggest country in Europe.

Edward the Confessor went to war with Harold, fought in a battle that made no difference, lost his brother and his throne, and promised himself that he would rule God's kingdom through the grace of God alone, without the help of any crown. After that Edward the Confessor lived a good life in prayer and contemplation, and died suddenly of a heart attack, which the church said was the will of God for his life.

After this Bill has sold many books and he is very happy. He tells his wife that he will retire from the farm and become a writer full time.

After he has finished the corrections he types the text with the new corrections into the electronic typewriter which he has attached to the wall of his study. He sends the text by mail to the publisher who then prints a few hundred copies. The children’s books are then given to the school librarian who hands them out to the children.

"  Some people say that line dancing is a good way to burn calories. 'I love dancing and it is great exercise. I've lost three stone since I started line dancing and I've been line dancing for two years' Jodie Smith another dancer says. 

'Line dancing is a good way to improve your fitness. It can keep you fit and keep your muscles in shape. It is not as intense as some other forms of exercise but it is a good way to keep fit and healthy.' Dancing instructor Diana Cope says.

There are classes and clubs across the country for all levels of dancers. Line dancing has been on the rise in Britain. 'I love line dancing and you will find me at a line dancing club most evenings. The exercises are great for the body and mind.' Maria from Bristol says.

People of all ages can start line dancing, young children can enjoy it too. It has been popular with people of all ethnic backgrounds and backgrounds. 'Line dancing is a good exercise. It doesn't burn as many calories as other forms of exercise but it does tone your muscles and is good cardio too!' Louise from London says.

Line dancing is not as difficult as some other forms of exercise like going to the gym or running. 'If you learn the steps you can do line dancing anywhere. There are loads of places you can learn line dancing. Line dancing is a good way to keep fit and healthy!' Emma from London says."," 'I love it, you take your shoes off and you just hop around the dance floor, I love it.' Many people think line dancing is easy and quick. 'Line Dancing could help dementia sufferers keep their memory sharp, according to a new study.' The research followed 150 people with mild to moderate dementia, who took part in six two-hour group sessions where they learned to line dance.  'Line dancing is all about body awareness, making sure you move your body in the right way and keeping the beat so you and the music connect.' The researchers said the 'exercises and social activity helped with depression and anxiety in people with dementia.' The research was presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Philadelphia.

I wonder how many dementia sufferers can now line dance? How about you try it.

'Line dancing could help dementia sufferers keep their memory sharp, according to a new study.'

'"," As it's such a simple activity it makes it really easy to understand what you are supposed to do. You line dance by going forwards and backwards in a circle. That's all there is to it. 'That's not really line dancing is it?' the man who runs the local club says. 'That's more like jumping around.' 'That's exactly what you're doing,' she replies. 'Line dancing is not about fancy steps. It's all about bringing your whole body together and just moving.' Most beginners make mistakes too. 'My hips go one way and my shoulders go another but I still look like I'm moving,' one young woman says. Another woman says that when she does a line dance with her partner it feels more like muscle memory than real movement. 'We do it at home all the time,' she says, 'It just feels right. I don't know how to do this sort of thing!' That's what the man who runs the club says — 'I knew this was going to be hard but when I tried it it felt right.'  

What does it mean by 'line dancing is easy to learn'?  
Line dancing is easy to learn if you have two feet and can walk then you can do it.  
Line dancing is easy to learn if it's a simple activity and you just bring your whole body together and move.

  * Easy to learn: 'Line dancing is easy to learn. If you have two feet and can walk then you can do it!' Fiona Lever a teacher says"," She has been teaching line dancing for over 20 years and says that with enough commitment and practice, you could be dancing in no time. Although it may seem simple, line dancing requires core body coordination, which is learned through exercise and repetitive practice. 'With line dancing you need good movement patterns, balance and timing' explains Linda Hulme, a dance teacher. She says that you should start by taking lessons or sign up for group classes. Then get yourself a pair of old shoes or new sports trainers, find a rhythm song and start practicing at a local club. 'Line dancing develops your core coordination and your rhythm' Linda says. Another benefit of line dancing is that it will help people to stay healthy as it is fun and makes people want to exercise. 'It is very good for the heart. With every 20 minutes of physical activity you can reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke by 8%. It is also good for the lungs as it increases blood flow to the lungs and improves breathing' a cardiologist from Oxford University says. It is easy to learn line dancing if you have heard it before as it requires just basic body coordination. 'If you want to learn line dancing, it is not hard. With enough commitment and practice you can do it' a dancer says. However, there are some clubs that do not teach dance, they just show people line dancing. This does not mean that they are not good dancers, they are just not taught the specific technique. You can"," Her pupils agree, 'Oh yes, it's really fun. You just need to find a class that you like and a club that's near you.'

  *"," The step pattern is the same for most lines. The steps form a pattern which makes it easier to follow. Some people might say that learning to line dance is easy. After all, you just need to step and repeat the pattern. That is not the case though. Learning to line dance is not easy. The pattern is easy to follow but the choreography depends on the music which makes it more complex. Line dancing has two main elements. One is called lead which is the movement of the feet from one step to the next. The other element is called follow. This means that as you move your feet from one step to the other you must also move your body so that you are always following the rhythm of the music. Follow the rhythm means to move as if you are dancing the steps of the line. You don't have to be able to move your body exactly like a professional dancer, but you do need to understand that each step must lead to the next in a smooth rhythm. This is difficult to achieve unless you are able to move to the music. Many people find it relaxing to be able to follow the rhythm of the music. You don't have to try to move like a dancer but you do need to understand that the steps must lead to the next in a smooth rhythm. This is called syncopation. In syncopation you find the beat in the music is not totally regular but there is a change in the pattern of the beat. This is difficult to follow as"

  Ann was trembling and her heart was beating furiously. She glanced around and saw all the animals of the jungle watching. She heard a lion growl at her.

 Kong picked up Ann and took her over the next ridge to the village. As they drew closer she saw there was a large crowd gathered around the village square. She saw Ann's father and mother standing there and she had a bad feeling. As Kong stepped into the square she saw her father was holding a spear pointed at her and he was talking to a man in a white dress. The man held a book and the man with the white dress was the schoolmaster. She was shocked but her first thought was to stay low and hide. But then she saw the children. They were looking at her with curiosity and she saw some of them point and smile. The lion was sitting watch nearby and he seemed to approve. So she started to talk to the children. She told them about Ann and talked about how happy she was to be back with her family and that Ann would soon be their school teacher. 
  The lion seemed to approve of this as well and kept watch while Kong spoke. He seemed to be her best defender. Then the man with the white dress asked Ann's father who they were, who spoke to them and what the lion thought of this.

That evening, as Papa and Annie were going to sleep under the giant oak tree, Kong came and sat under that tree. Papa asked him why he had not visited them before. Kong said he had been busy fighting with all the monkeys in the area.

Annie looked at her father and smiled. She knew that was not true. She could see her father and Kong sharing a look. ""Please come often Papa,"" she said.

Kong then left the tree and went back to his home. Papa smiled as he put his head on Annie's shoulder. They both went to sleep very happy.

Annie knew her story was over. She woke up and Papa told her he was going to get some wood for the fire. She went back to sleep.

The next morning, Annie was surprised to see the pile of wood Papa had brought her. Then she saw the ax in his hands. She grabbed his arm.

They stopped at noon when the sun was high in the sky. The jungle was quiet and Kong let Ann explore. The ground was covered with high grass, but he knew that she would find a clearing. He lay on the ground and watched her as she played in the tall grass. 

Ann ran over to a tree and sat with her back against the tree and her legs dangling over the tall grass below. She sat with her eyes closed and slowly her breathing became slower and deeper. She was soon asleep. 

Ann opened her eyes to the sound of a bird singing and the warm sun on her back. She looked up and saw Kong watching her. She leaped to her feet and ran over to him. She jumped up onto his back and he flew with her through the trees.

People still talk about the giant today and say that he will come down the hill one day to take revenge on the man who cut out his tooth.

	This giant lived a long time ago and he lived in a town called Sherborne. One day a man came up the hill to cut wood and as he was cutting the wood the giant came up behind him and fell on his knee and cut his wood. The giant was so big that people in the village were scared of him. After this the giant came up the hill often to look at the village. One day the giant came up the hill as the man was watering the plants in the village square. The giant smiled at the man and took his bowl of water and started to drink from it. After a while the bowl was empty and the giant thanked the man and then turned and walked back down the hill. The giant still comes down the hill to this day and he will come to the village where the man lived and the man will see the giant. The man will be so surprised that he will drop what he is doing and run away. The giant will laugh"," There is an old legend that the picture is of the man who was the biggest man in history but he was turned into a giant after a battle in the middle ages.

  The black rhino is a very big rhino. Their bodies can reach 800 lbs. They live in Africa. They are very smart and can think for themselves. 
The white rhino is also a very big rhino. Their bodies can reach 750 lbs. They live in Africa and Asia. 
The less known Asian rhino is the next biggest. They can reach 700 lbs. They live in Asia. The horns on the Asian rhino are made of keratin, the same material as our skin. So Asian rhinos have no real need to protect themselves. Asian rhinos are not as dangerous as the black rhino.  
The last rhino is the Southern African rhino. Their name is the rhino, which lives in Southern Africa. This is the smallest rhino at 200 lbs. Southern African rhinos don’t have horns. They get their strength from their trunks. Southern African rhinos live in more peaceful times. 
  As you read these words there are less and less white rhinos. They no longer live in Africa. Africa is becoming more and more dangerous to live in for the rhinos. The governments of the world can’t protect the rhinos from man. A man called David Krumholtz came up with an idea to put money on black rhino horns so poachers would stop killing the rhinos. He started the horn trade that lead to the extinction of the rhino. 
  Mr. K"," A baby rhino looks just like a baby hippopotamus. Rhinos are the largest kind of rhino. They are also the most peaceful and live in the open fields and forests. 
One day a baby rhino was playing in the open field. Suddenly a lion and a tiger heard the noise. They came running and wanted to get the baby rhino for their dinner. The baby rhino started to run very fast and very quickly. The tiger and the lion started to run after the baby rhino but the baby rhino was very strong. The tiger and lion were still a long way behind the fast running baby rhino. At last the baby rhino reached the forest and was safe in the forest. The tiger and lion did not know where the baby rhino could have gone. The baby rhino could live happy in the forest.


The rhino played in the open field because it was very young and didn't know the dangers of the forest.


The rhino's body is heavy because it has a large amount of dense muscle which helps it to push forward. The rhino's skin is very hard and protects it from many dangers in the world. The rhino's four short legs help the rhino to run fast.

It loves being hugged by mothers with their babies. When the babies are born they have a white patch on their skin. The rhino protects the babies from all kinds of enemies. Once the babies are old enough they start to eat plants. The biggest rhino, the one that is hunted for the fur, has two big black horns on its head. The Black and White Rhino was once very common but is now endangered. Some think that the reason for its decline is the number of humans who live in its territory. The Black Rhino can have a baby every three years. The population of Rhinos is not enough to sustain the hunters. They hunt the Rhinos because they need their horn for different purposes. A single white rhino horn can sell for millions of dollars. The horn helps a person get high for the elephant's dung. A single black rhino horn can help a person get high for wealth and power. The white rhino does not get high from the elephant's dung, it is not related to black rhino. The number of rhinos is slowly increasing.


The Black and White Rhino live in the open fields of Africa. The others live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have big heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short"," The babies usually have long legs because their legs need to get used to the big body. There are two subspecies of rhino: the Dwarf and the Hottentot. The Hottentot rhino is much smaller than the Dwarf rhino. Hottentots do not live as far from the river so their food supply is better. The rhino is not as scary as people think. There is a real difference between the size of the leg and the size of the leg of a rhino. A small baby rhino has shorter legs. The babies learn to run after a while. They learn to hop on the big leg and start climbing on top of the trees.

Rhinos live in all countries in Africa and Asia. They are not found in South America.

 The rhino the Dwarf and Hottentot rhino live in Asia. They live in forests. They can run very fast and jump very high. But they are not very big. The Black and White rhino live in Africa. They live in the open fields. They are bigger than horses. You can see them from a long way away. They have big bodies and big legs. But their skin is very hard and they do not have much hair.

 The other type of rhino is the Sloth Rhino. It lives in the jungles in South America. You will not see it in Africa or", They have two horns on their head. One on top of the other. The head of the rhino has about 20 different special senses. The rhino can hear 100 times better than humans. It can smell up to 20 miles away. It can taste up to 20 miles away. And it can see as far as 20 miles. The rhino is the tallest animal on the earth. It can grow up to 15 feet. Its weight is about 10 tons. And its neck is even longer than its body. The horn grows only on one side of the rhino head. When the rhino grows old it loses the horn and can’t be a real rhino anymore. The horn protects the rhino. The horn also signals the rhino to fight. It's the only animal with a horn. When the horn grows it grows fast. The rhino can get a new one and still be a young rhino. But the old rhino can't use the horn anymore. The rhino life is fast. It’s 20 to 30 years between birth and old age. When the rhino is born it can drink from the mother's milk without problems. The rhino needs warm weather to have a good fur and to grow fast.

The reason is that their habitat has been reduced and their numbers are declining because of poaching. This is why we are going to talk about the black rhino. The rhino live in Africa. There are two different kinds of the black rhino. The female black rhino gives birth to one baby every two years on average. It is a very rare baby that is born into the world each year. The baby will depend for the first six weeks of its life on its mother for food.  After that it will start to eat things like antelope milk and also insects. The baby starts to walk after eight months. The males rhino live in separate groups from the female. When the male is ready to get married he will go to a female and ask for her permission to be mating with her. The female will decide if she will allow the mating by looking at her husband’s horns. The male will put the horns of the female close to his and when they get close to hers a signal will be given to start mating.

Many people don't want to see the horns because they look scary but they are very important to the rhino. The rhino have smaller babies that are completely helpless. They help the mom with raising the baby while eating leaves and other things. In some cases the rhino even spend time with other baby rhino. When the babies are older they get busy with the mom and try to protect the babies with their own horn. In some cases the horn gets broken. Many people that see the rhino are very afraid. In many books and on TV shows the rhino are shown as very scary animals with big teeth and big feet. But all rhino in the world today are gentle and they are protected by laws in many countries. The story is about two baby rhino that meet in the open field. The Black and White Rhino they see a lot of in Africa today, the other type of rhino live in Asia. They are very happy they find a new baby in their field to eat and sleep next to. But the baby Black and White Rhino see something different, the other rhino has smaller babies, they are different and have more trouble to find food for themselves.

" Many scientists believe that there were several different kinds of dinosaurs that lived at the same time. They probably looked a lot like dinosaurs you may have seen in a book or on television. Some scientists think that dinosaurs might have looked a bit like the creature from the movie Jurassic Park. Dinosaurs are very interesting animals. They had big strong teeth and sharp claws and could run very quickly. Scientists are still learning a lot about dinosaurs today.


Scientists have been able to find fossils of dinosaurs, which are the bones of dinosaurs that died long ago. Scientists think that dinosaurs first came into being about 200 million years ago, during the Jurassic period.  Dinosaurs were the biggest animals that ever lived. Dinosaurs were plant-eaters, not animal-eaters like today's birds or mammals.  Dinosaurs probably looked a bit like T-Rex, the famous movie monster, which is also from the Jurassic period.


Scientists have found fossils of many different kinds of dinosaurs. Many scientists believe that there were different kinds of dinosaurs that lived at the same time.


Many scientists think that the dinosaurs all died because of a big meteor that fell to earth, millions of years ago, and they all died because they were all near the falling meteor.  Nobody knows for sure why the dinosaurs all died, but scientists think it had something to do with the meteor, because the dinosaurs"," Some had big teeth like a dog. Some had small teeth like a cat. Some had toothless bite. There are different ways of making a bird like body. One way is by using down and feathers. Some scientists think that dinosaurs were made of birds because they had feathers and bird-like bodies.

In the early 20th century many scientists believed that dinosaurs were birds. They had some similarities in the way they moved, the way their feathers were structured, and their teeth. 

In the 1920's a scientist called Dr. Othniel Marsh found many similarities between birds and dinosaurs, but some differences too. 

By the 1960's Dr.unsheepers believed that dinosaurs were actually not birds, and that they were not related to birds.

More recent research has looked at the DNA of birds and dinosaurs. it has been found that birds and dinosaurs are not closely related, and most likely are different species.

A fossil find in a German mine is revealing some surprising new information about dinosaurs. Scientists have found evidence that they were more complex than previously thought, living close to humans and feeling pain. The scientists believe that the animal found in the mine could be a ""missing link"" between dinosaurs and birds.

Researchers at the University of Bonn have been studying a fossil from a mine in Germany which may contain evidence of an important transitional form between dinosaurs and birds.

The scientists say"," There were a lot of different kinds of dinosaurs. Some people think dinosaurs may have been like the T-Rex in the movie Jurassic Park, with big teeth and long hair. Dinosaur eggs were probably just like chicken eggs. Nobody has ever found one of these eggs. Nobody knows for sure where dinosaur eggs lived. Some people think dinosaurs might have laid their eggs in a nest somewhere, like a robin. Some animals lay their eggs in nests. Some birds are like robins and others are not. Dinosaur eggs may be buried under the ground, under a lot of dirt and rock. There might even be something like a nest under the ground where dinosaur eggs lived.  

A2 learners might understand this if they have heard about dinosaurs in a story, seen a dinosaur picture, read a book about dinosaurs, or seen the dinosaur movie Jurassic Park. However, they would not understand why dinosaurs died, where dinosaur eggs lived, or what type of eggs might be buried under the ground.  They would probably not be able to understand much of the article.
The science is beyond A2 and this article tries to provide only background information to help readers understand what dinosaurs are and why they died.  There is more information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs lived a long time ago. Nobody knows exactly when they died, but some scientists"," There were different kinds of dinosaurs with different sizes. Some people say dinosaurs were not really animals. They think they are just big plants that died and grew big like trees.


Dinosaurs: They are just big plants that died and grew big like trees.

"," There were different sizes and shapes, some had big horns on their heads, some had long tails and some looked just like you and me. Dinosaurs were very happy in their forests. They had big forests, with lots of trees and lots of trees provided them with all the food they needed. One day there was a big bang and everything turned upside down. All the big trees fell down and there was not enough food to survive. Dinosaurs started to die out. Their remains were found in a coal mine in China about 150 years ago. They have been identified as Sinornithosaurus. They were the biggest dinosaurs, probably about 9 feet long. In fact one of the scientists who studied their remains, said he was very surprised to find such big dinosaurs. They did not know that dinosaurs could get that big. There are many theories about why the dinosaurs died, for example, there was a big asteroid that hit their forest and it wiped them out. But nobody knows for sure yet. The only thing we do know is that there are not any dinosaurs left, all the animals are dead, all the dinosaurs and birds are dead, there are only fossils left. They are very sad. Some scientists say that maybe if we find a way to put lots of coal together and burn it, then maybe dinosaurs will come back again. It might be a bit dangerous, but it could be a good idea to do it. If it happens again, we"," Some had long legs, some short legs, some had arms and some had nothing on their bodies at all. All dinosaurs were probably covered with hair.

Words"," The second piano teacher had no formal training in music, but he was a brilliant improviser who taught Ivan and his sister new music every day. His third music teacher was a famous concert pianist who taught the Petrovs theory and played Bach and Chopin for them. The teacher organised recitals in their hometown. Ivan Petrov knew many songs by Chopin and many of them were part of his improvisation. His mother was very happy that Ivan was able to perform at all. He loved music, especially when he could use all his knowledge of theory to make music based on improvisation. At school he passed exams and began training in mathematics. In school and university Ivan received excellent grades but was never a fan of school and his grades dropped when he needed to look after his sister.

My first music teacher was not well educated, but he was an excellent improviser. After three years of studies in Poland, we returned to our village.

" It was covered with flowers. ""Why all these flowers?"" he wondered. Then he saw a pretty little girl playing in the flower field. She was so happy to see Pedro that she ran up to him and threw her arms around him. The two of them happily talked for a while, laughing and looking at the many flowers. Pedro asked the child if anyone else lived on the island. She shook her head. ""No one else lives on the island because no one else survived the shipwreck."" Pedro was shocked. ""But why?"" he asked. ""The captain thought he was past the island when they were sailing by it. But the wind changed and suddenly there was a storm and the ship was completely lost. Everyone on the ship was lost."" Pedro was completely taken aback. ""No,"" he said, ""I am not the first person to have survived the shipwreck. Others have found their way to this island, and even though it saved their lives they never said anything. Why is that?"" ""Because when they arrived here the island was full of flowers,"" the child answered. Pedro continued to ask questions until he found out that everyone who arrived on the island were also taken by the flowers, as they had never seen the island nor realized that it was here. He asked why the island was so beautiful, and the child answered that the sun was shining brightly on it and all the flowers were in full bloom. The island was magical and very beautiful. Pedro thought about"," It was a beautiful sunny morning and he decided to go for a walk. 
As he walked he saw several animals that he had read about in books. But they all ran away. He walked deeper into the jungle and still saw no people or animals. All he could hear was the birds singing their songs. He decided to spend the night in the trees. 

Pedro Serrano awoke the next morning to the sounds of birds singing and the sweet smell of flowers. He started to feel more at ease. Still no people or animals. He decided to walk a little further and suddenly he saw a man and a woman on the beach. 
""What is going on?"", asked Pedro Serrano. ""I am happy to see you alive and well"", said the man. ""But where are the people of the ship?"" ""They are all on a beautiful island not too far from here"", he replied. ""I am from the city. I worked on the ship but was fired. So I decided to leave. This island is just for me. Everyone can go back to the city now"". Pedro Serrano and the man went back to the city. Pedro Serrano wrote a letter to the captain of the ship asking for his job back. But noone from the ship ever replied. Pedro Serrano was again left all alone on his island. 

Over time Pedro Serrano met a few people from the city that had also worked on"," He was still alone in this strange new place. He wondered where the sailors from his ship might have ended up. Then Serrano saw something shining in the sun. He walked over to it. It was a treasure chest full of gold coins. Serrano was so amazed by this find that he put the chest in his boat and returned to the island he had first found. 

 Pedro Serrano found the island and returned home rich and satisfied. He put the gold coins into the treasury. Pedro Serrano had found a new home and a rich treasure to call his own.

""Here I was dreaming of the sea and then my ship comes along and... this is where I landed"".

After a long hard swim Pedro Serrano fell onto a beach tired but alive. There was no sign now of his broken ship lost under the waves. He waited for other sailors from the ship to arrive on the island. But no one came. The next morning Serrano looked around the island that saved his life. The birds were laughing at him and pointing to the spot where he fell. Tears came to his eyes. ""Here I was dreaming of the sea and then my ship comes along and... this is where I landed"".

This is a wonderful story about how one's dream can come true. It also shows that sometimes in life, we have to wait a while for the things that we want or hope for, but it is what it is.

The story starts with Pedro Serrano ""sitting on a beach tired and alive."" This is a simile that tells us that Pedro Serrano is ""tired"" but is not ""dead."" This is an unusual simile that seems to reflect how Serrano felt after the ordeal he went through. Serrano feels frustrated that no one came to the island to welcome him and his ship. This indicates that Serrano went through a difficult ordeal"," There was nothing. No tree with an orange fruit to sustain him, no coconut to make copra soup to sustain him. No people. Serrano looked up and saw a group of vultures. 

“Good morning vultures,” Serrano greeted them, pointing at his new surroundings. “This is the first morning I have awoken and found you not just present, but waiting for me.”

“After all these years,” the largest vulture said, “you have still not learned your lesson.”


Serrano looked around and saw nothing but vultures. “I must be a special case.”


“You are right,” the vulture said. “This island seems to have been cursed. All of you are here; none of you could survive.”


“Perhaps it is because you are not a native,” Serrano said, shrugging. “I was just passing through, but now I am glad I came.”


“That’s a shame,” the vulture said. “I remember when this island was famous. There was a tribe of people who made copra here and lived happily. I was one of them.”


“You are not a vulture any more,” Serrano said. “You are a shadow of what you were.”


The vulture nodded. “It is true, I am not what I was.”


“The curse continues,” S"," He saw tracks of prehistoric animals and birds that he did not know existed. He also saw a plant, a tree with roots that made a strong supporting root-system. This plant was not like any he had seen before. It had beautiful orange, yellow and red flowers. The flower of the plant was the reason Serrano survived. Serrano decided to name the plant. He said: Tree of Life. 

The longer a text is, the harder it is for Grade 2 readers to quickly understand the text. To help grade 2 readers quickly understand a text, use the following clues:
1. The number of words is short (the average is 600).
2. The sentence is short (the average is seven words).
3. The number of syllables is high (the average is eleven). 

Short sentences are easier for grade 2 readers to understand. A short sentence has on average 7 words and 7 syllables. A long sentence has more than 12 words and 12 syllables. 
Syllables count for a lot. When a word is spoken the consonant is usually the first syllable and the vowel (the last letter in the word) is the second syllable. For example: cat, cat, ate, ate. 
Shorter sentences contain more words and syllables.

What was Mary doing in the Ruwenzori Mountains? 

She was a student. This was her summer holiday. She was with fifteen other people who were also studying at the university. They went to help make a road through a forest between two big cities.


What city does Mary live in? 
She lives in the city of Oxford.


How old is Mary? 
She is 16 years old.


Why did Mary choose to go to the Ruwenzori Mountains? 
Mary is studying at the University of Oxford. She wants to study forestry. The Ruwenzori Mountains is a part of Africa which is close to London, which is where she lives. She wanted to go on a summer holiday where she could experience something different. She read in a magazine that the Ruwenzori Mountains had an interesting summer holiday option. She decided to look for the option online and she found it on a travel agency website.


Why was the road through a forest so important? 
Mary is helping to build a road in the Ruwenzori Mountains to connect two big cities. Without a road, there is very little traffic and it will be hard to grow the local economy. Mary and her colleagues will receive a bonus for doing this.


How many of Mary's colleagues are from England? 
Five of Mary's colleagues are from England. This is because they all went to the University of Oxford."," The weather was very hot and very humid. 'There was also a lot of jungle to walk through, but there was nothing we could do about that' Mary said. When Mary came back home she did not know what had happend to her holiday. But now she loves Africa, the climate, and her new hobby road construction.

Mary's summer holiday was interesting because she travelled to a foreign country, Africa, and saw some new things. In her summer holiday Mary helped to make a road in Africa and did not get lost or get injured. In her summer holiday Mary learnt about new animals and how to use a can-opener. For her summer holiday Mary got to go to a very nice destination and learned about other countries and their cultures.

Through Mary's summer holiday she learnt about new things and it was very enjoyable for her. Mary also learned a new word in the summer holiday, 'can-opener'. Mary also loved Africa, the climate, and her new hobby road construction. Africa is a very nice place to travel to and when you learn about other countries and their cultures through going on holiday to a foreign country, Africa, it is very enjoyable.

  * When Mary got home from her holiday to England she enjoyed her holiday because she had learned some new things and she had a new hobby too. She loved Africa, the climate, and her new hobby road construction.

Mary learned a word during her summer holiday which is the can-","  She was 16 years old. 'It was horrible, the people were very poor and their clothes were shabby' she said. They had to cut a path with axes. 'It was very dangerous because the axe heads would get lost in the forest and sometimes explode, so you had to be very careful'.  The forest was really dense. There were many snakes and insects, so Mary had to wear goggles. Mary was very happy to be in the mountains. 'We were able to see elephants and lemurs and parrots'.  After two months of hard work, the road was completed. Mary said:  'This holiday has changed my life. I learnt how to work very well and I had so much fun'. Mary Daniels was born in England and is now 18 years old.


The Ruwenzori Mountains and Mary Daniels:  a2a Adventure


The Ruwenzori Mountains, located in Uganda are a mountain range that rises to a height of 3,767 metres.  It is considered a Unesco World Heritage Site and is a popular tourist destination. Its highest point is Mount Pilgrim at 3,767 metres. Mary Daniels went hiking in the Ruwenzori Mountains with fifteen other people. Mary is 16 years old and lives in England. During the hike Mary met two people from her village. They helped her to make a path through a forest in the mountains, in order to build a road between two big"," 'But we made it through and the people in my group even made the film that will be shown in Africa' Mary said proudly. 

The Ruwenzori Mountains in Mary's story were a difficult hill range to hike through for several reasons. One is that there was no drinking water. There wasn't a shop so Mary and her fifteen other colleagues had to get water by dipping twigs in a small stream. They didn't have enough food so they couldn't buy anything in the small town they were in. The language they used to communicate was difficult to understand. Language was the main obstacle Mary had to overcome to complete her summer holiday.


Mary's summer holiday in Africa was difficult to organize and she experienced several difficulties. One of the most difficult issues Mary had to deal with during her summer holiday in the Ruwenzori Mountains was to obtain drinking water. At the beginning of Mary's holiday in Africa she and her friends did not have any water with which to quench their thirst. So they had to resort to taking a few twigs and dipping them in a small stream to quench their thirst. Mary was also unable to purchase any food during her African summer holiday as there was no shop where they could buy provisions.

The language Mary had to deal with in order to communicate with her friends in Africa was very difficult to understand. This language Mary had to communicate in was different from the language she used at school in England. Therefore, she had"," She is a very friendly girl. She always asks us how much longer it is until we get to sleep at night. One evening they came across a campfire and Mary had a very nice swim in a river. 'It was really cool and cold at the same time' she said 'I really enjoyed it'. The next day they had to climb a really big hill and Mary asked them to carry some of her things. She also helped a bit with some of the other girls who were struggling. 'At the beginning I thought I was the weakest one, but now I feel stronger than most of the girls, because I'm young and fit' she said. The next day they had to climb another even bigger hill and Mary helped a lot. 'I think I'm the strongest one in our group now, because my arms are already burning!' she said. When it was evening time she found herself in the hut of a very nice guy, who took her on a very comfortable evening meal. 'It was delicious and full of flavour' she said after the meal. It was very nice and Mary was happy that she had met such a nice guy, but she didn't expect that he would ask her to spend the night with him. 'I'm really glad that he did, because I had never slept outside of a tent before' she said. The next morning Mary woke up with a very heavy feeling in her heart. 'I thought I might die last night, because it was"," After three weeks in the mountains, Mary is still very happy about her summer holiday. The Ruwenzori Mountains are a very nice name for an African mountain range. They are also very big mountains. 'We climbed them, but there was no water, and we had to wait for our guide for three weeks.' The guide Mary was speaking about was a German Shepherd named Tilly. The German Shepherd saved Mary's life one day when she was lost in the forest. 'When we were lost, Tilly was afraid so we could not see where we were going. She led me back to my camp.' Mary is very happy about Tilly, and thinks she is the smartest dog she has ever met. Tilly is very smart because she learned to talk to Mary by listening to Mary speak to herself. 

This summer Mary also read many books from the school library. She particularly enjoyed the book 'Tilly and the Day of the Deer' written by John Burn-Murdoch. The book tells the story of a herding dog who meets a bear who takes the dog for a walk and has lots of fun. The book also tells Mary about the dangers of playing near the edge of a cliff when Tilly was a puppy. Mary thinks that this summer holiday was a very interesting and fun one, and Tilly made her happy. Mary says that the book 'Tilly and the Day of the Deer' is not difficult to understand.

The text is","  

The Ruwenzori Mountains are in the Central African Republic in Africa. They are also known as the Virunga Mountains. They are a very dangerous area to visit. It is not advisable to go there. However, Mary decided to go with the group she was in. She got on the flight that flew to Kiziba, where the road to the Ruwenzori Mountains starts. The flight landed in the village called Bisesero. It took a long time for the bus to get to Bisesero from Kiziba. The road to the Ruwenzori Mountains was very difficult to travel because there was no road.  

They arrived at the Ruwenzori Mountains around 10 o'clock at night. The bus was dropped off by the roadside. Mary took her backpack to a guest house that she read about on the internet. Then the group went to a nearby village to ask if they could sleep in the village hall. It was a bit too dangerous to stay in the village hall because there was a group of very aggressive elephants that came into the village a few days earlier and destroyed all the crops and trees in the village. Luckily, Mary found a small village just outside the forests where she could spend the night.  

The next day they built a small bridge over a river in the forest and started working on the road. It took about a month to make the road through the forest. It was very dangerous to"
" They were riding on fine horses with fine armour and shining swords. 
  Sir Ector's two sons both had a special quality. Sir Kay was the best archer in the army. And young Arthur had an amazing skill in sword fights. 
  Sir Ector's two sons arrived in the town just before the battle. Sir Ector greeted them and the two sons asked if the king would attend. 'No,' he said 'the king is not here. but I hope my two sons can defeat the king's champion.' 
  Sir Kay and young Arthur mounted their horses and rode to the field. As they arrived they saw the king's champion with many knights in front of him. 
  Young Arthur was afraid but Sir Kay thought 'no one will catch me today' so he charged straight at the king's champion. The king's champion blocked Sir Kay's sword thrust, but Sir Kay's arrow pierced his armour. Sir Kay killed the king's champion. 
  Many people surrounded Sir Kay and praised him. Sir Ector was happy. 'My son and Sir Kay fought as if they were equals. My son and Arthur can defeat the king's champion now. We can go home.'


# The new king arrives to the battle

King Roldem rode with his best knights to the battlefield. They saw Sir Ector and his two sons arrive just before the battle started. King Roldem said 'let us start' The king's champions and"," Sir Ector wanted the new king to come so that he will be able to fight together with the best knight in the land. Arthur said to Sir Kay: ""Do you want to fight too?"" Kay said: ""Why not? I want to prove myself a good knight."" Arthur said to Sir Kay: ""Follow me."" Kay said: ""Okay, let's go."" Arthur took his favorite horse from the stables and placed the Archbishop on the Archbishop's horse. Kay climbed on Sir Ector's horse. They both rode toward the battlefield. Arthur saw a beautiful lady on a red horse. He asked Sir Kay: ""Who is that lady on the red horse?"" Sir Kay said: ""That is the lady of the castle, the Lady of the Lake. She has always been a fighter and a good knight."" They rode toward the Lady of the Lake and called to her: ""Lady of the lake, let us fight together."" Lady of the lake smiled and said: ""Come, we shall battle today."" They took their battleaxes and ran toward one another. The archbishop yelled: ""Stop Sir Kay! Stop! I demand that you stop."" Sir Kay paid no attention and kept his course straight toward the enemy. Lady of the lake said to Arthur: ""Stop, Sir Kay! You will kill yourself. Turn back."" Sir Kay did not stop and was hit by Sir Ector's son. Arthur was very angry and shouted: ""Stop that knight, Sir Kay"," They came well armed and ready to fight. There were a lot of people on the roads to the fight and the noise of the horses' hooves and weapons echoed through the valley. When they came near the field, Arthur saw Sir Ector in his white armour with a broad shield. He was mounted on his horse Sir Gryme. Arthur's heart leapt with excitement, he wanted to fight, too. Sir Ector's men told him to wait behind the shield, but Arthur asked 'father why are you waiting? Can't you see that I want to fight? I'm coming with you.' Sir Ector then gave his blessing to the fight. When they all had gathered on the field, the loudest trumpets sounded and everyone charged towards each other. Arthur saw a knight wearing a suit of armour made of golden plates and red dragons. He held his helmet on his head with a golden crest. Sir Ector called to Arthur to attack, but Arthur hesitated and wanted to see the armour first. When the knight was almost upon him, Arthur took off at a run towards the knight and asked him for his armour. But the knight rode away laughing and Arthur never saw him again. Sir Ector and his men then charged forward. The knight attacked Sir Ector with his sword but Sir Ector deflected the blow and the two fought for a long time. Some of Sir Ector's men rode out into the field to pull the knight off Sir Ector. Sir"," The archbishop was riding a small horse and wore a suit of plate mail. He was very strong and powerful.

Fight can be an important aspect of the King Arthur legend. People would get together to fight for sport and glory. This could be for political reasons, but could also be for religious reasons, as people would fight to express their devotion to God and king.

In this story there is mention of many fights. There is mention of a horse, a suit of plate mail, and an Archbishop.

The archbishop is a strong figure and is mentioned several times in the story.

The day of the battle was near and the Archbishop told Sir Ector that they would start the fight at nine o'clock. Then Sir Kay and young Arthur went to the stables to take their horses. 
  
Sir Ector waited for almost half an hour. 'Where is my son? I want to see my son on the field of battle' he asked the messenger. The messenger said: 'Sir Ector you have to be patient. He goes to the stables every day to take care of his horses.' 'Ok' said Sir Ector and waited again. But still Sir Kay did not return. Sir Ector was starting to get angry. Then he saw the Archbishop coming out of his stables and took the path to the stables of Sir Kay. He found the two knights standing together and talking very angrily. They were not using any words but were just trying to get closer to each other. 
  
'Sir Kay!' said Sir Ector. 'What are you doing here?'. Sir Kay did not answer. Sir Ector pushed him and shouted again: 'What are you doing here? Sir Kay, you have to go to the battle. You have to fight for us!'. Sir Kay was still not answering. Then Sir Ector pushed him even harder and Sir Kay fell down to the ground. When he got up he found Sir Arthur, who"," When he saw the strong knights and the best weapons he cried 'Help! Help! We are lost!' Everyone ran towards him and Sir Kay, who was the strongest. Sir Kay fought courageously but he was hit by a sword. 'Oh, my leg!' cried the Archbishop and Sir Ector ran to help him. Sir Kay's leg was badly injured and had to be amputated, but he fought on and killed many knights. Then Sir Kay saw Sir Arthur coming from the forest. 'Courage! Courage! We have defeated the king's men!' he cried. He had a red hat on his head and a sword with a golden handle. Arthur fought well but his spear broke in two and he did not have a helmet. When Sir Kay saw him he cried 'Help!' and he too fought bravely but he was hit by an arrow in the breast and died. Arthur was sad but Sir Kay knew he had won and shouted 'Let's run away to my castle in the forest!' Everyone started running and many knights were killed, and Sir Kay won the day.

'No,' said Sir Kay, 'I would rather stay at home and read a book.' The Archbishop knew that if Sir Kay went to the fight, he would lose his mind for the excitement and would probably even stab people with his great broadsword. So he said to Sir Kay: 'I thought you would go with me to the fight to protect me. But now you will not go.' Then Sir Kay agreed to go to the fight.

In the beginning, Sir Ector was very angry and drove his son Sir Kay away. Then Sir Kay met a young boy on a horse and asked him for a ride. The young boy gave him a carrot as a treat. The carrot was very interesting to Sir Kay. He liked it very much. His favourite horse was also a horse from the fair. He asked the horse, 'Hey, ho, is that horse my favourite?' Then the horse bit Sir Kay and Sir Kay fell off the horse. He hurt himself a lot and his parents brought him to the hospital.

While the young boy was riding his favourite horse, he saw two other horses fighting with sharp hooves and horns. He asked his horse for advice. 'These are good horses', his horse said. The young boy gave the horses some apples as a present"
" He is obsessed with technology and has invested heavily in buying the best internet connection the town has to offer. Frazer, on the other hand, spends his time reading comics and playing video games. Neither of the boys have spoken to the other for months, but at the start of each weekend Frazer is thrilled that Peter will be coming round for a visit. However, as the months pass Frazer can no longer bear the thought of spending another weekend with Peter, as he feels resentful of his friend's obsession with technology. Should Frazer speak to Peter and try to persuade him to switch to a more ""traditional"" hobby?

You can assume that Peter's interest in technology has actually improved the quality of their social life. The boys have been friends since they were very young, and it is natural that Frazer would feel jealous that Peter has acquired the means to socialise more easily. However, Frazer's feeling of envy and resentment is unjustified. It is not fair to Frazer that Peter should have an easier time socialising since he has also invested in technology. The boys could easily swap activities. Frazer could switch his hobby to Peter's obsessions, while Peter could swap his obsession with technology for another hobby that Frazer enjoys.

In such a scenario, it would be unfair to Frazer that he should feel resentful of Peter's new interest in technology. Frazer could still enjoy spending time with Peter, and he should try and talk Peter out"," 

Frazer:  Peter, I've been in your room the last few weekends and I've noticed that you've been working a lot on your laptop. 
Peter: Yeah, I've been working on my laptop because I've been trying to figure out how to make enough money to go to Burning Man. 
Frazer: Is it an art festival?
Peter: No, Burning Man is an art festival, but the money to go is to fund my experimentation with drugs. 
Frazer: Drugs!
Peter: I know, I know, you're probably worried about me, but I promise I'm just trying stuff out to see if I like them.
Frazer: Okay, so you're experimenting with drugs. Is there anything I can do to help?
Peter: Yeah, I need you to stop worrying about me.
Frazer: Okay
Peter: And to Peter's laptop...
Peter opens his laptop and Frazer sees that Peter is working on a website called https://www.burningman.org/, a website that is for sale and you can use Frazer's money to help Frazer help Peter finance his trip to burn man. 
Peter: Hey Frazer, here's a link to a site you can buy my laptop from. This will allow you to afford my trip to Burning Man.
Frazer: What? You're trying to sell me your"," Frazer can't understand why Peter is so fascinated by computers. Peter says he's always wondered why, as an older generation person, he had to use paper and pencil to do his sums and calculations in school. Frazer says he's sure that Peter's obsession with computers will disappear one day and Peter will return to his previous love of fishing and swimming. Frazer is probably right: Peter's obsession with computers will disappear one day and Peter will return to his previous love of fishing and swimming. But until that time, Peter will have to tolerate Frazer's mild jealousy.


The story should focus on Peter and Frazer and include the following elements:

- The characters
- The setting
- The problem
- The solution


The problem
Frazer and Peter grew up in the same small Canadian town but they have always enjoyed different hobbies: Frazer prefers swimming to fishing and his friends do not have an interest in computers. Peter, on the other hand, is obsessed with computers and spends his spare time designing programs. This has upset Frazer because he thinks Peter's interest in computers will not last.


The solution
As time passes, Peter will come to see that he was right to be excited by computers. Because computers are actually quite old and have evolved over many years, they are easier to understand than Frazer believes. They also make life easier in modern times, enabling us to do things that were not possible when they first appeared"," It seems he is able to program very advanced computers that can do things Frazer has only read about on the internet. The friends decide to find out exactly what Peter can do and ask him to show them. To find out they need to write a story about it and to do that they decide to interview Peter.

To find out what Peter can do Frazer and Peter ask Peter to show them what he has been working on on his laptop.  Peter has programmed a very advanced computer that can do things Frazer has only read about on the internet.

Peter explains what the computer can do including playing chess, navigating the galaxy, and repairing broken stars.  While Peter's laptop is a very impressive piece of technology, he says he had a difficult time programming it.  After many hours of trial and error and much frustration he was unable to program the computer.

Frazer is quite impressed by Peter's ability to program such a sophisticated computer, and offers to hire Peter to help him program his own laptop.


Frazer and Peter then decide to write a story about what Peter can do based on their conversation. Frazer begins his story by saying, ""The friends decide to find out exactly what Peter can do and ask him to show them."" 

Next Frazer explains that they had decided to interview Peter because they wanted to find out what he could do. 

Frazer goes on to describe the two friends spending every weekend in Peter"," They have spent hours building websites and programs, learning how to program code and creating 3D graphics and computer animation. In fact, during one weekend they created an animated short film which they are now selling on YouTube to make money. Frazer and Peter have been inspired by the amazing projects and programs they have created and believe they have found their passion in programming and computer coding. Frazer has asked Peter if he would be willing to teach him how to code. And Peter has gladly accepted. 

Which of the following statements is false or questionable with respect to the story above? 

- Frazer and Peter did not grow up in the same small Canadian town.
- Frazer and Peter have only been friends for the last few months.
- Peter does not enjoy going fishing or swimming.
- Peter and Frazer have not created any animated short films.
- Frazer did not ask Peter if he would be willing to teach him how to code.

  The statement that is questionable is the last one: Frazer did not ask Peter if he would be willing to teach him how to code. The story clearly shows that Peter has willingly accepted to teach Frazer how to code.

  With these statements in mind we can answer the original prompt. The statement that is false is the one stating that Frazer and Peter did not grow up in the same small Canadian town: Frazer and Peter indeed did grow up in the same small Canadian town. The other statements are"," Frazer finds this a little strange as Peter has always been a bookworm. But he decides not to question him about the computer project and instead continues to spend time with him.

Peter confides in Frazer that he and some of his friends have been working on a computer program that can predict with 95% accuracy whether a particular person has had a heart attack or not, and he is so excited about this achievement. Frazer is surprised to hear this as Peter had been a bookworm all his life, and didn't have any interests that might have led to him finding time to spend on a computer.

Frazer becomes even more surprised when Peter reveals he has been working on the computer program for the last 10 years and has spent up to 10 hours a day on it since he was 14. Frazer isn't sure how Peter has been able to devote so much time to the project without noticing, but does his best to not embarrass him in front of his friends by suggesting he may be developing an addiction to his computer.

Peter explains that his computer addiction has been a difficult one to break, since he doesn't really have any other interests or hobbies that he can spend his time on. He's always felt guilty that he is wasting so much time on a computer, since he believes he could be spending that time working on his computer program that could save so many lives. But his guilt has prevented him from cutting down his computer use, even though"," Frazer is interested in technology but Peter is always trying to show Frazer how amazing he is with technology. One weekend Peter had the brilliant idea of creating a website where anyone who searches for a keyword will be sent to a video of a racehorse running. Frazer doesn't ride horses so wasn't interested. Peter had no idea how much Frazer hated horses so Peter asked a friend to watch the horse video and send it to Peter via email. Peter started to panic, he was getting hate-mails from people who were searching for horses and Peter realised that he had to sort this website out right away. Peter started searching the internet for keywords that could relate to horses and after a few hours he found the answer - it's called ""spring training"". The next day at school Peter told Frazer about his website and Frazer was surprised to learn that Peter had actually created the website himself after spending all weekend on it. Peter's website has now been removed as Peter realised that Frazer would never go to Peter's room to watch a horse video. Frazer is now assessing A2 level text as he does not like websites and does not understand how Peter created the website and Frazer does not ride horses.


Text assessed as A1 level: The two boys have been friends since they were little. They love to spend their weekends in each other's company, going to the river or to friends' houses. They have even spent their summers together. Recently, though, Peter"
" 'He told me about a war a long time ago in his country,' Clayton started. 'He said that when the government found out the people didn't like the war, they sent soldiers to make the people kill each other. They would come into your house at night and shoot the family who was sleeping. They said it was for a war and they had to do it. I couldn't help myself because I started to cry.' Clayton's mother came into the room. 'Son, what's wrong?' Clayton didn't want to tell her what he had seen. So he said something like, 'Mother, a ghost is in the bedroom and he is telling me stories about his country. He was in a war and the government sent soldiers to shoot his family because they didn't like it.' Clayton's mother was very sad for a while then she decided to look into it. She spoke with Clayton's friend. Clayton's friend went to the government and they said Clayton was mistaken. He didn't see anything. But Clayton believes he still sees the soldiers on the roof. He said that after the government officials left the house they still shot at him from the roof. Clayton believes they didn't see or hear him. So he starts to practice hiding in places in the house that have nooks or corners where he thinks the soldiers won't see him.' Wish was very interested. 'What did the ghost say about his country?' asked Wish. 'He said the soldiers who were trying to kill"," He told us of his friend Joe and how Joe used to talk to people who had died, and tell them things before Joe died himself. I didn't know that Joe died but that's why he would talk to his friends who had died who passed over, to tell them things before they did. 'That sounds familiar', I said, thinking of Joe. 'I thought so too', said Clayton, 'That's why I know who you are, you look like Joe'. Sanderson and I looked at each other and realised that Clayton had been telling us the same story all along. As Clayton had died of kidney failure aged 10 from aplastic anaemia in April 2017, we suspected he may have been describing the symptoms to us because he was trying to convince us that Joe used to talk to him and that is why he looks like Joe. I'm so sorry Clayton, we know that you tried to be convincing. You were a talented storyteller.'

As a child my friend Clayton loved telling stories. We would listen to him at night while he was babysitting me. He told us scary stories about goblins, witches and zombies. One night when Clayton was babysitting me, I woke up in the middle of the night to find a shadowy figure standing next to my bed. I lay there wide awake, sweating, my heart pounding. A voice called out from across the room, 'Is anyone there?' and I wondered if it was Clayton"," We were sad when he had to leave at midnight but Clayton had promised us more ghost stories at 7 o'clock. We started to undress in our bedroom, wishing to get rid of the last remains of fog. Clayton was laughing quietly, 'Don't worry, it's all for the best'... When he was gone, we started to understand what had happened. Our friend had made love to his wife after a long time and she had suddenly passed away after a heart attack. We were so worried, but Clayton explained us that she hadn't suffered. The ghost story was true' (Sanderson and Wish, 9 years old, from Portugal).

This example clearly shows that Clayton's storytelling skill had an impact on both the A2 readers, Wish and Sanderson, and also on the 9-year-old Portuguese girl who was present during the story-telling. She even reported to have experienced emotions such as sadness and worry. The way that Clayton made the story interesting to her using his storytelling skills made her follow along and understand what had happened.

In summary, the 9-year-old Portuguese girl was able to develop her understanding and interpretation of an important event in her life based on Clayton's storytelling skills.

## Summary

According to A2, Sanderson and Wish, the following are some of the skills Clayton displays:

  * Storytelling (using body language, gestures, facial expressions, voice tone, eye contact, pause before talking"," 'I wish Clayton had seen more of the ghost. I really wish he had seen more of the ghost,' said Sanderson.

The text provides a list of potential story ideas. The prompt was designed to encourage students to write a short story about their friend's experiences after the arrival of the ghost.

Story ideas:

  1. Our friend asked us to leave so that he could be alone with his latest girlfriend. 
  2. Our friend started feeling sick. He didn't want his parents to know so he asked us to tell them he'd called it a night. 
  3. Our friend was busy writing a new song when his bandmate suggested they should try a cover of a popular track. 
  4. Our friend had a big audition coming up for a part on a soap opera. He was so excited! Unfortunately, his audition was cancelled so he was worried about his chances of getting the part. 
  5. Our friend loves the outdoors and was on his way to a hike when he was stopped by the police. He was told to find a driver who was heading in the right direction and he'd be arrested for drunk driving. 
  6. Our friend is obsessed with horror movies and asked us to come watch a scary film with him. 
  7. Our friend started feeling lonely at our house, so we offered to let him come over and play video games. He was glad to have us as company. 
  8."," He was a good storyteller and had travelled the world. We were starting to feel really creeped out when he started to laugh and said he could make his stories go 'bump' in the middle when we weren't listening. We soon realized that the more we laughed, the more scary Clayton became. He was making all these noise like a man in love, saying things like 'I'm going to take this big stone and...', 'Wait till you hear this!', 'You just have to listen closely!', '...and then we can jump on the moon and fly together!'. The more we laughed, the more Clayton told funny stories. We got really scared when he started to laugh at a really scary part and make these 'bumpy' noises and we started to feel really creeped out. When we asked Clayton if he was all right, he said 'It just reminded me of a story my father used to tell me about a time in World War II where our village was attacked and all the men were taken prisoner and we had to flee on a small boat. As we left, I noticed an oily slick on the bottom of the boat and when I asked my father about it, he explained that at that time, they had used whale oil for lighting, but that the Germans had discovered the oily slick and sunk every boat we came across. I had to get off the boat and swim to a floating tree and climb up to safety - it was"," It was very exciting for us to have a ghost in our house. We had heard stories about ghosts but to see one was very surprising.'

It was a good ending and Clayton was going to find his wife. 'Did he tell you his name?' I asked Clayton. He replied that the ghost did not have a name but he thought he had heard him say his name a few times. We asked for clarification, but the ghost had moved on the minute. 'He said his name was Dr Griffiths, but I'm not sure.' We were disappointed. We had high expectations from Clayton. 'Was his appearance normal?' I asked. He seemed kind of pale and a bit shaky. 'No, it was as if the light was hurting his eyes.' That was odd. We were going to call the police. Maybe he was going blind and needed glasses? Clayton refused to tell us more. He said it was not important. We called the police and Clayton was placed under house arrest.

There are two main kinds of crocodiles we can mention. The first ones are Nile crocodiles. They have long bodies and a very long neck. The head is flat which makes them look very scary. They live in the rivers in Central and Southern Africa. 

The other one is the saltwater crocodile. They have shorter legs and a longer neck than the Nile crocodiles. They live in Central America and Northern Australia. They look a bit like a snake. The saltwater crocodiles will swim across rivers to hunt and catch birds and small animals. 

We also have other kinds of crocodiles for example the Gourami Crocodile. They have small bodies and small legs and feet. They live in fresh water in parts of Asia.

  

We can find crocodiles in tropical parts of the world for example Africa South America and Northern Australia. They spend most of the time in slow-moving water but they can move fast through the water and on land. You often see crocodiles together in large groups. They eat everything they catch like fish birds and small animals. Crocodiles do not have arms or legs.

Jonathan’s reaction to his letter:

This is so interesting! Jonathan is a boy from our class, I’m Maria. I’m glad he misses England but it’s sad that he will go back again next time but he is leaving the city he is in, right? He is being more considerate of his visit by thinking about our classmates and staying in the city where I am from, which is a good thing. I like him!

The reaction to Jonathan’s letter on Maria’s part:

That is a very kind letter, I hope Jonathan comes back again soon! I’ll miss him when he is gone.

Jonathan’s reaction to Maria’s reaction:

Awww that’s very sweet of Maria. I hope he comes back! Maybe next time we should stay in the same city? That would be neat.

Maria’s reaction to the reaction:

That would be nice! He is such a considerate boy! 

Maria’s letter to Jonathan:

Maria – Maria is a character in the book ‘Wuthering Heights’ written by Emily Brontë. The book tells the story of the forbidden love between Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine is a young girl who lives alone in a house in the English countryside with no family or friends. Maria is a classmate of Catherine’s and she strongly believes that Catherine is the most beautiful woman in the world. They shared an instant connection and Maria spent the majority of the book showing Catherine how pretty and beautiful she was. In the end, Heathcliff comes into their lives and they fall in love.

At the beginning of the story, Maria is unaware that David is still alive. She does not hear about David’s return from England until the end of the book when the novel ends. When the author includes the information that Maria has never heard about David, it leaves the reader with the feeling that Maria does not know about David’s return and this impacts how she views Catherine. David left Maria in England because he felt that he did not have a good enough relationship with Maria to stay in the country. This raises the question of whether Maria even knows that David is alive. 

David, the character who leaves Maria in England, has now returned home and Maria is a character in the novel ‘Wuthering Heights’ who was in Catherine’s life. When David leaves Maria, he feels that"," With love, your English teacher, Maria.


Maria is an English teacher who is sad that she will not get to return to England due to the short time she had been in that country. She thinks of all the friends she made while teaching in the country and cries when she leaves. Maria wishes she could stay in England longer but knows that it’s not possible because there is only a limited time she could stay in different cities.


Maria’s sadness when she leaves England is similar to the sadness experienced when we leave our country or city. While it’s not pleasant to leave our native or adopted place of residence, it’s natural to feel sad that we have to leave our country of residence. This is because we care a lot about the people we care about and who care about us, and we wish we could stay and care for them. Similarly, Maria is sad that she has to leave England and her friends but realizes it is what is meant to be and that she must move on. She can now make good friends in her new city and remember England by visiting her friends there.


Maria’s English teacher would understand her sadness when she leaves England. English teachers are known to care a lot about their students and wish the students good fortune when they leave. English teachers will likely share their own sadness with their students when they leave, and Maria’s English teacher, Maria, would definitely share this piece of news with Maria.


Maria’"," With love, my English teacher. 

From this prompt, the reader should be able to identify a theme of visiting other countries, making friends from different cultures, and crying when leaving a loved one. The final passage should include all three of these ideas.


Dear Maria, it’s great to hear you miss England and your teacher. I bet you will visit England again and make many friends from there. Now that we are back in my country I feel very homesick, but it will pass. Love, your teacher.


A passage that captures the theme of making friends from different cultures is:

Maria, I cried when I left England because my visit was too short. Next time I will stay in a different city.


The reader can tell this passage is written by an English teacher because it is written in the first person and Maria is named. Maria also mentioned she cried when she left England, which is another theme mentioned in the prompt. The last sentence of the passage suggests Maria will visit England again and make many friends from there, two ideas mentioned in the prompt.


Maria is mentioned in the first person because the teacher wrote the passage. Maria is also named in the passage, which is a signature technique used by ESL teachers to make the text clear and memorable to their students.

" Obama Sr. had returned to Kenya for the funeral and was with him when he received the call that changed his life. 

Obama Sr. was a lawyer and community leader in Chicago. He was married to a Kenyan woman who was also a nurse. She had adopted three children from a previous relationship-two daughters and a son. 

One year later Obama II was born. Three years after that Obama III followed. Obama and his family spent much of their time in Nairobi where Obama Sr's in-laws lived. Obama Sr. made a new will leaving most of his estate to his daughters. But his son, Obama II, and grandson, Obama III, were not included in the document. Obama Sr. wanted to leave his entire estate to Obama III but the document was not signed until nine months later. 

After the funeral Obama Jr. began to get his schooling in Nairobi. He lived with his aunt and his Kenyan mother-in-law and worked for a time as a waitress. But Obama II and III were growing up fast and by the time Obama Jr. finished high school, his children were all in their late teens and early twenties. Obama Jr. wanted to provide for his children and went to get a law degree. His studies and subsequent legal practice were to take him back and forth between Nairobi and Chicago where he and his children lived. He married a Kenyan woman and fathered five more children. The children"," 
  
Obama Sr was the second of his parents' five children. He had an easy-going, optimistic personality and could be quite funny. He married Michelle Robinson and had two sons, Barack Obama, Jr. and Michelle Obama. He worked as a community organizer in Chicago and went on to law school but never practiced law. He campaigned for John Kerry in 2004 and then in 2008 Hillary Clinton in the United States presidential election. He was a member of the Democratic National Committee for several years until the 2016 elections.

What was Barack Obama's relationship with his father like? 
Barack Obama and his father, Obama Senior, were very close. They worked hard to provide for their family. Obama Sr. encouraged his son to keep an open mind and to always work hard to improve himself. Obama Senior taught Barack Obama to read at a young age and also encouraged him to join sports teams. The two often got into heated arguments, but always resolved them. Obama Senior was a strong, independent man who rarely showed his emotion.

Obama Senior and his wife had five children: two sons and three daughters. There were often hard times as a family because of the challenges of starting a new farm in rural Kenya. The Obama family faced many tests, but they also faced great happiness because of the love they shared. 
  
Obama Senior often told his son, ""You can't save the world all by yourself."" He strongly encouraged his son to continue his education and","

Obama was stunned by the news but it was his Aunt that had made the call.  His Aunt had gone to Kenya on a holiday and now lived in a small village called Nyang'oma Kogelo. He made a vow to return to Africa to visit his family. 
He returned a decade later and discovered that his Aunt had been widowed twice over. Her once prosperous farm was now owned by one of the warlords who had ravaged the country during the  '80s Somalia conflict. She no longer had any money and lived in fear of her life. Obama returned to Nairobi to once again find work but without his wife Michelle he felt alone and lost. 
He decided to take matters into his own hands.

Obama took out a loan from a local bank. The loan was secured on the family farm so he could return to work it and regain his former self. 
In his will he made it clear that the farm should go to a relative of his wife, her sister.  His Uncle Tawana.  He had met and liked Tawana while they were students in America and he knew she would take care of the farm and ensure its ongoing success.

On the way to the farm, Obama stopped at a church in a neighbouring village. He knocked on the church door, hoping he could be saved, to no one in particular he heard this voice; ""Come in brother"".  He entered the church","

#  Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
Flesch reading-level algorithm (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level) is a measurement of the difficulty of words and sentences to non-readers. A rating of 1 is generally considered to be easy to read, while a rating of 9 is considered to be very difficult to read. This algorithm is based on the assumption that words with a difficult to pronounce or unpronounceable character in them are interpreted slower by the brain than words with easy-to-pronounce characters. 

The Grade Level algorithm is considered a reliable and valid measure of difficulty, although the measure does not take into account the actual age of the reader or the education level. 

This is an example of a story using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level algorithm in the prompt:

While the story is told from a first person point of view, the main character is a male, the story takes place in England, and it does not mention cannibalism.  While this could make a story suitable for 11 to 18 year olds, the use of guns could also appeal to a much younger audience.  They could be interested in stories about people defending themselves or others.

In terms of plot, the story takes place in England in the 19th Century. The main character moves some of his personal possessions into a larger cave in order to have access to firearms when he is at his country home.  As with most literary devices, there is a secondary plot in the main character must also kill 500 cannibals who are on a killing spree.  At one point the main character takes his wife along with his son and daughter to the cave in order to look at the guns.  In other words the story could be viewed as a light-hearted adventure.

The use of language is typical of the time period with the main character speaking in past tense.  He is also a bit eccentric with his view on cannibalism.  Finally the story can be interpreted as having some racial undertones with the main character having access to firearms that were only available to Englishmen at the time.

A story about guns and violence
One night I was hungry, so I went to a cave where there was food. It was a really nice cave, with big tables and a big fireplace. I ate, then lay down on the couch in front of the fire to warm up. While I was doing that, I noticed a pile of things on the floor that looked like they might be guns. I walked over to get a better look, and realized they were actual guns!  

They were all broken, but I picked one up and examined it. It had a broken part on the bottom, and I wondered if it was from a helicopter crash.  

So I began to fix the gun, cleaning out the barrel and trying to tighten the bolt. As I worked on it, it got warmer, and I began to feel sleepy. So I decided to try it out. When I turned it on, it made this loud noise, but it worked!

I was very happy, and I decided to leave the gun where it was so that the owner would see me work on it. He was very surprised to see me there, and he asked who I was. I said I was the new owner, and he was very happy to see me. He offered me some tea, but","Write a story that is readable by A2 learners in the CEFR scale using the following prompt.

The old man in red has tried to explain his way of life to each one of them, the night passes quickly and each child wishes they could join the others at the presents but they are all afraid of losing their place in line.

Your response should include specific strategies to help readers enjoy a healthy life, including a section on tips for staying healthy and active.

A healthy life is not defined by an impossible standard of sleeping for ten hours and going to sleep after 9 pm. What is healthy for one person is not healthy for another. What is healthy for a person with depression may not be healthy for a person who has never experienced depression. What is healthy for a young girl growing up in Ireland may not be healthy for a young woman growing up in California. Different people have different needs and preferences. 

A healthy life is about maximizing one's potential and living life to the fullest. It is about pursuing one's goals, taking risks, investing in one's education, developing meaningful relationships and doing what one enjoys. What is healthy for one person may not be healthy for another. What is healthy for one group of people may not be healthy for another group of people. Everyone's experience may vary. But what is healthy cannot be determined by measuring it against an impossible standard, so don't try.

Here are some strategies you can use to help readers enjoy a healthy life:
- Take time to relax"," I spend every weekend practising and when I have a tournament it's the most important thing in my life. I try to go to the gym, that is also very important, because my body needs to be in good shape. I also eat very healthily.

" Because of this the men decided to stand together and talk to their neighbors and protect the city at night. They decided to ask the King for permission to use guns to do this. The King refused but the city needed protecting and so they persuaded the Parliament to give them permission to use guns. These guns were made from blackpowder and they were very difficult to make and often the guns went off by themselves or went wrong. Sometimes the gunmen would run out of gunpowder and so they used to throw their guns into the Thames. 

Over the next few centuries the city grew and so did the police force. They got a lot of new guns made from blackpowder and they were very good at protecting the city. After many years of hard work and with the help of the new guns, the London police protected the city even better and more efficiently than ever.


The London Police were started by the British Royal Family after the English Civil War in 1642. They were called London Watch and were responsible for protecting the City of London. The Watch consisted of a group of old men called Bow Street Runners. Because of their protection, they were not paid very much but over time this changed and they became very rich. Over time they grew to protect the City of London and the people of England. The London Police protected the city very well during the Industrial Revolution.


As the city grew and the people became richer, they wanted the protection of the London Police even more"," In 1829 a group of activists thought that London needed a police force to protect the city. They gathered some of the old men and they began to train them for the job. They didn't have any money to pay them so they used to make a list of the men who agreed to help. The list was called ""roll of honour"". That was the start of the London police force. 

Why did the London police need a ""roll of honour""?  

The police needed a list of the old men because they needed to pay the men for their training. The police needed the list because they didn't have enough money to pay all the men. The police needed the list to keep a record of the men who agreed to help. The police needed a list to know who to thank when the police did  good jobs. 

The police trained the old men and the police thanked the men. After a while, the police were starting to do good jobs. The London police were able to catch a few bad guys and the police were able to make the city cleaner. The London police became so good that other cities in the world started to hire the London police force. That is why today there are policemen everywhere in London but not many years ago there were no policemen at all.


THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE  


300 years ago, in 1829, a group of activists thought that London needed a police force to protect"," So they needed someone to protect them against robbers and muggers. So the wealthy decided to pay one policeman to help them.  In 1789 they passed a law that each household should have one policeman. In 1829 the number of policemen was doubled and they were paid a lot more. Today the London police have over 3000 members and they are protecting the city and catching the robbers and muggers.


-   A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much.
-   In 1789 they passed a law that each household should have one policeman.
-   In 1829 the number of policemen was doubled and they were paid a lot more.


The London police became a thing because of an act passed in 1789. This act made it compulsory for each household to have one policeman. This act was passed because there were many people living in the city who were poor and needed someone to protect them from robbers and muggers. This act was passed because in 1789 when the act was passed there were fewer people living in London than there are today. Today the London police have over 3000 members and they are protecting the city and catching the robbers and muggers.


-   In 1789 when the act was passed there were fewer people living in London than there are today.
-   In 1829 the number of policemen was doubled and they were paid a lot more."," In the year 1667 there was a fire on the north bank of the river in the City of London. It was so big that fire engines couldn’t get to the scene. The fire spread to four warehouses and quickly got out of control. 

Some men took a boat across the river to put the fire out but it was too late. Many people died and the city was ruined. Most of the city streets were in flames and the Fire Marshals could not reach the city.

That’s when some wealthy businessmen from the South of the city brought in a few policemen and paid them to protect the city.


The London Police started in 1614. It was formed by Sir Thomas Gresham who lived in the city. It was not a very large organisation back then, but it grew quickly after the French Revolution where it helped to put down many rebellions. The London Police helped to make the London streets safer and helped build many city squares.


In the year 1700 there were only 300 policemen in London, but that number increased rapidly after that. London had many poor people, and there was fighting between the rich and poor. The London Police helped to make the city safer and gave people hope that they could get ahead in life.


Today there are policemen everywhere in the city of London. They help protect the city and keep it safe.


Please provide a readable story that includes the following details:

"," In 1858, in the year of Queen Victoria's coronation, there lived two children in London who were very poor. Their mother worked as a shop-stewardess and their father sold newspapers. They had only one set of clothes each year so that they could not be poor for another year. The children decided to run away and ask the old policemen for help. The children had to pass very many soldiers guards and other policemen. They did not know what danger was because they had never been in such a situation before. But the children managed to get through the guards and they found an old policeman on the street. The policeman knew about the children and came with them to their house and helped them to get money so that they could go to a bigger city. From then on, the children could go to a bigger city and they would find a shop or an employment where they could earn some money so that their family could eat once a day. This is how London got with policemen.  

The prompt is not wrong, although I would have phrased it slightly differently:

In 1700, London had no policemen, but in 1858 the children of two poor people living in the city managed to get two policemen to help them. 

A2 learners can understand the prompt but they may have difficulties understanding the historical context, so it might help to provide additional context with additional information:

The history of London is very interesting. It"," At first they decided that they would protect the poor by organizing a group of poor men to go around the city at night and watch the streets. These were known as Bow Street Runners. These men wore special clothes so that the police would not notice them until it was too late. When the Bow Street runners saw anything amiss they would go to the police station and ask the policemen to arrest the people who were breaking the law. This worked well for about 150 years but then the police started to arrest the Bow Street runners and this made the people even poorer because the Bow Street runners were not paid very much either. This led to another kind of man called a policeman coming into being. Now almost every street in London has at least one policeman and sometimes more than one.

He asked the mayor, who was Lord Mayor at the time for permission to paint a better picture of London. The mayor did not want anything better, he was only concerned that the city streets were not clean. So Lord Mayor stopped the painters and a battle started. Hogarth painted the Battle of Plomley Bridge. This painting shocked the government that was afraid of what people would do if they see the bad picture of London. In 1747 the government ordered painters to clean the city streets. One year later the government ordered to hire more policemen. The number of policemen in London increased by more than 1000 in 1750. Now more than 70 years later in 2023 there are almost 800 policemen in London, which is because the government still orders to have more policemen.

" ""Where?"" Mary asked. ""I just saw something out there"" Elliott answered. ""Is it a friend or a foe?"" Mary asked. ""I don't know"" Elliott answered. Mary called Elliott's names but he only heard her faintly. She ran through the house searching for him. She could see him through a window on the third floor and could see he was talking to the orange. ""Elliott"" Mary called. ""I'm coming"" he yelled and she saw him wave to the orange. Mary was very happy to see her son safe. They went back into the living room. Tyler was playing with his toys and his mom asked him a question. Tyler stopped playing and looked up at Mary with a big smile. ""Did you see Elliott?"" Mary asked her son. ""He was talking to something orange."" ""What did he say?"" Mary asked. ""He said, 'I'm coming', and then he waved at the orange."" ""Well done Elliott"" Elliott's father said. Elliott's smile grew even wider.

What kind of ""orange"" is this? It's an orange! A fruit! But not just any fruit, it's an orange from the east of the sun. These orange trees are rare. Most children don't see these orange trees. However, Elliott is a very curious boy, and has a powerful sense of smell. It's this that led him to find the orange tree. Elliott's friend Tyler didn't see the"," Mary looked off into the yard and then into the sky. She saw it too! A bright blue light that was orange in the middle, and then it flew away. ""It was a UFO, I believe"" Mary said to her son. Elliot did not believe her, ""It wasn't a UFO mom, it was a plane"" he said. Mary looked at her son and then got a flashlight and held it up to the sky. The light from the flashlight was shining into Elliott's eyes, and then he saw it too! A bright blue plane that was orange in the middle, and then it flew away! The children were in complete shock! Their moms did not know what to think! ""It wasn't a plane, it was a UFO"" Elliot said. Mary held her son and they were both in complete shock!

Mary had a sandwich and a drink for them and then they went to bed. Mary woke up Elliott and Tyler at 6 am. ""Time to get up!"" she said. The boys got up and got dressed. ""Did you see anything?"" Tyler asked. ""Nope,"" Elliott said. Mary said she was going to the store for coffee and bread. She said she'd be back in 5 minutes. ""Ok,"" said Elliott. Mary came back with the things the boys needed. ""I saw something orange over there on the corner."" Tyler pointed to a house across the street. Mary got in her car and drove over to the house. ""There is no one in the house,"" a man said. Mary said she would wait out front. The man went into the house. Mary said, ""Is there anything that you want me to get for you?""

Tyler turned bright red and started to cry.

Mary looked at Elliott. ""Do you want to go and play with Tyler?"" She asked. Elliott nodded. Mary put on her coat and took Elliott to Tyler's house. While they were walking, Tyler said, ""Elliott, did you see that orange flying in the sky?"" ""Yes"" said Elliott. Tyler's mom opened the door and hugged Elliott. Elliott went into the kitchen to talk to Tyler's mom. After a few minutes, Mary and Elliott came back. ""So, what do you think Tyler saw?"" Mary asked. ""Tyler said he saw a man on the roof."" Elliott said. Mary nodded. Elliott's mom called Elliott to take a plate to the table. After they had eaten, they went outside and Elliott pointed to a tree in the yard. ""That is a ladder!"" Elliott said. Tyler took a closer look. The ladder was leaning against the tree. Tyler climbed the ladder and Elliott watched him from the ground. Tyler yelled, ""Elliott! It's"," Tyler said, ""Let's get my camera!""  Tyler ran inside the house, got his camera and they all went outside. Elliott took a deep breath. ""It looks like a big bus!"" Tyler said. Elliott focused on the orange shape moving quickly across the yard. Elliott took his aim and fired. ""BOOM!"" Elliott exclaimed. Mary and Elliott's mom laughed and cried and Tyler was so happy. ""Ok kids I'm going to take this outside"" Mary said. She closed the door and Mary and Elliott's mom talked to Tyler and his brothers about the new orange monster.  
Tyler returned with his story. The orange shape was a bus, and Mary and Elliott's mom are his parents.

" Then he noticed a boy about his age sitting by the river with a boat. 'I wonder if the boy would give me a push in the boat.' Nunez tried to talk to the boy but the boy was busy with his work and didn't notice him. So Nunez waited for a while and then suddenly the boy looked up from his work and said 'Are you OK?', and then his brother came and the boy gave him a push in the boat. 'Ah, that was nice of you', said Nunez. 'I'm not allowed to take anyone in the boat', replied the boy.

'But why?', Nunez asked. The boy replied: 'My father doesn't like it. He said it's against the rules.' Nunez started to get angry, 'Why don't you do something about your father?', he asked angrily. The boy looked at him with pity. 'My father works hard to support us and it would be unfair for him to stop now. And it's not like my brother would listen to me anyway, he always wants what I want. And anyway I love the water and I wouldn't want to be on the river without you.' Nunez saw sense in what the boy said and they walked back to the village side by side.

The boy, let's call him Luis, was right. Nunez should have tried to talk to his father, but instead of doing that"," He sat down on a rock. He felt very warm in his suit. 
  
Nunez opened his suit and looked at his arms and legs. He had a cut on his leg from where he had stepped on a stone. He looked at the flowers and thought how pretty they were. He noticed a fly landing on his face. 'How annoying' Nunez thought. He started to take off his suit and looked at himself in the river. 

Nunez decided to change into dry clothes to go home. When he got to his house he saw his friend dancing by the river. He shouted at him 'Come and dance with me' Nunez thought. His friend agreed. They danced and talked until it got dark. Nunez noticed his friend had been drinking and was very talkative. He had a few too many drinks. 

When it got dark Nunez's friend woke him up at midnight. Nunez went downstairs and saw his friend was crying. His friend explained that he was drunk and didn't know what he had done. He asked if Nunez would forgive him. 'Of course' Nunez replied. He held him and made him tell him all of what had happened. 

After a few minutes Nunez's friend realised he was talking to a robot and tried to run away. Nunez chased him and caught him. His friend started hitting Nunez with a stick until he ran out"," The next morning he was so excited to find a gold nugget. He went home and proudly showed his newfound treasure to his family. His wife saw the nugget and she said 'No gold nugget...it is only a dream'.  


Nunez's wife tries to tell him that they need to go back to sleep, but Nunez is excited and he doesn't hear her.  When Nunez woke up in the morning, he was surprised to find his wife was not there.  She had already gone to work. Nunez thinks about what his wife said the night before and he thinks about the dream he had.  He notices there is a tree with beautiful flowers just like in his dream. He goes to look at the tree but it is already dead. This is when Nunez remembers he was dreaming and starts to panic.  His family was very sad because they did not know what happened to him.


Nunez's story is very similar to the story of a man from California named Peter Kline.  Both men had severe head injuries and were in a vegetative state for a long time.  The similarities between the two stories are very interesting.  Both men were living in the wild and were unable to communicate for a long time.  They both had a strong will to survive and were very independent.  When Nunez had his dream, he was so excited that he left to find"," 'I wonder if anyone is here' he thought. 

The passage is difficult to understand because of the long list of words used in the sentence. The main idea is that Nunez thought ""this is a lovely place"" when he reached the river but when he started walking again he fell again.

After finishing his drink, Nunez started walking towards the village. He was very tired now and it was difficult to keep following the path. He saw a well and he decided to rest there for a moment. 

After resting for a short time, Nunez started walking again. But now it was much harder to keep following the path, because he didn't see any flowers anymore. He thought to himself: 'I don't feel like I'm in a beautiful place anymore.' 

Suddenly, he heard a water buffalo bray near him. It was such a lovely sound, that he started laughing to himself. 'Of course! This is a beautiful place after all. There is a water buffalo here!' 

Nunez started smiling again and started following the path again. 

By the time he reached the village, Nunez felt so much better. He was feeling happier and happier as the evening approached. 

Nunez had a pleasant evening. It seemed that he had found the beautiful place again. He decided to stay the night in the village and to go for a walk in the morning. 

The next morning Nunez felt even better and he went for a walk around the village. It was so nice to walk again, that he decided to stay in the village and spend his day reading and relaxing. 

The day had passed so pleasantly that Nunez decided to stay in the village longer."," That night he could not sleep because he was too tired. He knew it was going to be a difficult day tomorrow.

"," He continued his journey back to the village. It was still difficult because the path was steep and the ground was rough. He reached the village around six o'clock and he decided to have some dinner.  

Note: A2 level stories should have at least three features listed below:  
1. Use simple sentences and patterns.  
2. Use explicit information.  
3. Use limited number of information points.  

The story provided by @user140788 above uses features to meet the A2 level requirement. It uses simple sentences and sentences pattern which indicates that the text assessed as A2 level. Additionally, the text has explicit information like ""He went carefully because he didn't want to fall again"". Moreover, the text has limited number of information points. It has only three information points to show the process of Nunez reaching the river and finishing his journey back to the village. 
Generally, texts assessed as A1 level are written at the end of the CEFR scale using a different grading pattern using 'and' instead of 'but'. For example, the grading pattern provided below ""and then he saw the river"" indicates that the text has used explicit information and uses basic sentence patterns.
Texts assessed as A2 level should have features 1,2,3.


Texts assessed as A1 level generally don't follow all the requirements listed above but they include most of the features that indicate that they use explicit information"
" She pushed the door and went into the living room. The room was full of smoke and fire. The furniture was on fire and the house was in flames. She looked around her and saw a baby in a crib that was smoking. She picked up the baby and ran out of the building. In the street she saw a car and a man getting into it. As she ran she realized the baby was hers. She jumped into the car and the man said: 'You saved my life!' Then the man took her home. 

Mary and her baby were safe now. But it would be days before the fire was out. They had lost everything. The man stayed with Mary and her baby. He said they would get another house soon.

This story is based on real events. The man and the car are fictitious, but the baby and the house are real.

"," She put her hand on the knob and opened the door. 'Bother!' she said. 'It's only my husband going to the store.' 'Good!' she thought. 'I hope he doesn't find me here! I'll wait until he leaves and then sneak back into my room.' She tiptoed across the floor and opened the door to her bedroom. She could not believe her eyes! The bed was empty, and the window open! Mary ran downstairs and into the kitchen and found the front door open. She ran out and down the path. 'My bicycle is over there! I'll get it, and I'll get home.' Mary pushed the bike, but it would not start. She tried again, harder. 'It's not my bike! Who would want to steal my bike?' Suddenly a car sped up the road towards her. She screamed and ran into the woods. The car stopped at the house next door. The door opened and a man got out. He looked at the bike and said, 'Don't worry. I know how to start it.' The man came to Mary's house and pushed the button to start the bike. Mary ran to him and embraced him. 

What type of creature was Mary?

Mary was a human.

"," It was the kitchen door. She knocked. 'Rusty, are you awake?' The dog barked back. 'Rusty, Rusty, come on, time to go to sleep.' Then she heard a small voice say, 'Mummy, there's a little brown dog in the kitchen.' 

Mary looked in the kitchen and there was a tiny brown dog lying on a cushion. 'Hello little brown dog. How are you doing?', said Mary. 'Rusty, Rusty, it's Mary, Mary.' The little dog barked and rubbed its head on Mary's leg. 'Good boy, what's your name?'. 'Rusty, Rusty.' 'Well Rusty, when I was a little girl I used to have a pet dog just like you. He was very smart and would always talk to me. I asked him what his name was and he told me it was Rusty. Then one day he disappeared. I never saw him again.' 'But Rusty I thought you lived here now!' 'I did, but I asked his family and he never had one.' 'Where did he live?' 'Well he had a house and a garden and he would come here sometimes to play with his friends.' 'And you'd say his name was Rusty too?' 'Yes, that's right, Rusty.' 'Oh I see, well come on Rusty let's go outside and play.' 'But it's"," She pushed at the door. It opened. She stepped into the room. There was a huge table, many candles on it. There was a chair by the table and next to the chair a child with golden hair was sleeping. Mary watched her as she lay there. She looked so innocent. Mary smiled as she looked at the child. 'How could she do such a thing? How could she steal all my beauty? How could she do this to me?' The child woke up and saw Mary. 'Ah,' said the child. 'It's you. Good morning.' Mary smiled and walked to the chair by the table. She sat down and placed a hand on the golden hair of the sleeping child. 'You are beautiful,' said Mary. 'You are so beautiful.' The child looked at Mary in the candle light. 'And I am sorry,' said Mary. 'I will always love you.' 'But,' said the child, 'I have stolen your beauty. It is not right.' Mary looked sad. 'No,' she said. 'It is not right for anyone to take another person's beauty.' 'But how can I repay you?' said the child. 'How can I make up for what I have done?' Mary thought for a moment and then smiled and said, 'Just tell me a story.' 'Okay,' said the child. 'Would you like a story about the first man and a stone?' 'Oh yes,' said Mary. 'I would love"," The light showed a man sitting at a table. 'Is that man Mary,' she thought. 'No,' said the man 'this is not Mary, it is just a trick of the light.' He got up and they both looked out the window. There was a man in a car below and he was waving. 'I know that man,' said Mary. 'It is my cousin's brother from another mother,' she said. 'What is he doing here.' 'I don't know, he must be coming to see you.' Mary opened the door. 'Thank you,' said the man and he was gone.

Mary walked down the corridor to the parlour. She sat down on the couch and looked out the window at the rain. She heard a car stop outside. She went out and saw her cousin's brother had come to visit.

Mary's cousin was an only child, and had no brothers or sisters. Mary felt close to her. They had grown up in a small village in a small town and had the same tastes in music and literature. 'What are you doing in London,' said Mary. 'My father's job took us away and we needed to get to London as soon as we could.' 'That is a shame,' said Mary. 'I wish we lived closer.' 'Me too,' said her cousin. 'We should get away more. London seems a bit dull sometimes.' 'I would love to go to Paris one day.' Mary"," She put her ear to the door and listened. Suddenly, the door burst open and a man and a woman ran out. 'Oh no, they have come for me! I must hide.' She ran to her room and closed the door. She looked at the clock. 'It is too late; they will have taken me by now!' Suddenly she heard a knock on the door. She opened it and said, 'Oh no, you have come too late! They have already left.' 

She looked in the basket of fruit on the table and pulled out a fig. She picked it up and took it to a quiet part of the room. She sat on the floor and ate the fig. Suddenly the door opened again. The man and woman entered with another man. They took her away. Mary ran to the door and opened it. She saw the man put something into the basket of fruit. He gave it to the woman. 'Now they have forgotten me,' thought Mary. She began to cry.

'Oh, how are you, Tom?'

'I'm fine, Mary. Can I stay the night again?' Tom wanted to know.

'Of course. Come in, it's not cold, just my room. And there's an empty bed if you need to spend the night again.'

Tom hesitated.

'No need to thank me. I'm happy to help,' Mary said. Tom nodded and stepped into the room. Mary put out a chair for him and told him to wait while she made the bed. She listened at the door until she heard her brother climbing into bed.

The following day, Tom and Mary went for a walk around the village. As they walked, Mary thought about what had happened the night before. There was a big noise. She'd heard it before, but when she listened hard, she couldn't hear it again. Then she suddenly heard a voice behind her say: 'It's that sound again!' She turned around and saw a mysterious man standing behind her.

'Do I know you?' she asked, frightened.

'Of course,' he said. 'I'm your brother Tom.'

'Well, it's nice to meet you, Tom.' They started talking about their family and their village. But the man became more mysterious. Suddenly he put a hand on Mary's shoulder. She jumped but didn't lose her"

The following text is a paragraph from the website of a Brazilian company ""AgroBio"":  

We are a leader in the field of research and production of biological products and services to meet the specific needs of today’s industry. Our research team works on a wide range of issues of biotechnology importance, ranging from the characterization of molecular species involved in biosyntheses to studies on the genetics and physiology of microorganisms. We also develop processes for extraction, purification, and formulation of natural products, including antibiotic molecules. Our research is focused on the development of new microbial cell factories for the production of proteins, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and renewable fuels. Our production facilities are designed to meet increasing demand from leading industries in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors."," Luckily there are some parrot species who can talk, which means we humans can have more conversations with them. These parrot species have been called ""languages in the trees"". They learn phrases by listening to their parents. 

There are two types of parrots: free-range and caged. Free-range parrots can live in the wild in our natural habitat but are not owned by anyone. They usually have smaller parrot families and eat only fruits which they have found in the forest. Their parents have to teach them how to eat the food they have found. The parents also teach them phrases like ""thank you"" or ""cheerio"". Caged parrots are usually only used for communication and research. The parrots are kept in large groups and only the parents of each group teach the parrots how to talk. Usually the parents need some training before the children can learn these phrases. 

Some very interesting parrot species are the red-faced cormorant, the green-winged macaw and the spider-baby.


The red-faced cormorant has a very interesting language. The male sings a very beautiful song with long phrases that the female likes to hear. We only know this through the observation of the male. The female usually uses these phrases to teach her young the language. They can even tell if the young one is a female by the song of the male. The green-winged macaw can also"
" He is going to send us lots of teddy bears! I don't have many myself. I hope the holidays are a good time for Jeff! Your teddy bear lover, Greg.


Greg should write a story about how he is feeling right now. He could start by telling what happened yesterday. Then he should describe what happened when Jeff told him about the bad news. He could continue by talking about the holidays and his wish for Jeff's happiness. After that he could describe how he feels right now. He could also mention the bears that Jeff sent him. Greg should remember that his feelings might change over time, so he should not describe his feelings in a rigid or fixed way.


Greg feels bad because yesterday his team lost in volleyball. His friend Jeff who lives in Australia didn't come to visit him during the holidays. He received bears from Jeff because they are very fond of him. This makes Greg feel happy for a moment. He does not want the holidays to be a bad time for Jeff, even though Greg doesn't have many teddy bears of his own.


Greg is feeling happy now, because he can now play volleyball with his friends. He likes the other team much more than his own, which is why he lost yesterday. He also likes his friend Jeff, so he is happy that he could send him lots of bears. Greg could also mention the bears during the holidays before or after the story.


Greg,"," I'm very disappointed because he used to come all the way to Portugal to visit us every year. I feel so bad for him! Do you know if there's any way we can send him a gift? Sure! Here are some ideas: a new tennis racket, new trainers, a nice swimsuit or towel, etc. Are there any specific stores you can recommend? For books, Jeff tends to buy technical books about computer networking, so let's send him a technical book by Microsoft or Oracle. Does that work for you? Great! Many thanks, Greg

Anna responded:

Dear Greg, yes of course it does! Here are some ideas for books Jeff might enjoy: - A technical book by Microsoft about computer networking. - A technical book by Oracle about computer networking. - A computer manual by Dell. Do you have any specific stores you can recommend? For books, Jeff tends to buy technical books about computer networking, so let's send him a technical book by Microsoft or Oracle. Does that work for you? Sure! Many thanks, Anna

Greg responded:

" He pointed to a coconut tree. The tree looked very interesting. ""I wonder how tall that coconut tree is?"" thought Alan. The airplane landed and the passengers quickly disembarked. Alan went to the tree and asked how tall it was. ""It's at least sixty feet tall,"" said one of the natives. ""Wow,"" thought Alan. He started walking around the island. He explored the jungle. It was very mysterious and beautiful. Soon Alan came across a waterfall and he could not stop staring at it. The water was clear and green. Alan started singing: ""Look at the waterfall! It's green and clear! How pretty!"".

Alan came upon a clearing. He saw a huge cathedral in the middle of the forest. He walked into the cathedral and saw rows and rows of gold statues. ""Oh no!"", thought Alan. The statues looked nothing like people. They looked more like large golden mushrooms. ""I'm never going back!"", thought Alan. After two hours, he returned to the airplane. He felt drained and sleepy. He was very happy that he went to the island, but sad he had to return home.

What do you think? Isla Sorna is truly a magical place!

"," ""There are animals there."" The plane landed on the island and Alan got off. He walked down to a beach and saw a very big animal: a tiger! He told his mom about the tiger, and they went to look for the tiger. They saw a sign that said ""tigers live here"" and a small path to a small village. Alan's mom picked him up a stick to help him walk and he saw animals everywhere. They walked through the village until they found the tiger. The tiger was really afraid and ran away. ""It wasn't at all what I expected,"" said Alan. ""I'm never going back to school.""

  * The airplane flew through a blue sky. Alan pulled his hat over his eyes and fell asleep. Hours later he woke up and looked out the window. He could see Isla Sorna. It was very green. The plane flew down to the island and suddenly Alan felt excited. ""Look!"" he said. ""There are animals there."" The plane landed on the island and Alan got off. He walked down to a beach and saw a very big animal: a tiger! He told his mom about the tiger, and they went to look for the tiger.

They walked through the village until they found the tiger. The tiger was really"," His friends were excited too. They looked out the window and saw that there were tall trees and animals. ""Let's go explore!"" his friends said. They put on their shoes and clothes and started to pack their bags. ""Come on Alan, let's go to the airport and find out where we are going."" They started to run. But they could not keep up with Alan.  He was already at the airport. ""We are in Guanacaste,"" he said. His friends were very happy. ""We can go surfing!"", one of them said.  

Alan's friends got their plane and they flew over the trees and animals. It was so beautiful. They saw many animals like monkeys, parrots, and birds. One day they saw a monkey playing soccer. He was very strong. Then they saw a beautiful lake with many kinds of fishes. They saw caiman and alligators. They were happy. Then they found a big tree with many monkeys and parrots. They were also happy. When it was night time, they saw a beautiful cave with many animals. They heard noises like rattles, monkeys, and parrots. It was so exciting. One day they saw a crocodile. He was very big and scary. They ran away as fast as they could. They flew home the next day and Alan's friends were sad because they could not go to the caves.

Alan's friends wrote a letter to Alan about"," ""This is where I grew up.""

Isla Sorna was very green. It had a nice beach and lots of monkeys. Alan explored the island and started to feel lonely. He found a cave that was very dark. Alan wished that he had brought a flashlight.

After a while, Alan heard someone yelling ""Monkeys go bananas!"" Alan ran outside and saw that lots of monkeys were eating bananas. Alan was very happy. He began to go to the island every weekend. His mom got very upset but she started to understand when she looked at the trees on the island. 

One day, Alan saw his brother walking towards the island. His brother was very thin. Alan started to cry because he knew his brother would never come back. 

After a while, Alan's brother got very sick and his mom sent him to the hospital. The doctor said that Alan's brother had brain cancer. Alan didn't believe him. He didn't know what to do. That night, Alan had a dream that the monkeys told him his brother was dead. They showed him pictures and said that his brother was suffering. 

The next day, Alan's brother died. Alan was very sad and went to live with his grandparents on the mainland.

The airplane flew through a blue sky. Alan pulled his hat over his eyes and fell asleep. Hours later he woke up and"," The plane touched down. He jumped out and saw a beautiful house. He walked up to the door and looked through the window. It was made of coral and shards of glass. He walked in and everything was blue. Everything, except the crystal chandelier. The floor was green and he knew he had to get it fixed. After two days of exploring he went to the owner's house. The woman was not there. He decided to call on the island of Tanna. The phone rang but nobody answered. He went out into the yard and saw a man swimming in a pool. He talked to the man for a moment, and then Alan realized he couldn't understand a word the man was saying. He swims to the other side of the pool and Alan can see a helicopter. The man waves and points to a island in the distance. Alan walks there and sees a house made of coral. ""Tammy!"" he says. The door opens and a beautiful woman greets him. He asks her where the crystal chandelier is and she points out a glass shelf. ""I'll fix it right away!"" says Tammy. Alan follows her into the house and sees a table covered in glass shards. He helps her pick up the pieces and put them in a box. She tells him she will get the glass workers to come tomorrow and they start their new life together.


Use the following text to write a story in English about a man who lives"," ""There's a crocodile there."" 

Alan jumped out of the airplane and ran to the crocodile. ""Look what I found!"" he shouted. The crocodile looked at Alan and said, ""Hello.""

Alan replied, ""Hello back.""

 Alan looked at the crocodile closely. It was not a real crocodile, though. He knew this because the crocodile had human skin all over it.

""You're a fake!"" Alan shouted. He picked up a stick and hit the crocodile. The crocodile did not respond. Alan looked closer and saw that part of the crocodile's skin was broken.

""You're a fake!"" Alan said again. Suddenly the crocodile opened its mouth and a jet engine came out. The crocodile closed its mouth and ran away. Alan watched the crocodile run. Then a plane came and crashed into the water. Alan realized the crocodile was only teasing him. 

""Oh,"" said Alan. ""I guess I fell asleep."" He picked up his hat again and looked out the window. The plane was gone and the island was not very green anymore. In fact, it looked like a huge pile of rocks.

" He felt so sad.
A short time later, Curly had stopped fighting and was laying on the ground. Buck went over to her and saw that she was fine. She looked up at him and showed him that she was happy. Curly licked his hand and Buck knew that everything would be OK.


Here is another version of the story, adapted from a children's book written by Rachael Carson:

One day a dog named Curly met a dog named Buck. They were the only dogs in town. Curly was very fast, and Buck was very small.

Buck saw Curly and his paws were full of sticks. He watched Curly push Curly over and she fell on the ground. Buck ran over to help Curly up and they both started to bark with pain.

Buck licked Curly's hand and they both sat down. Buck started to sob and Curly started to lick his hand too.

Shortly after, Curly had stopped fighting and was lying down on the ground. Buck went over to her and he was so happy. Curly licked his hand and they were both fine.


The dogs are the same in both stories. They love and help each other. It's good that the dogs are small like the children in the book so that they can help each other. But they don't have to worry about being attacked by bigger animals.

The other dogs were very angry and they started to attack her again and again. But she was very fast and she ran away from them. So she was safe. Then she returned and heard Buck crying because she thought Curly had been hurt. She came back to Buck and saw that he was very sad. She remembered what happened and she told Buck what had happened.

The dogs bit and kicked him and he couldn't move. He just cried. Then the other dogs started to play with him. The bigger dogs ran around him and played with him. It was so exciting. The smaller dogs played too and showed them how to play ""hunt the squirrel"" on the ground. Buck loved that so much.

As an A2 reader, I have to admit that this story is a bit complicated, but the author did a good job in explaining things to me, at least enough to understand why the animals did what they did.


The main character, Buck, is a young dog, probably about one year old, who lives with his owner, Mrs. Weasley, in a village called Hogwarts. Buck has lots of friends: bigger, less friendly, and more friendly dogs. The more friendly dogs live in a kennel that Mrs. Weasley owns next to the kennel where Buck lives with the other, less friendly dogs. Mrs. Weasley owns about 20 dogs"," He was too fast for Curly and he pushed Curly over so she fell on the ground. The other dogs attacked Curly and she was very sad.

Mr Brown thought about what the man had said and decided he would like to buy the doll, so he went home and asked his mother for advice. His mother looked at the boy and said 'Do you want a new doll or an old doll?' Mr Brown thought for a moment and said 'I want an old doll'. His mother went out and bought him a doll that was very old. When they got home Mr Brown looked at the doll and said 'Hello old friend!' His mother smiled and said 'That is an old doll, I know.' 'But it is beautiful!' said Mr Brown. 'Thank you!' said his mother.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale is a measure of readability for written text and is based on three primary factors: words per sentence, sentences per passage, and words per word.

 The sentence complexity is measured using number of words per sentence, with higher values reflecting more complex sentences. For example, the following sentences contain 7 and 10 words per sentence, respectively. 

Complex sentences are also harder to understand, which is reflected in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale. For example, a passage about the colour of an object could be more easily understood with simple sentences and short words, while a passage about the number of objects in a"," He bought the old doll.

There are many ways to introduce A2 learners to science. One good way would be to tell a story that includes images and visualisations as these are great ways to help A2 learners link ideas and concepts to the real world. Use images of real things that the A2 learner can see. Consider using a picture book or video to make the story relatable and exciting for the A2 learner.


A 2 learner approach to science - An approach that combines information and pictures - is an excellent way to present complex science concepts to these learners.


To introduce A2 Science concepts with pictures and information, follow these steps:

1. Make a list of concepts or ideas that the A2 learner may not be familiar with. For example, the A2 learner may struggle with the concepts of Gravity, Acids and Bases, Electricity, Magnets, Water or even Science in general. 
2. Choose an image that illustrates a concept that is related to the list of concepts that the A2 learner struggles with, such as an acid or a water drop. 
3. Create a story relating the image to the concept, for example an image of an acid can be used to explain the properties of acids. 
4. Create a list of visualisations/images that can","

The story is written in the first person. He is a boy. He has a special friend called Peter. They live in the water and fish for dinner.

The first paragraph introduces the main idea of the text. The boy was happy to be out of the water. He then hit the fish on the head with a rock. This shows his friendly attitude.

The second paragraph introduces another important idea of the text - the boy gave some fish to Peter. This is an example of reciprocal behaviour. Peter is also happy to be part of the giving behaviour.

The third paragraph introduces the last important idea. The boy and Peter took the fish to Mary and cooked them for breakfast.

In this text the language is simple and easy to understand. The words are basic and have simple meanings. There is no need for any complicated expressions or long sentences.

There are no punctuations in this text, but if needed they can be added by the editor.

The text can be published in both written and audio formats. For the audio format, a short narrator (who could be a model/student/friend) can read a short excerpt of the text. The goal of the narrator is to make the text sound natural and easy to understand for the primary school learners.

The written text has 22 sentences, including 6 main clauses, 6 modifiers, 3 adverbs, 3 adjectives, 3 adjectives and 1 question."," They were happy after the meal and watched TV until it was time for them to sleep.

In the story, why is it important to Peter to know that the fish were cooked for breakfast?

The fish were cooked for breakfast because it is a happy ending and they can eat their breakfast now.

The fish were cooked for breakfast because they were hungry after playing in the water and Peter knew that they were going to have breakfast.

Peter knew because he heard Mary telling Peter that the fish were cooked for breakfast and he was happy about it.

Because Mary told Peter, Peter knew that the fish were cooked for breakfast.

Peter knew because Mary told Peter that Peter's mother told her that the fish were cooked for breakfast.

Peter heard his mother telling him that the fish were cooked for breakfast.

Peter heard his mother telling him that the fish were cooked for breakfast.


The passage tells us that it is important for Peter to know that the fish were cooked for breakfast because it is a happy ending and he can eat his breakfast now. This is an example of concrete advice based on a story told to a child. It is unlikely that a two years old child would understand the full implications of the events and the passage is unlikely to be read by the CEFR A2 learner.

  * It is read aloud to a Grade 2 class.

Captain Underpants was just a normal kid until the day a gigantic octopus nearly destroyed the city. Now he is the most heroic pirate in all the land. 

He has gone on countless adventures and brought back a treasure chest of unusual and wondrous items from the farthest reaches of the ocean. He even fought an epic battle with a sea monster.

Captain Underpants fights crime using his famous squid-repelling device, ""Whizzer"" (it's like the superhero alter ego equivalent of the octopus's suckers). He even built his own submarine, the ""Whizzer Snagmore.""

Captain Underpants is truly a force to be reckoned with. In our next adventure, we are going to be taking on a giant robot octopus named ""Rizzo.""

" It was very hot so my mom bought us all ice cream and we were able to sit for a while. After a while we started to get thirsty so we went to the hotel swimming pool. The next day, my mom and I decided to go to the elephant show again. We watched for a while and then I asked if we could go on the elephant ride again but this time there was a younger kid with us. The elephant went down a long tunnel. When we got out at the end, there was a large water tank and a rope ladder. The kid said he would first go to the other end of the tank to throw some food to the elephant and then we would all climb up the rope ladder and go with the elephant to the other side. So we climbed up the ladder and on the other side we found another rope ladder going up to a large tank with the other elephant. So we all went together. We rode the elephants for a long time and watched the show on the other elephants. It was so much fun and I will definitely go to the elephant show again. The elephant show was very good because it was fun to watch and it was nice to ride the elephants. The elephant show was amazing!

Write a story using the following prompt:

The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop age 14 Last summer I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It"," 
  The elephants were led into the square by a large troupe of men in brightly colored shirts. 
  They were very calm and didn't seem worried about this group of strange humans coming into their space. The elephant trainer was talking loudly and encouraging them to do tricks. Suddenly one of the elephants stopped and began to bray loudly. The other elephants started to react and to one side the trainer shouted ""Stop!"" the bray instantly stopped. 
  The trainer then began leading the elephant out of the square. As we were walking away one of the elephants called out to my father, ""Daddy that was the best elephant show I've ever seen!"" 
  My father smiled and said ""Yes, it was very good."" We were a little upset that our vacation had ended so soon. My father told us that the elephants were kept in small groups and not always allowed to go free in the nature. He also mentioned that the elephants are highly trained and that it wasn't an accident that they did so well that day.


There are two elephants in the story. One is the elephant that makes the best show. The other is one of the elephants being kept in a small group and not allowed to go free in the nature.


In the beginning of the story the elephant trainer is encouraging the elephants to do tricks. Suddenly one of the elephants stops and begins to bray loudly. The other elephants start to react and one side of the trainer shouts, ""Stop"," The elephants had arrived and were milling around drinking from a large water tank. They were all huge animals, over a tonne each and were very well groomed. 
  
When the announcer called 'Elephant time!', all of the elephants began to stomp their feet and trumpet. They slowly walked around the square and started chewing the grass and swinging from the giraffes tails. I had never seen anything like it, all of the elephants were making funny trumpeting noises and shaking their trunks. My parents and siblings were laughing too. The announcer said 'next up, the giraffe race' and the elephants all turned and walked away from us. The announcer said 'the baby elephant race' and again the elephants turned around and headed back our way. I was a bit nervous about the baby elephant race so my mom took my hand and we slowly moved down the row of elephants. The announcer said 'The baby elephants are running very fast'. One by one the elephants began running slowly around the square. I couldn't believe it! One of the elephants was only a few months old and it was galloping all over the place. I had seen many animals in my life but I've never seen anything like this! My mom and I were laughing so hard we almost fell off our seats. It was such an amazing sight to see and I will never forget it!


The story 'The Elephant Show' by Daniel Allsop is about"," When we got there we realised that the elephants had left a few hours before. It wasn't long before two elephants arrived in a car. They were huge and seemed very proud of themselves. The driver let us know that they had come from a very good home so that helped to reassure us. The elephants got out of their car and started to move around the square. They lifted their feet and let people climb on their backs. The show didn't last long, it was just a warm up. A little later another elephant arrived and started to amble around the square too. It seemed very unsure of itself. I couldn't help notice that it was badly mistreated with huge lumps and holes all over its body. The driver started to talk to it in a friendly way but it didn't look very happy. As the show started another elephant arrived. The first two had been followed by a procession of elephants and I was getting quite anxious. I kept thinking that the show was about to start and my family would arrive. Then one by one the other elephants arrived. It seemed like there was one elephant for every person who came to the show. We were here for hours, the elephants had a rest every so often but seemed happy to keep going. My feet were killing me by the time we left and I was relieved to be in the car and on our way back to the airport. The elephants were very good fun but they made my trip to Thailand a very unhappy one. My"," There was an elephant, a tiger, and ape on the other side of the square. The tiger and the ape fought and the ape was thrown into the tiger. We thought the ape was dead but then the tiger picked it up and was going to eat it but the elephant stepped in and killed the tiger. Then the ape bit the elephant but then it turned out to be OK. Later on my dad took a photo of me and the elephant in the garden and sent it to my friends. The photo was so cool that my friend decided to buy an elephant of her own. She is also in the photo. I love elephants and elephants love me.

There were also a number of other animals like tigers, wolves and leopards that acted as the story's supporting characters. It was a wonderful show and we went twice to see it. I would definitely recommend taking a trip to a park with an elephant show if you're ever in Thailand.

One of the trainers was making a large elephant move a long rope so you could see how it moved. The elephants were moving really fast and really stiff. Then the other elephant started to move. It looked really funny because it was moving in a weird way. They were both a lot closer to us now and I felt really excited. First the elephants swung their trunks in a really funny way. Then they started moving really fast. It was just lots of fun. The next day my parents and I went to a smaller elephant show at our hotel. It was just a little square with seats on one side. The elephants were still there but they were a lot more relaxed than the big elephants. I liked it a lot better. They were moving really slowly with the trainer making them do different things.

" The other, much easier path, MugeroогAJarma, takes three days and is very popular with school trips. The true test of one's fitness takes eight days to complete the circuit on the West Ridge and then another day to climb up the summit pyramid. Some people have died doing this - you never know who you might save if you take that path. 

On the way up the mountain, one meets various kinds of people. There are Sherpa people, who have been guiding people on the path for many years. Sometimes they don't have the energy to climb with tourists and choose to guide school groups instead. Other people on the path are tourists: they have climbed all the paths around Mount Kilimanjaro, but are taking this route to make a special trip. At night some people will build a bonfire to warm up. On the summit the people will find a traditional thatched hut and some tents for shelter, but no food and no water. Most people will consume the mountain's water on the way down - in fact there is only enough water to keep people alive on the summit. 

One can also choose to climb on the West Ridge. It is not as steep as the Marangu path, but it requires much more endurance. There is also the opportunity to find water on the summit of the mountain, but you will be much more distant from help if you choose this way. A wise decision is to choose the easiest path. If one follows that path"," 

However, there are also many stories of people dying on the mountain. The most famous of these is that of the English mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary and his Nepalese guide, Tenzing Norgay. They climbed the mountain in 1994. They met with many challenges and many difficulties. They were forced to turn back at many times, and in the end, after a struggle, they reached the summit. They then stood at the top of the world for 3 days and nights, with great difficulty, to raise national and world awareness of climate change. 

Many other people have died on the mountain, for example, in 1921 the porters who built the summit lodges died. There are also many stories of people dying on the way down. There have even been some people who had attempted the journey to the summit but failed, falling into mountaineers' nets on the way down and being unable to escape. 

The mountain is very dangerous and it requires a very strong will to climb it. 

Many people have died on the mountain but there have been no fatalities so far this year. This is because this year the United States and China have agreed to carry out a joint survey to measure the snow and ice conditions. This will make it more efficient and also save lives. 

Many other mountaineers have died but not on Kilimanjaro. Some people die on mountains all the time but mountaineers do not normally think of them as"," The less well-travelled Piff-paff path is also recommended as it is shorter. But the climbers say it is harder. The two routes meet at about 3900 meters (12,978 feet). 

The way to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro is not very far from Dar es Salaam. It is around a three-hour drive from the city. People usually spend about five days on the climb. The journey starts at the Kikomara camp site, which is at 2,410 meters (7,341 feet). Most people spend the first two days on the Marangu trail. They then take a two-hour rest break at a higher altitude at Kibo Hut at 3,400 meters (10,856 feet). This is where the porters will take their food, fuel and other things that cannot be carried on the Piff-paff trail. When the porters have enough food, they go back to the Piff-paff trail and bring food and other things to the Kibo Hut for the next climbers. They return again and again to the Kibo Hut until there is enough porter food. The next day they start climbing towards the summit, called Uhuru Top. It is about a seven-hour journey to the top from Kibo hut. The last three hours is the hardest as there is no food. The people at the summit have oxygen and food. There are also few pitons for"," However, people have died on this path. Also, it is difficult to tell if you have reached the summit when you first arrive because of all the clouds. Some people have died on the summit but have not yet realized it. When you reach the summit you get a panoramic view of Kilimanjaro, the Great Rift Valley and the surrounding areas of Tanzania. When you look east you can see snow on the mountain. This is Mount. Shira. Shira is a dormant volcano that formed from a caldera collapse and has been dormant for about 450 years. Some people think that Shira will erupt again and that it is the reason that people have been climbing Mount Kilimanjaro for so long. This is not true, though. 
The story tells the journey to the top of Kilimanjaro and goes into detail about the difficult and dangerous terrain, weather, altitude and the challenges of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.

The average person dies at age 47 of exposure or lack of oxygen. But many people use the East Rongai route, as it’s more physically challenging, and they get more oxygen at the top. There are also stories of people who climbed the mountain barefoot and without oxygen, surviving the ordeal. 
Kilimanjaro is also the name of thehighest peak on the island of Kilimanjaro in the African continent. 
Kilimanjaro can be described as a very tall mountain, with a peak towering 2,819 metres (9,840 feet) above sea level. The mountain is located in Tanzania, near the eastern shores of Lake Kilimanjaro. Mount Kilimanjaro is considered sacred and a holy place by many people in Tanzania. It is believed that the mountain is a sacred place because of the biblical story of Jesus Christ who preached and performed miracle at the mountain, which led to its name. 
Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man.
There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. However, the long and dangerous East Rongai route, which"," However, the Friends of Kilimanjaro organization has been campaigning for years to have a more difficult route, the Uhuru Park trail, approved that takes seven days. Many people don't like the longer route because they say it doesn't look as beautiful, but the Friends of Kilimanjaro say it's more exciting. Mount Kilimanjaro has many trails to it. The Marangu trail is the most popular and is five kilometers long. Many people climb Mount Kilimanjaro with support from tour companies or mountaineering schools. It's also fun to climb with friends, but you'll have to hire a porter to carry your backpack. Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is a great way to learn about how people have tried to get to the top of the mountain, and is a wonderful way to spend time with friends or family.

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. However, the Friends of Kilimanjaro organization has been campaigning for years to have a more difficult route, the Uhuru Park trail, approved that takes seven days. Many people don't like the longer route because they say it doesn't look as beautiful"," Many choose this path because there is an elevator on the top that will take you to the summit in about one hour. However, the steepest path, Kibo route, takes eight to nine hours and is only recommended for experienced climbers. 

The mountain is composed of two peaks - the larger South Peak (8,848 m) and the smaller West Peak (8,828 m). People enter a village called camp I just below the South Peak (8,848 m). From camp I, climbers will go up the east face of the mountain, passing a few camps, until they reach the  South Summit Station (8935 m), where a cable car takes them to the top. From here, they have a 360 degree view of all of Africa. 

At the top of the mountain there is a hotel, a souvenir shop and a restaurant. When you visit Mount Kilimanjaro, make sure to go to the restaurant for their famous dinner. You'll leave the restaurant starving, but unable to bring yourself to eat anything because you have to climb back down in the same conditions as you came up. The hotel restaurant also has a nice view of the mountain. 

The most difficult part of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is the first three to five kilometers of the Marangu path when it is necessary to climb a steep slope covered with loose rock without much snow. The path itself is easy to follow because there is a painted line every"
" They had to go to the captain and ask for his permission to stop the ship. Then the sailors would tell the captain that he knew better than they did.


There were only 3 ways to stop a ship. If you filled the ship with water and let it float or if the tide took the ship out to sea or if the crew rowed against the current. The men on the ship didn't trust their captain. He let the ship sail into a storm because he wanted to find a safe harbor. But there was nothing safe about the storm. The captain decided to do what he thought was best for the ship and the men on board.


Englehorn and Hayes decided that they had to go to the captain and ask for his permission. Englehorn said ""Captain, we need to stop the ship. We can't find a safe harbor in this storm. We're in danger. We have to try and find another route.""


""Oh really?"" the captain said. ""I think you're both very brave to consider stopping the ship in this weather. I'll make a deal with you, I'll give you 10 minutes to work out the details of your plan and I'll take one full minute to give my order."" Englehorn asked, ""Is that okay with you Hayes?""


""Of course!"" the captain said. Englehorn looked at Hayes and said ""10 minutes then!""


Englehorn and Hayes went back to the","  A ship full of water weighs much more than a ship only half full. 

The sailors told Hayes and Englehorn that there was much water under the ship and that it weighed more than the ship alone was worth.  They knew this was not good news as the ship was taking them down the Rio Grande to the Gulf of Mexico.  The sailors didn't know how much time they had before the ship would be swamped.  If they didn't find a port soon they'd surely sink!  

It's now near sunset and the wind is picking up.  Englehorn called the Mayor of Loreto.  He told the Mayor what the sailors had said and what it meant to the passengers.  He asked for permission to put the passengers on deck.  The Mayor agreed and he and three of his sailors escorted the passengers out to the deck.

The passengers on the ship were not happy.  They wanted to go back down into the ship to get to their cabins and away from the rising flood waters.  They didn't want to be in this dangerous situation.  Some were crying and others looked very worried.  

Englehorn gathered up a few men and they talked to the passengers.  They assured them the water was not that deep and that they'd be fine.  They told them to go back into their cabins and remain there.

Englehorn and Hayes returned to the ship and asked the"," So they just kept going until finally the water reached to the very top of the hull. As the ship was sinking, Englehorn called for all the crew to brace themselves for the final plunge. Then the ship capsized and the crew watched as the hull slowly came apart. When it was all over, the men found that they had been in the middle of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland all this time. The water had been so warm that the men had not realized that it was cold. 

In the end, the men realized that they were not alone and that there were thousands of whales swimming along with them. The men called the navy and told them what had happened. The navy sent out a boat and soon a British whaling ship and a American whaling ship showed up to help. With the help of the American whaling ship, the crew was able to signal for help. And in a matter of hours, a French ship with an icebreaker on board showed up and picked up the survivors. They got to Newfoundland safely and Hayes was able to retrieve his family.


""Well done,"" said Mr. Meeks. ""That was an excellent story.""


After a moment of thinking, Mr. Meeks continued. ""The moral of the story is that you can do remarkable things when you work together. In a tight situation like that the crew of the ship did what the crew of the ship was trained to do.""


"," A few men had stepped outside to look up into the rigging to check for air. The rigging was the lines and pulleys that held up the sails of the ship. The men who had climbed to the top of the sails said the water was eight feet deep and rising. The men on the lower decks began to worry. ""We're done for!"" one sailor said. ""If we can't float, we're not getting out of here alive"" another sailor said. But as the water rose, the men on the lower decks began to feel some measure of hope. ""We can float if we move to the forward part of the ship"" one of the men said. So they all started moving to the forward part of the ship, but they found themselves sliding toward the water in the rear. They tried to stop, but it was too late. They slipped under the surface and the waves took them away. The men in the forward part of the ship tried to grab onto anything they could. They were afraid of being pulled under. But they could see the ones in the rear struggling to stay afloat. Then one of the men reached down to grab a rope that hung from the rigging and he started to climb down toward the water. As he reached the water, he started swimming. But the water rose so fast that before he knew it he had reached the surface and was struggling to keep his head above the water. He wanted to save himself, but he couldn't"," The answer was that they didn't know, but they could both feel the ship sinking. 

One solution would be to use this map: Earth - Color Names (the map itself is quite popular as a coloring book).


According to this map, under water in the Caribbean Sea are:

Blue

Both Hayes and Englehorn knew that if they didn't get out of the ship soon, they wouldn't make it. Their ship was sinking and they knew this. They didn't know how much water was under the ship, but they could sense that the ship was sinking. Both men wanted to avoid a rescue operation that they thought would be too dangerous. 

Hayes and Englehorn decided to search for a better weather. This meant that they had to find a way out of the ship, which they could not see. 

They decided to ask the ship's sailors, which were busy getting the life boats ready. The sailors noticed that Hayes and Englehorn wanted to leave and started to tell them about the lifeboats and how to use them.

They told them that there were seven lifeboats and that each man could use one. They also told them that if the boat was full, they should go back to the first lifeboat and wait for another ship to rescue them.

While they were busy telling the sailors what to do, Hayes and"," They were trying to find a way to get Hayes off the ship before it sank. 
While Englehorn and his crew worked hard to get the ship off the water, the ship's carpenter made a plan to get Hayes off the ship. He was going to rig a hook on the rigging to Hayes so that Hayes could climb down from the ship.
  
So the carpenter set about making a hook big enough to fit the giant in it. The carpenter was going to use his own hands to make the hook so the giant would need to help. The giant was excited about this prospect and would be willing to help. 
So the carpenter and the giant worked day and night on the giant hook. Finally the giant hook was done. He put it on a winch and brought it to Hayes so he could climb down from the ship. The giant would climb down first, he was much stronger than Hayes.
""You first, you big bastard,"" Hayes said to the giant. 
But the giant couldn't bring the big hook down from the ship. He said to Hayes, ""The hook's too big."" 
That was a big problem. Hayes said, ""Well, then I'll have to go down first, you big ape."" 
When Hayes saw the big hook, he was excited. He said to the giant, ""You, I'll bring the hook down and you can go back to work."" 
  "," They were just passengers on a ship sailing down the Mississippi river and didn't know much about the water around them. The ship hit a bump in the water and it began to list to one side. Hayes was now really worried. The ship was in danger of sinking. The men on the ship tried to keep the cargo above water but they were only human and couldn't help the ship.  

The story ends with Hayes telling Englehorn to try and reach the shore but the captain says it's too far and there is no way to make it. Hayes tells Englehorn that if the ship does sink there is a treasure buried under the ship. It's a chest containing gold and gems worth millions of dollars! Hayes tells Englehorn it's up to him whether he makes it out of the sinking ship or not. The scene then changes to show Englehorn on the shore with the treasure. He is now very excited and wants to return with his crew to the city to split the money! The narrator says that a second version of the story included in the text includes additional detail about the sinking ship and the treasure chest.

Text: ""Stop the ship! This is too dangerous"" Hayes said to Englehorn. ""We'll get out of here and find better weather"" Englehorn said. ""How much water is under the ship?"" he asked his sailors. Every man on the ship wanted an answer to that question. Englehorn and Hayes didn"

To convince her parents, she decides to travel to London to find investors and start a fashion company. Once she is in London, she checks the internet for inspiration. She finds a vintage shop called ""Retro Vogue"" that sells vintage clothes. She walks in to the shop and stumbles upon a beautiful velvet dress. She was astonished by the price and is sure that it would be great as a first impression for her new business venture. However, the dress is too large for her so she makes an appointment with the owner of the shop to return another day with a smaller size.

When she gets back to the shop the next day, the owner is not there. She looks around and notices that the shop has no owner. She then notices that the velvet dress is gone. She is shocked and starts to panic. She quickly checks the internet to find out that her dress is stolen.

The Young Achiever of the Year  
Kal Kaur Rai
Since childhood, she has always been interested in fashion and has just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents who own a supermarket that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. When her parents unexpectedly died in"," Her parents have always wanted her to study a'suitable' career, but Kal believes that she can do what she enjoys most.

  1. The phrase ""ever since she was a child"" is difficult to understand because it is written in the present tense. The sentence should be rephrased using a past-tense verb.

  2. The word ""parents"" is defined as ""caregivers,"" and is used informally in this sentence. Consider replacing it with ""supermarket owner.""

  3. A common mistake new-generation parents make is to discourage their children from pursuing interests and dreams, even if the child might enjoy it. This is a misunderstanding of the purpose of parenting. Parents, rather than wanting to prevent their children from pursuing what they enjoy, want to see their children grow into happy, well-adjusted adults. By ensuring that their children pursue their interests, they can feel fulfilled in what they do for a living and are able to devote more time to their children, who are in turn able to pursue hobbies of their own.

  4. Consider further rephrasing this sentence using the present-tense verb ""wants.""

  5. ""Although her parents wanted her to study a'suitable' career, Kal believed that she could do what she enjoys most."" This sentence is grammatically correct but contains a few errors. First, the phrase ""although"" is used in its conditional form. Consider"," When she was six years old, while she was drawing dresses, her mother suggested that she take up a needle and thread in order to make clothes for the family. At that time she was shocked and replied, 'Mom, I have already made these dresses ages ago and thrown them away. Why do you want me to do it again?' Her mother explained that this was the way things had always been done and that it was a must if you want to take care of your family. So, little Kal Kaur Rai took up the needle and thread and from then on every day she would find a piece of thread that needed to be mended or a hole in a dress that needed to be ironed. At the age of 11, in school, her teachers praised her excellent attendance, her enthusiasm and interest in subjects and encouraged her to continue this hobby. She explained to her parents that she wanted to study chemical engineering after graduating from school and that she needed to study hard in order to get good grades. Her parents agreed and from that point on Kal Kaur Rai applied herself to her studies with the same enthusiasm as before. She was admitted to the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi. She worked hard during her college days and passed her college examinations with excellent grades. In her final year of college, the Indian Institute of Technology organized a 'National Design Expo'. Kal Kaur Rai organized a fair and exhibited her collection of garments and textiles in the fair. She was adjud"," They wanted her to study medicine, but she left her career of designing and let her parents go to work to support the family. She worked very hard to study design and had to scrap many of her designs. She even worked at a design studio in London. After several months, she had saved up enough money to buy her very own studio in their village. She now owns her own studio and loves every minute of what she does. She designs clothes and has just won a very lucrative job. She is very proud of herself and her achievements and looks forward to celebrating and giving her parents a big  present when the time comes.


Here is an excerpt from Kal Kaur Rai's speech at the Asian Business Awards in London.


""Ever since I was a child, I have always been interested in fashion and have just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to turn my hobby into a career and I never told my hard-working parents who owns a supermarket that I wanted to turn my hobby into a career.

" For one winter all 678 residents of the Ice Hotel in Svalbard would spend 14 hours a day in heated igloos with only a hole cut in the roof to let in the daylight. All food would be heated on the stove and the occupants would only remove their clothing for showers. 

As you can imagine the residents of Svalbard were rather skeptical about the plan but by mid-winter they had all joined the Ice Hotel and were now staying in the heated igloos for 14 hour days. The novelty soon wore off and many of the residents grew bored and started to argue about the merits of staying in the Ice Hotel and the benefits of a darker and colder winter over the much safer and warmer Norway. 

In early April 1989 one of the residents slipped and fell to his death through the hole in the Ice Hotel roof. The news quickly spread through the town and several of the residents started to question their decision to stay in the Ice Hotel. The following months became a series of heated debates on the merits of staying in the Ice Hotel over living in Norway. 

Which brought us to today where the residents of Svalbard are no longer staying in the Ice Hotel but rather in the nearby town of Longyear.


One resident of Svalbard argued against staying in the icy hotel, stating that the residents of Norway were warmer than the inhabitants of Svalbard. Another resident cited the lack of sunlight and fresh air that the inhabitants of the Ice"," With a new hotel opened to accommodate visitors from all over the world and a newly discovered underground river that led directly to a frozen lake in the middle of nowhere, it seemed as though a perfect solution existed to those looking to experience the polar night. However, despite the best efforts of many a guide and a large contingent of tourists arriving by cruise ship, none had ever attempted the journey to the polar hotel. On the day of their arrival, the tourists would find their trip into the unknown complete with a welcoming receptionist and guide.  “Welcome to the polar hotel” the receptionist said with a grin and a shiver. “Here’s your key card and I’ve got the route mapped out for you. Don’t wander too far off course though, there is always a polar bear around. And it’s not too bright, let me show you” She placed her hand out with the palm facing down and the fingers spread. “Just be warned, a polar bear can smell fear”

The Ice Hotel is a fictional hotel and locale in the novel Inception by Nicholas Carr. The hotel is built on top of an underground river in the North Pole and is rumored to be haunted by the spirits of polar bears that have died as a result of staying there. The hotel was built as an Arctic winter resort in the 1980s to appeal to corporate interest, but never fulfilled its potential. At the start of the story, the tourists have arrived to the hotel but","  All the residents would freeze to death and the only tourists left would be the intrepid who wouldn't think of returning in the summer.  The ice hotel was opened and as the days shortened the tourists started to arrive. The ice hotel was constructed of thick insulated concrete panels and featured a sauna, ice lounge and numerous guest rooms with en suite facilities.  The hotel was a great success and has been visited by celebrities, tourists and curious local residents ever since.

Any reputable study will tell you that statistics can be misleading when trying to present information to a general audience.

These","  Two teams of five staff members were selected to operate the only hotel in the Arctic; the only problem was the hotel was only open for the summer season, and only in the summer season. 

A team from Sweden arrived to open the hotel. The Swedish team consisted of a chief engineer, a chef, a masseuse, a hairdresser and a minder. 

The Swedes started their work on the 13th of June. First, the Swedes installed all of the central heating, the ice machine, the bar and installed the lifts. Then the Swedes brought in all of the required furniture, including six beds, a bar fridge and a TV. 

When all of the furniture was in place, the Swedes began to decorate the hotel. First, the Swedes painted the walls and put up a large banner that read “Ice Hotel” on the front desk. They also cleared away all the old ice from the previous summer and brought in new ice that had not yet melted. 

After a month had passed, the Swedes declared the hotel to be ready for visitors. When the tourists arrived, they were given the new ice, a snowman, and a bottle of “Arctic Monsoonal”. Then the tourists were taken to the hotel. When they arrived at the hotel they were taken to their rooms, the minder was instructed to switch on all the lights in the rooms and after a while they were taken out to"," The Icehotel was built to be entirely accessible only by sledge in the winter time. Each guest of the Icehotel would be supplied with a sleeping bag, sleeping jacket, woollen mittens and a warm duvet. The duvet would be warmed during the night by electric heaters which had to be plugged into the town's power supply. During the winter of 1984 to 1985 there were only 4 guests of the Icehotel at a time and there was no food in the hotel. Due to the lack of guests there was enough food left to preserve with perishing. The perishing food had to be consumed by the guests of the Icehotel once the last guest was woken up in the morning. On a clear night a visitor could see the Northern Lights from the hotel. It was a real disappointment to wake up in the morning only to see that the food had all perished due to the cold. However, there were no dead birds, rats or mice in the hotel.


What causes the perishing of food in an Icehotel in the winter? What happens to the food once the last guest wakes up?


The cause of the perishing of food in an Icehotel in the winter is the complete lack of guests. During the winter of 1984 to 1985 there were only 4 guests of the Icehotel at a time and there was no food in the hotel. Due to the lack of guests there was enough food left to preserve"," 

The Icehotel was a floating city designed by architect Olav Knudsen and built of reinforced concrete, glass and ice. It was the first ice hotel and had 300 bedrooms. All guests had complimentary ice for the day and all staff were volunteers. The first guests arrived in 1983 but the hotel had its first major ice crisis in 1988. The city was only open from late November to mid-April. In 1991 the hotel was opened to the public for a one-off night. The hotel was demolished in 2005 as the city's future was in doubt.

	The Icehotel was built in 1983.

	The Icehotel was opened to the public for a one-off night in 1991.

	The Icehotel was closed in 1991 due to a major ice crisis.

After a difficult start the business grew, and soon people from all over the world were able to experience the Arctic in the winters of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. 
  
In 1993 the hotel made a television advertisement that quickly went viral on YouTube, and the Ice Hotel became a popular winter destination. By the end of the 1990s the hotel had opened, and was so popular that new caverns had to be built in the mountains to accommodate the growing number of tourists. 
  
Since then, the hotel has seen a continuous rise in popularity and visitors. In 2007 the hotel had an average of 13,000 visitors per day. In 2014 the hotel hosted its 500,000th visitor, which at that time was the most visitors ever hosted at the hotel. However, in 2016 the hotel was not able to host its 1000,000th visitor due to a maintenance issue. This did not stop the number of visitors from rising to its 10 millionth visitor in 2018. The Ice Hotel has even hosted its one billionth visitor in the year 2023, which is an estimated 3,500 visitors. 
  
The hotel has 28 caverns that are open all year round, and are filled with icicles, snow and ice. The highest temperature that the hotel has ever hosted is 8 °C and is"
" When you hit the ridge it gets very windy so we stopped and huddled round a small gas heater. The first part of the climb was straightforward, the ridge was easy to climb, although there were some small ice patches on the slope. Our route was on the obvious line up to Tower Ridge so we were only moving a couple of feet each hour. The really hard part was on the other side of the tower where the ridge steepens to a huge south face. It was very crowded round the small gas heater on the way down. It would take a lot more than a couple of feet per hour to get down that face and we knew we had to get down to the col below before nightfall. We moved away from the ridge into a long, easy groove which we knew would take us down to the col. After about an hour we reached the col and to our great relief there was a big, wide, empty snow plateau below. We were all over the place for a few minutes trying to get our heads down in the deep snow, it was a real moment of panic for me because I was last in the line, but after a few minutes I was in and next to a small cave. We were all laughing and shaking with laughter. We decided it was best to leave the tent inside and risk an avalanche if we were found later. It was now dark and we knew there would be a lot of crevasses below. We radioed for more help to come"," It was a long, hard route and just after 3 o'clock we reached the summit of the hill. The views were incredible. We had a panoramic view of the entire Scottish Highlands to the west of us. To the east, as far as the eye could see to the North Sea and also the mainland coast of England. We were all in raptures, shouting at the tops of our voices, falling over each other to get our photos taken and feeling elated and proud. Keith had a sense something wasn't right, he couldn't stop shaking. I suggested he had gained too much weight, but he brushed me off, suggesting he might just be excited. We set off down the other side of the mountain, feeling great. Only after we had crossed a small river did I realise I could see Tower ridge in the distance. As the distance closed between us, I grew increasingly worried. I called out his name. No reply. He was nowhere in sight. It was getting dark and I was losing height fast. I looked around desperately. My heart sank as I saw him below me, making his way down the other side of the river. I shouted his name again, but I knew it was too late. He was gone. I have never forgotten the look of agony on his face as he clambered back to the riverside. I never saw or spoke to him again. Many years later, when I became a mountaineer, I tried to climb Ben Nev"," I'd read about this feature and it was steep and exposed, but as we started it the snow began to soften and the ice to melt.  I could see over the crest of the ridge below to the Eryms Ghyll valley and the sea beyond.  My friend Pete and I had decided to bring two avalanche transceivers on our climb so we could be fully prepared should the mountains face turn out to be unstable. But it was a great view and I was buzzing.  As we reached the crest of the ridge we could see the summit cairn about a mile away. We had expected to be descending immediately, but the weather had deteriorated and there was no sign of a cloudburst so we decided to make our way back down the face instead. I must admit I wasn't too bothered. There is a small ice slope at the bottom of the north face that drops off steeply into the Eryms Ghyll valley.  Looking back down the ridge when we reached the bottom of the face I was surprised to see how far we had descended. But we'd made it, and we were only a few hundred metres from the summit cairn. As we approached it I became aware of a strange noise; the noise of the wind in the Eryms Ghyll valley, not so much the howling force eight wind of the winter mountains but a faint susurrus that was growing in volume with every passing gust. My first instinct"," I was amazed that the weather had allowed us to climb the mountain. The north face is a brutal scramble but our route was through old growth forest where we didn’t have to worry about losing our footing. In fact, our rope allowed us to scale steep ice patches without the need to move sideways. I’d heard of people who had died on Ben Nevis but never imagined I’d be in that situation myself. On the top of the mountain we shed our heavy crampons and snowshoes and had a meal. I couldn’t believe it had been that difficult to get to the top and was anxious to do it again. Ben Nevis is only one of dozens of mountains around the world that draw people to Scotland. Some come to hike, others to snow ski or rock climb. I plan to climb the mountain again. I’m now working as a guide for the Alpine Club of Scotland and enjoy teaching other people about the outdoors. 

A story that is readable by Grade 2 learners in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale using the following prompt:

  * Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland and because of its northerly location the climate can be bitterly cold. 
  * Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. 
  * It was February his first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge.

  *"," I knew I was in for a shock. Ben Nevis is famous for it's severe weather which can change rapidly. It was windy when we set off but as we went up the mountain it started to moderate. Eventually we topped out and were immediately greeted by sunshine. It was a welcome change after being stuck in the wind for so many hours. But as we started descending there was a huge clap of thunder and a flash of lightening. It was with great reluctance that we decided to turn back. I still remember looking up at the thunderstorm and thinking to myself it's not looking too friendly but then I realised it was probably just another one of the weather patterns that makes Ben Nevis such an adventure. The thunder and lightning were so memorable though and I will never forget them. 

Keith Hewitt is an experienced and talented climber. He is 42 years old and lives in Scotland. He describes his first time on Ben Nevis, a peak in the Grampian Mountains of Scotland. 

Ben Nevis is a 310m high mountain in the Great Britain group of the larger Ben Nevis Range. The peak has a north and south face. The peak is located about 75 miles northwest of Glasgow. 

Ben Nevis is famous for its severe weather which can change rapidly, including wind, rain, snow and sometimes thunderstorm.

 Climber Keith Hewitt is 42 years old and lives in Scotland. He describes his first time on Ben Nev"," There was no path and the snow was packed hard and we struggled to climb through it. It was around ten o’clock at night when we reached the summit. Looking back I could see the city of Edinburgh. We didn’t stop there, instead we went down the south side of the mountain. There are hundreds of feet of drop so if you slip the worst that will happen is you will fall some hundreds of feet. We went down the scree slope. It was snowing heavily but we continued to descend until we were on the flats. We felt tired but elated. I knew that this was just the beginning of our big winter climb and one day we would reach the summit of the Seven Summits.

Ben Nevis is located in Scotland and is a mountain that millions of people have climbed. The climate on the mountain is bitterly cold and can be dangerous to climb. Keith Hewitt first climbed Ben Nevis in February of 1986. It was his first time on Ben"," Tower Ridge is a small knoll to the left of the main peak. To get to Tower Ridge we first had to scramble up the shoulder of the mountain. That part was OK - the weather had been clear and the snow dry. Our route took us to the edge of the Larch Hill couloir. From the couloir it was a steep scramble down to the flat summit plateau.  

On the way to Tower Ridge we stopped at another knob called Balmoral Castle. Balmoral Castle is a rocky outcrop with a large and impressive castle built on top of it. The castle was built in the 1870s for the 8th Duke of Atholl. 

After reaching the Castle we had a short scramble to the crest of the ridge. The view from the top of the Balmoral Castle was fantastic. It was a clear day with no cloud in the sky and all the way to the southern horizon you could see the Mediterranean Sea.

We had a few hours up the hill, so we had some lunch and tried to nap. But we were soon on our way again. Our route was very exposed and also climbed a section of loose rock so we had to use ice tools for part of the way. Our route took us up the west ridge to our destination - Tower Ridge.  

As we got closer to the summit we could see a huge cloud moving in from the west. This was very disappointing. It would"

" Women would stand on the sidelines of a running race whilst men ran the event, I felt the women should be part of the running too. There was a woman I knew who ran and she was so motivated to get out and run that she joined me. From there we started the running group and trained twice a week. We introduced beginners and pushed them to run 5 miles a week but they kept pushing to 10 or even 15. We got sponsors and raised money for charity and now we have over 30 women running and competing in local and national running events. Running has given me so much confidence and I now run regularly 5-15 miles a week and enjoy it. 

Running has had a big impact on my life and has given me a new lease of life. My back injury forced me to take a break from running but by introducing more women to the sport I have been able to push myself to run and feel alive. Running has encouraged me to get out and see the world and enjoy life. Running has become a family tradition with my two daughters now running alongside me. Running has helped me get fit and healthy, it has been a stress reliever and taken me to new places. Running allows me to keep active and also be social and enjoy myself. I feel proud to be a member of the Running Dub for Women group and look forward to running with my friends. I am proud to have introduced running to more women and hope to inspire more women to get out and running."," Running was not seen as a real sport, and women were encouraged to take up the sport if they had injured their back. I thought to myself, if they can’t run why should they compete? 
  I started a running club in my local park. The first ladies I introduced to the sport were my daughters. We ran 5 kilometers one Saturday morning. My daughter said that she had always wanted to try running but was scared because she had injured her back a few months previously. I took her to the physio and she was prescribed pain killers and exercises to do at home. She said that she would try again later on, and we agreed that we would run our 5 kilometer next weekend. That weekend she texted me to say she was going to try running again and she had found a great local running track. She was able to run the 5 kilometers that we had run the previous weekend, and she said that she was now ready to go on the roads. I was so happy for her, and so was the local running club. We decided to organise a half marathon in the spring, and this is when my youngest daughter decided to join our running club. She had been running for some time but was always a slow runner, but since she had started running with us she had improved rapidly. In a few months she was running with the club and was now training at least 3 times a week. She has also now got her own running group. 
  Our club"," They wouldn't book a woman in unless I had to pay for the entry. Running for women is a great sport but the barrier of entry has to be lowered. 

The story should provide advice to encourage more women to get into running.

I think that introducing more women to running and showing them that running can be fun is a good way to encourage more women to get into running. I started a running club for women in my area so that more race organisers would let them run. I paid for any entries they had to pay to have a runner on the course.

  Advice for the author - Don't just take a break from running. introduce more women to the sport to show them that running can be fun and give them the confidence to get out and run.

  Information for the author - Running is an excellent sport that is fun for all ages and abilities. Introducing more women to running can help encourage more women to get into running. I paid for the runners and any entries they had.

  Thanks for writing this interesting and informative story!

"," They would not allow women in most races and told the women to find their own way to run rather than giving them the opportunity to enjoy themselves. I was also concerned about women’s health. It has been well documented that running can increase your risk of certain types of cancers. I wanted to ensure that women could still enjoy their running whilst remaining safe. I started a running group for women with training plans, race reports and a Facebook page so they could stay connected. The sport has doubled in size in the year since I started and more women are getting involved. The increase in women has been great for the health of the running community.


The text is too complicated and the language too formal.  There is a lack of specific details and examples to support the text.  There are multiple clunky sentences in the passage and the last sentence could be improved.  A more concise way of expressing the sentiment might be:

I had seen so many women fail at races which I thought would be an insult to their talent and I wanted to change that! I soon realised running is a great sport which anyone of all abilities can enjoy and my local running club is now full of women who wouldn’t have run had it not been for my passion for the sport. As a result of my running, I’ve met some amazing people and have even been involved with organising my own running club! It is now the proud role of my husband to support me with my new found passion and I have introduced my daughters to the sport as well. Running has given me new friends, confidence and most importantly fun. I hope to continue running for many years to come.

  

Women's running club at the Royal Marines Centre of Excellence

  

The Royal Marines Centre of Excellence has a running club which has a number of members who are women. The club runs two runs a week - one run before and after school which is intended for beginners and another run for those who are more experienced. Although only one woman, the club is very male-friendly which is testament to the success that running has for women in the community.

  

Through running, I have introduced new friends, confidence and most importantly fun. I hope to continue running for many years to come.

  

Women's running club"," Instead of encouraging women to run, they complained that there were not enough women taking part. 
  
Title Running is a sport that gives you the health benefits of exercise and the fun of being active. It gives you the confidence to get out and do something you enjoy. In the past when I introduced more women to running it was harder to find suitable training facilities and the sport was less popular. However, since starting the running dub for women I noticed a huge increase in new runners and more race organisers were starting to encourage women to run. Running is now a popular sport that allows many women to get the exercise they need and still have fun.

There are several important facts about grasses. 

- They are the most numerous of all flowering plants and are found in every habitat on Earth
- There are over 9000 different types of grasses and they are the single flowering plants that can live in the freezing Arctic and Antarctic. 
- They are the main food source for cows, sheep and goats and are an important source of protein in many parts of the world. 

There are several reasons why grasses are so successful. Firstly they can grow anywhere - not just near water. Secondly they fix carbon which means they can grow in land that is currently not suitable for crop farming. Thirdly they have long life cycle which means they can reproduce easily and quickly.

Despite their success, grasses face many challenges. First they are one of the least diverse families of plants. Secondly they are one of the slowest growing plants. Thirdly they have a very poor ability to move from place to place. 

As a result of these issues, grasses face a range of threats including land degradation, climate change and overexploitation. In some cases grassland has been turned into desert. 

Another serious problem facing grasses is they are becoming endangered. For example in the UK about 50 percent of meadows are thought to be in danger of disappearing in the coming years. 

Despite these challenges, grasses are very likely the most successful living plant in the world.


Write a"," The reason grasses are so successful is because they fix the nutrients they take in through the roots from the soil into the carbon they contain. This means that grasses are very important to the ecosystem and not just the animals that eat them. Grass is a living thing that deserves to be celebrated.

The grasses in our garden are all from previous years collections and the varieties are constantly changing as more varieties come into existence. Some are more productive than others and this determines the prices we get for our lawn. This year we've seen different types of clover and a species of reed grass which is very rare in these parts. 

Grasses are the most important and valuable of all plants because they can be converted into green fuel to run cars and other machines. The fuel can be converted back into plant food so the grasses can grow more. The fuel can be converted back into normal carbon dioxide so the grasses will be forced to grow more even faster. The fuel is also very light so it can be spread quickly over huge areas. 

This ability to grow everywhere has made this species of grass highly successful and many other species of grasses are extinct. 

Grasses have a way of knowing when it is time to die. All living things need to be replaced at some point and the grasses that don't get replaced die. They are replaced by other grasses and this process continues on. 

We all need to learn from the grasses in our garden and do what is best for our lawn.

Grass is one of the most important products we grow in Canada. It supports a wide variety of wildlife. It is the second most grown crop in Canada after grain. There are over 300 types of grass growing in Manitoba alone. The grasses include hardy types that will grow in the most harshest environments. The greenest grass comes from Saskatchewan.

Despite its success as a crop and animal food, grasses have very large populations of deer in the western US. They are not hunted because they are agricultural plants not wildlife.

Grass grows best in a well-maintained lawn. People spend $9 billion a year on grass seed and chemicals. It is also grown to make turf in public parks.

One type of grass grown in Manitoba is a plant called bison grass that is the same species of grass as the American bison that became extinct in the 1800s. Bison is the same animal as the American cow but instead of beef they eat grass and are a protected species.

One of the most famous grasses to human is a soft drink called cola that originated in the Caribbean. Cola is not a grass but originated from the kola nut. This is a type of nut similar to the almond in the Mediterranean.

Animals like the bison are symbols of our country and the grass is just a plant.

When the team beat another team in a local competition, the other team complained.  Maria Mutola's story was written in a local newspaper and then it was shared across the African continent by a man, Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes to believe that more women would be added to teams in the future.  

It is important that more girls and women are represented in sport as it improves mental health and confidence for women.  It promotes a sense of belonging, and helps girls and women achieve their goals whether it is running a marathon, or playing netball competitively"," 'I was amazed to find so many girls playing football in Africa' he said. Soon after Maria was offered a place to study and play football at a higher level in Portugal. She has now represented her country at world championships and won the gold medal at the European Championship.

* The prompt should be used as a starting point and you should consider the story to be written from the perspective of a male student (in this case, of the Portuguese coach).
* The language in this story is very formal, with many complex verb forms (e.g. 'we won') which requires intermediate to advanced level skills.
* We would point out that Maria is not the only girl in the team - indeed, as a rule women are not allowed to play football in many parts of the world.
* The use of the present continuous form of the verb in the first part of the story helps to create a feeling of continuity and allows the reader to feel that the context of the story is still in tact - Maria's comment 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl' is still relevant now (in the present tense).

" Today over a hundred hot air balloons take part in the event, competing in events ranging from the prestigious $100,000 ""Big Blowdown"" to the friendly ""You Win the Balloon Game.""  The festival is popular among locals and tourists, attracting upwards of 300,000 visitors over the course of the festival.  The balloons are a feature of the festival, and often form large, beautiful patterns in the sky. The festival is a community event, and thousands of people come to witness and enjoy the balloons in the skies above the city. The festival is well run, and is considered to be a true celebration of the city of Albuquerque. However, the presence of the balloon festival has caused some friction between city officials and local residents who object to the noise, mess, traffic and litter created by the balloons. A petition requesting the removal of the balloons from the festival has received more than 30,000 signatures, though no one has stepped up to challenge the festival at the ballot box in recent years. The balloon festival continues to take place each year, and is one of the largest festivals in New Mexico. 

The petition is misleading. While the balloon festival may be noisy, it is not actually a festival. There are many similar festivals, and Albuquerque does not deserve much blame for acknowledging the existence of other festivals and hosting those festivals. 

The festival has been hosted for many years without the concerns expressed in the petition. Furthermore, the festival has"," The festival now draws some 300,000 people a year and over two million people view the event on TV each year. Many of these people visit the city to see the stunning aerial displays created by tens of thousands of hot air balloons and airships. The festival is sponsored by local business such as the city of Albuquerque itself, General Electric and Nike. The festival is open to the public and tickets are relatively inexpensive. Some events such as the Parade of the Bubblemen, which brings in thousands of visitors and millions of viewers, are even free. The festival draws criticism, however, for its reliance on airships, balloonists who must follow strict safety guidelines and take safety precautions and for spending too much on security when the festival has often been accused of being a money-making venture. The city of Albuquerque is considering whether to offer a refund for tickets purchased and not used. The festival is one of the largest of its kind in the world.

  * Albuquerque, New Mexico has one of the largest balloon festivals in the world. During the nine-day festival every year, the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque changes into a mass of colourful balloons. This festival is well known and popular, drawing thousands of visitors and millions of viewers every year. Despite the fact that it's now been criticized for relying on airships and airballoonists, the city of Albuquerque does not intend to give refunds","  Over the next two decades the event grew to draw tens of thousands of spectators and millions of people around the world watched the balloons perform stunts in the sky. The festival had a number of contributing factors. The weather during the festival was usually clear and generally warm. The city is located near a airport allowing easy transport of attendees. The event provided entertainment for the large number of children in the city.  However, the festival faced competition from other cities wanting to be the centre of the balloon mania. 

In recent years the event has been plagued by a number of safety issues that put lives at risk. The balloonregistration process was considered to be too bureaucratic and safety procedures were not adhered to. Many of the balloon companies did not adhere to the guidelines for balloon operations and many of the balloon companies that did adhere to the guidelines did not attend the festivals on past years. However, it would seem the safety record is improving.

  * The event"," In 2018 Albuquerque had its 55th Annual Balloon festival. Over 250,000 people are estimated to visit the festival grounds each year and thousands of people earn their living by selling balloons, hotdogs and balloon animals for the event. Each festival stands out from the others because the shape and colour of the balloons can vary substantially. This is because the festival takes advantage of an atmospheric condition that causes lighter-than-air objects to float upwards in the shape of a sphere when the surrounding air is warmer than 0 degrees celsius. This is why the festival's colour is mainly red, yellow and blue.  The festival takes a few days before the start and many more days afterwards with the participants assembling their elaborate creations from a wide range of materials, ranging from helium-filled balloons to wood, paper and trash. The festival has grown significantly over the years. Many people travel from all over the world to take part, some even for the first time. This is due to social media, which has helped to popularize the festival, both online and offline. Some of the online celebrities that are known to promote the festival include Brian Vran, who has become known for his appearances at the festival, and the local radio station that has become synonymous with the festival's name. The festival stands out from the others because the shape and colour of the balloons can vary substantially. Balloons with animal faces and people's faces on them are very popular. This is because at that altitude,"," Over three thousand balloons fill the sky. Hundreds of teams from all around the world compete to launch the most expensive and the most exotic balloons. The festival draws millions of tourists each year. The festival is not only a popular local event. Many companies launch balloons for advertising purposes. In addition, the festival offers a wide range of activities for both children and adults. There are also many local and national activities during the festival. For example, there is a parade, a fashion show, several concerts and many other events. In recent years, the festival has also had a strong presence on social media, often holding live broadcasts on Facebook and Twitter. The festival has even sponsored a local brewery that offers beer for just a few dollars. The festival is an extremely popular cultural event that is very well organised and attended by both children and adults. Although a popular local event, the festival has spread throughout the state and now also takes place in nearby Santa Fe. The festival is an example of how the media can influence what gets popular and how social media can facilitate this. Balloon launched during the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. 

Albuquerque is an attractive city with desert landscapes and a friendly population of diverse cultures. This makes it a popular tourist destination. The festival is one of the highlights of the local festival calendar. Over three thousand balloons fill the city skies. There are several thousand people involved in organizing and running the festival. Both local residents and visitors are enthusiastic about the festival."," The event has grown to attract tens of thousands of visitors and a colorful international air fleet. 
On the first day of the festival, which takes place in late October, tens of thousands of people converge on Albuquerque's Sky Acres airport, a grassy area near the city centre that has been turned into a huge field of balloons. The festival starts on the third day with air shows, followed by a week of demonstrations of new and classic models from manufacturers including LaMotte, Paramount, Burt Rutan, and Mooney. Special events and attractions include art and science displays, children's activities, and a car show.  Many air travelers use Albuquerque's only airport, which is about an hour away from the city centre, to save on air-fares. Some also drive as far as possible so their children can visit the festival. The festivities wrap up on the last day of the festival on the Albuquerque Convention Center. Tickets for the whole weekend can cost up to US$200 depending on where you get them.
The balloon festival is a great opportunity to see modern designs such as the Rutan aircraft and the giant helium-filled ""spaceships"" used at the 1937 World's Fair in Chicago, IL. In addition, many visitors find nostalgic childhood memories in the displays of vintage models, from the B-17 and B-29 bombers used in the Second World War to the Spads and P-39"," More than 200,000 people turned out to watch the balloons fly each day. Over the years attendance dwindled but the annual event still brings thousands of people to the desert. The festival begins on the first day of September. The first day is known as the 'National Day' and is a celebration of America's history and culture and includes many traditions including eating pecan pudding and listening to the 'Flight of the Vagabond'. Early morning flights take place on September 1st. These are usually small, non-winged models but sometimes, occasionally, larger models will take to the skies. The balloon flight includes an ascent from the desert in the early hours of the morning before they land in a field adjacent to the Albuquerque Convention Center. Early risers who are able to join in the festivities are rewarded with the best seats in the house. The Convention Center is a large dome-shaped building with a tall arch which stands tall and proud on the front. The building contains a theatre which showcases all the balloons which have taken flight over the years. Outside, people of all ages can take part in activities. Children can run around the spacious lawn area which is decorated with plenty of toys and bright colours. There are also several restaurants offering breakfast and lunch, as well as a large food court. Outside, the Convention Center boasts several stages which host live music and dancing.

The Rocky Mountain Tourist is a beautiful old train which covers the mountainous areas of the Rocky Mountains. Travelling at a leisurely pace the train has many cars with private compartments, two dining cars and a bar. In total the train has over twenty cars and is considered a step up from the Rocky Mountain Express.

This is a story about the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west but lie only a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies but the best way to see them is to travel by train. Over the"," Trains can go over the mountains and through the heart of the Rockies. Trains that run through the Rockies are called The Great Divide.  They stop at the very northern most point of North America in Jasper National Park, Canada.  When people travel by train through the Rockies they usually look out of the windows to see nature's most beautiful sight.  The trees, the colours, the way the land changes from one valley to the next.  It is easy to see why The Rockies inspired the American Indians to call them ""The Mountain People"".  The mountain people lived here in the past and they live there now.  In some ways The Mountain People look like us but in other ways they are not like us.  They are smaller and lighter in build.  Their skin is a golden colour.  Their hair is long, flowing and almost black.  They wear different clothing to how we dress.  They live in tepee-shaped buildings made of spruce and pine trees.  They have special names for each day of the calendar.  The Mountain people believe in a Creator.  They do their own thing.  They have had horses for many generations.  They have a belief in the four directions that the creator points to.  In some ways they remind me of the Cherokee Indians who call their country home.  We will find out when we go there.  The Great Divide trains go through Jasper National Park in Canada"," The railroad was built to transport coal and ore but it also has beautiful mountain trains that travel over the Rockies. The trains go from one city to another, passing through beautiful scenery and stopping at small towns along the way. The mountains are impressive because they have a diversity of vegetation, ranging from snow-covered mountains in the winter to desert areas in the summer. Each year many tourists come to visit the Rockies and many of them travel by train to see the mountains. The tracks wind their way around lakes and across mountain passes, providing tourists with a scenic view of the mountains, sometimes stopping to let passengers get a closer look at the beautiful scenery. Tourists often return again and again, visiting the same towns and riding the same trains, taking photos and imagining what the mountains might look like at another time of the year. Although the Rockies are a large mountain range, they are actually quite easy to get around. Because there are so many roads and trains that travel across them, it is easy to go to many of the mountain towns that are on the way from one part of the range to another. 

Give examples of interesting train trips through the Rockies that might include scenery, a city and a town.


THE ROCKIES In the past people travelled across the Rockies by foot. However, with the building of the railroad, this method of travel became easier. Travellers could now get to the mountains by train, enjoying beautiful scenery along the way. The different"," You get an exhilarating feeling as the locomotive picks up speed.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a readability metric using single words, single sentences, and single syllables to determine the grade level of a text.

Flesch and Kincaid originated their formulas in the mid-20th century while studying what at the time were empirical correlations between a text’s appearance and readability. In contrast to this, nowadays many readability scales are intended to be “human readable” and account for more complex aspects of how a text is written.


Reading grade levels for grades 3 - 6

There are three grades in the Flesch-Kincaid grade level scale, corresponding to three grade levels in school. The lower the grade level, the easier it is to understand what was written. The following are texts for each grade level in the Flesch-Kincaid grade level scale:

Grade 3: Texts with 100 - 109 words

Grade 4: Texts with 500 - 579 words

Grade 5: Texts with 1000 - 10,999 words


The text at the lower grade level has a higher Flesch-Kincaid grade level, as the formula considers word counts, sentence counts, and syllables in the text, in that order.

" The children learn about food safety, how to cut, chop, pan-fry, steam and roast meat, fish and vegetables. They get to taste different types of food that they have made and eat at a buffet provided by the restaurant. Parents pay the course price to the instructor but they can also book a table at the restaurant for their child to be given a diploma that is sent to an award ceremony. It is a fun course but will give their child the skills to start their own restaurant when they are older and the business is more secure.


Little Chefs is a serious course where children learn to cook good food with friends. Each month children who are interested can join a small class to do a recipe and learn how to cook the dish. Parents pay for the course and have the opportunity to dine at a restaurant with their children as a celebration of the children's work. It is a serious course with a lot of fun involved.


Parents who are interested in Little Chefs should speak to their GP before considering any course, as for some patients child obesity is a problem. This may require additional surgery and diet.


Little Chefs is an idea from a chef who has created this course in her own home. She also runs a restaurant with her children, who have had certificates for their work at the restaurant.


The parent says, ""There are 30 on the waiting list and there are lots of parents from our village who have paid"," 
  But the group of children want to run their own restaurant and hire out the restaurant rooms to other groups of children who can’t afford the course but would like to take part in the fun of cooking for a meal for two.
The group of children, led by their cook, decide to become “Little Chefs” and invite 15 other children to join them. The invitees will get an invitation letter with their details.
The children need to choose one of the 11 rooms in the restaurant, think about why they want to run the restaurant and how they can make it a success.
The children can choose for the restaurant rooms in different ways. For example, a child could choose a room because they have never cooked before. The room could be very expensive and the money they could earn would be very good to run a restaurant.
Another way is for a child to choose a room because he or she likes cooking and they could be the chef. The other children could be the customers and their parents would be paying for the course.
The restaurant can have a very nice menu. The children could invite the parents to the restaurant for lunch so they can earn more money. 
  They could also invite a friend or two, so they could earn more money. 
  They could even be able to use the restaurant for fun and can earn a bit of money for the parents or for themselves.
The children can cook some special dishes for their customers or for themselves."," But some parents do not agree with this as they feel it is a waste of valuable time for the children to be learning this in a classroom when they could be playing with each other in the weekend club. If you were in charge of organising these lessons, what would you do? Here is an extract from the letter from the parents: Dear Team, I am writing to protest against your decision to hold weekly lessons in a classroom for the children. Your children are not at school to learn and are getting the opportunity to play and enjoy themselves. The course is a waste of time for children, and an insult to parents, who are trying to enjoy their weekends with their children. Please don't go ahead with this course. All the best  Yours faithfully, (Name of the parent who wants to complain)  

The team of Little Chefs are writing a letter to the parents of children who want to do the course, to explain why the course is fun for children. The team have included extracts of letters from other parents who want the course as well. The letter has six paragraphs, and uses simple language to convince the parents that the course is beneficial to the children:

Your children learn important life skills by developing their social and communication skills, and practicing the practical skills of cooking and eating. However, we also understand that you would like to see them spending time with their"," The children learn to choose the best ingredients, seasoning and preparing the dish. The best part of cooking is that it is very therapeutic for the body and soul. The children do so much good cooking with such care, such as creating delicious nutritious meals for their sick parents or helping their grandparents who live with Alzheimer’s. How does one get into cooking as a career? Cooking is relaxing and gives children a sense of belonging to a team working together on a special dish. It is a healthy hobby that is fun and a creative way to express love for food and family. Cooking also gives adults a chance to spend time with their children who really love it and learn new skills.

A child who is assessed at A1 level would know only simple sentence patterns and memorised phrases, would use explicit information and numerous information points in their text.  

These children are learning to be serious and good cooks. They are happy and are being taught good cooking skills and the importance of using good ingredients when cooking. The course is well worth the money. They are making good meals for their families and the food is tasty. It is so good they have a waiting list for the course. 

What happened? The course didn't go so well. The children were unhappy with the course and didn't enjoy it. The parents were unhappy with the course too and thought the courses were too expensive. The children who did go to the course did enjoy it but it is not clear if this made them assessed at A1 or A2 level. 

One idea to help assess at this level could be to compare how well a child knows simple sentence patterns and memorised phrases with how well they use explicit information and how much information points they use.

" She was on the balcony last night when we visited' said Craddock. Cornish nodded. 'Do you think it could have been one of them? We arrested Lola for assaulting Marina last night - it could be her that killed her' said Cornish. 'But why would she do that? She was defending Marina' said Craddock. 'Lola had a history of hitting Marina and told her to keep away from Ardwyck. But this time Marina fought back. I suspect Lola thought she had killed Marina and went to put her body in the freezer for evidence' said Cornish. 'But she had already frozen her, I saw her myself. Marina had a big smudge of something near her eye, but it hadn't frozen all the way' said Craddock. 'Perhaps Lola put something in her drink to make her aggressive? Marina said Lola had offered her a drink and it was quite a potent drink, but Marina didn't realise that until afterwards' said Cornish.


'You can quote me on that one' said Cornish.


'OK. But who could have killed her? Either Ardwyck or Lola didn't want her to testify against them' said Craddock. 'That leaves one other person' said Cornish. 'We will look at Marina's phone records and see who had the most communication with her on the night she was killed'


The two policemen"," She was on the telephone when Marina arrived. Ardwyck and Marina nodded a hello, they said their goodbyes, and then suddenly there was a gunshot. Marina collapsed. Lola rushed to her and found Ardwyck with a gunshot wound to the stomach. Lola said she saw a third person run away down the street.  Inspector Craddock said ""I'll bring him in alive or I'll bring him dead"" and asked if they could use his car to get to the hospital.' 

The first paragraph gives background information about the murder and what is known so far about the suspect. It also highlights what the suspects said to each other. In the second paragraph, the suspects decide what to do about the suspect they have in custody. The third paragraph then reports on the suspect and suspect's companion's actions after the murder.

'It would', replied Craddock, 'but I also thought the American's were interested in the murder, and might have had a reason to try to prevent it from being solved. So that could be a motive.'

'But if they didn't kill the host, who did?' said Cornish. 'The Barmans would be the obvious suspects.'

'They had a row with the Greggs after the party,' said Craddock. 'Mrs Bantry said Marina had a ""frozen look"" when she found her body, which could mean she'd been upset.'

'That would be consistent with what the Barmans told us,' said Cornish, 'that the Greggs had been drinking and having a row.'

'But they said Marina had a knife at the party',' pointed out Craddock. 'So if she'd been upset, she might have gone outside to get rid of the knife.'

'Which is what the Barmans said she'd done at the party. So either the Barmans lied, or they're the killer and the knife is a red herring.'

'But wouldn't it be suspicious if they were both in America and the murder hadn't yet been solved when they returned?'

" It was a young man lying on the bed with a woman beside him. She was smiling a warm welcome and then saw Virginia. She froze but the young man's hand slid under the blanket and cupped her breast.

Virginia stopped and stood stock-still. The man on the bed stirred and looked at the door. Then his hand left her breast and he sat up, pulled the blanket up around him.

'How did you get in here?' he demanded.

Virginia turned and walked away, almost running back to the stables. As she rode past the man had heard her and sat up, his hand on his stick as he reached for his trousers. He saw her and frowned but did not call after her.

Virginia rode back to the house but knocked again, waited, then tried the door and let herself in. She stood staring at the young man on the bed, looking more angry than afraid. The woman was standing there too, her hands on her hips.

'I saw you walking through the fields an hour ago,' the man said, 'and followed you. I wanted to talk to you.'

'About what?' asked the woman.

'About a bet I think I'm going to win.'

'Oh.' The woman turned to the young man. 'Perhaps you'd better go, before she comes back.'

The young man stood up, and then hesitated, looking at"," She stopped in the doorway and stared, her face lighting up with astonishment. 

“Who’s there?” she called out.

“It’s only me, Virginia. I couldn’t sleep and I came up to see if you had any money hidden.”

“Money!” exclaimed Virginia. “Oh, I wish I had some of your money.”

“You can’t have any money. You’re a poor orphan, adopted into an rich family.”

“Yes, but they’ll be very angry at me if I’m found with any money. It’s against the rules of rich families. And I do wish I had some of your money.”

“Well, I have only a few dollars,” said the youth.

“I have some savings from my poor aunt, and I will give you half of them if you will give me half of your money.”

The youth, whose name was Dick, gulped. Virginia guessed it was because he was nervous. But she was right. Rich families forbade their adopted children from having any money.

“All right, you can have half of my money,” said Dick.

Dick counted out fifty silver dollars from his pocket and gave them to Virginia. Then he went to his room. He put the money in the top of his wardrobe. Then he took down from the top shelf of his wardrobe a small red box, and,"," She froze, horrified, knowing what the consequences of a scandal might be for a young lady in her situation.  She was too afraid to go on. But the man in the room just looked back at her and smiled.  That moment changed Virginia's life and changed the lives of everyone who knew about it.  It wasn't until many years later that she told anyone about it.  Her family and friends still haven't quite accepted her as a normal person, and still often call her Virginia of Woodstock rather than Viscountess D'Abernon.  But she always knew that she would find love and happiness.  Her life after the scandal was one of great joy.  The man she had loved so much continued to love her too. He married her and they had two children.  She lived to the age of 82 and was still loving and caring. She was the life of the party.  People loved her and she loved everyone.  There was no one she wouldn't speak to, no subject off limits.  She died in 2015 and was greatly missed.  But her legacy lives on and can be found in the many children and grandchildren of her loving family, and in the lasting joy of so many people she touched.  Everyone was the better for her.

 Virginia D'Abernon is a fictional character in Winston Graham's space opera star system Deep Space Nine.  She is a member of the Kazon"," She stopped dead still, and then the man screamed with rage and ran out of the room. Virginia followed him to the room that had been locked, but the door was locked too, and so was the window. She went back to the kitchen, crying and upset. Her mother was working in the garden.

Virginia and her mother looked at each other and then at the garden, but they didn't say anything. The garden had been a source of much unhappiness in the family lately, with the death of the previous gardener and with all the weeds needing to be pulled up. And so they waited for the gardener to return. 
Virginia's mother started to talk to the gardener about the weeds, but then she suddenly stopped and started to cry. The gardener came back just then, and although he seemed surprised to see the state of the garden, he said nothing. He carried a large hoe in his hands and seemed to know exactly what he was about to do. He put down the hoe and pulled off his gardening hat. Virginia's mother asked if he had heard the screams that Virginia had heard, and the gardener nodded. He said he didn't like having bad stories in the house. He always liked to have a good story to tell in his old age, and so he would go into the shed and fetch the axe.

The gardener set about cleaning the weeds with the hoe and made no move to fetch"," She froze, but then when she heard the man snoring, she went in. The man on the bed was Mr Griffiths, the schoolmaster from the village. He awoke with a start and called out, 'Virginia! What are you doing here?' She stood very straight and answered, 'I thought you were asleep.' 'No, I was,' he replied. 'Well, what are you doing here?' she asked again. Then Mr Griffiths realised who it was and his face went scarlet and he mumbled, 'Oh, my God, it's Virginia Water. It is you, isn't it?' She nodded and said, 'Yes, it's me, Mr Griffiths.' 'Oh, I am so sorry, I didn't know you were still here,' he said, and stood up to leave. 'That's all right,' she said. Then she whispered, 'You did not say who you were.' Mr Griffiths turned back to look at her. 'Who I am? I am your schoolmaster, Mr Griffiths. But I am also...I...' He blushed even redder and mumbled something she could not hear. She smiled and nodded again, and said, 'Good, good. I am glad you're back.' She turned and left the room without another word.

Analysis
The story starts with Virginia telling her young admirer to go out riding in the fields. This is consistent with the CEFR description"," It was a man, but so old and so bent that she didn't recognize him. She stood staring at him as he walked up and down a few times and then went out into the garden. The old man came in, too, and she asked where he had come from, and he said that he had been to visit his grandson, and had brought a present for the young lady in the room. 

It turned out to be a very nice clock, and Virginia was very glad to have it. She thanked the old man and told him that he could go now, but he said he would stay awhile and have some ices. So he sat down on the arm of a chair in the room and said that he was from very far away, and that he had learned a lot of wonderful things about clocks and wanted to tell them to Virginia.

The old man began telling a very funny story about a certain clock that belonged to his grandson that was so old and so very, very out of tune that the minute hand moved backwards all the time. He went on to tell how his grandson had learned a secret that if the minute hand moved backwards at exactly 22.5 seconds, the big weight that keeps the clock running would drop down. This meant that the clock would stop for just a moment and the old man could slip away before the weight dropped and the clock stopped again. So the old man said he had come from very far away to tell this secret to Virginia."," She could not tell who it was because it was dark in the room, but she was terribly afraid. Virginia jumped off her horse and tiptoed into the room, but could see nothing because there was only a bit of a light coming through the half-open door. Then she heard a sound like a sob. She held her breath and listened carefully, but she could hear nothing but the sound of her own breathing. At last she thought she could make out a figure bent over, almost hidden in the shadow. She was trembling uncontrollably now. Virginia had never been so frightened in all her life, but she knew that there was nothing to be afraid of – she was looking at a friend of her aunt's, who was visiting for the summer. She waited a little longer, then went in and said 'who's there?' but received no reply. 'Who's there?', she asked again more sternly, but got no answer. Then she heard a laugh and the sound of steps – she could hear them coming closer. But the footsteps stopped. Then she heard a woman's voice say, 'it's me, Aunt Mina.'

" Don't wait for winter to be over just because you hate the cold. Instead, plan ahead, be aware of the conditions, and always drive defensively.


Ice: You have to be extra careful around ice patches because sometimes when the road freezes over and becomes slick, vehicles drive over it and go off the road.


Fog: Even though fog can be challenging to deal with, you still have to be mindful of your surroundings and pay attention to changing conditions. You might not see the fog because the thick air can block your view, but that doesn't mean it won't clear.


Snow: Finally, when it's snowing or hailing, you have to be extra careful. If you get stuck, you could be stranded for days. Take the proper precautions and drive defensively.


These are just some of the things you have to be aware of in the winter months. It's no picnic but if you plan ahead and are always driving defensively, you should have no trouble.


Winter is challenging and can be deadly, but you should try to find ways to make it more manageable. It's better to be safe than sorry, and if you want to survive, you have to be prepared. Winter is a learning experience, don't be afraid to get out there and see what it can offer. Remember, winter is just like the winter weather, but it can also be a time of growth and adventures. So be sure to"," Even when it's sunny it might rain, freezing rain that freezes on the road. Driving at wintertime might be very scary but with a little preparation you can enjoy the winter season safe in your car. A windshield washer reduces the visibility of the road by wipers but you can avoid this by keeping the defroster on high or by turning it off. It's best to avoid driving under heavy fog. Once the fog clears use a head-up display, so you can easily see the road without having to look down. When it's cold outside use extra layer of clothing and warm up your car with the defroster on high. You can also use a heating pack to warm up your car. It will be hard to drive but still possible. You can also use a snow brush on your car to remove snow and ice from the roads. If you have a heated car you can use an extra set of clothes and gloves to prevent from feeling cold. If you need a little help don't hesitate to call a friend or a service like Uber.

Learning objectives:

  * Drivers should be able to describe fog and ice.
  * Drivers should know to stay alert during winter driving seasons.
  * Drivers should be able to use heated cars to avoid driving in cold weather.
  * Drivers should know how to clean the windshield of snow and ice.
  * Drivers should be able to use an extra"," Snow blindness can be blinding. Driving in the winter is just hard.  Your tires might get slush or ice on them. There might not be enough visibility because the fog hasn't burned off yet or the snow has melted too much and turned to ice on the road. In that case, you might get stuck. It's hard to see the road in all kinds of conditions and dangerous too. So many accidents happen in the winter. You should be careful when driving in winter and try to plan ahead and drive less, or even drive with a car with snow chains if you can afford it. It's really important to plan ahead and take preventive measures. In the winter, you should drive slower and take more care of the driving and the conditions you are driving in. And try to use snow chains, or if you don't have them, at least put blankets under the snow tires, so you will have better traction. It's better to drive with a winter car with snow chains to drive in winter conditions. You should try not to drive in winter conditions because you might be in for a surprise when you are on the way. It's good to plan ahead and drive less. That way, you will be safer and avoid accidents when unexpected things happen. 

Use this story to help students gain a deeper understanding of: driving in winter conditions, taking care of driving in winter conditions, how planning ahead reduces driving risks and helps avoid surprises on the road.

Winter Driving"," It's always safer to go on the road instead of driving. Winter is best spent indoors watching a nice warm fire. 

The stories that learners can write about can include lessons they have learned about weather, and the precautions they take to be safe while driving or spending time indoors. For example, a learner could write about how dangerous it is to drive in winter due to the changing weather conditions, e.g. fog, rain, snow, ice.

"," Driving in winter requires extra care and caution, but if you take the time to plan your routes you can reduce the risk of getting lost and have a lower chance of an accident. The most important thing is to wear warm clothing and use navigation devices. Be careful driving in snowstorms and blizzards so that you can prevent getting stuck in snowdrifts and avalanches. Be extra cautious around hillclimbing because the road can be particularly steep and the gradient unpredictable. Use your vehicle lights at night so that you don't travel at high speed in the dark. Keep an eye out for speed bumps, which can be hidden in the snow. Use your vehicle headlights for the daytime so that you can see the road, but turn them off when it gets darker. Try to keep your vehicle interior at least 10 degrees Celsius, but keep the rear seats warmer so that you can keep dry clothes and other items in them. This can also help prevent you from getting too cold. 

Use the following passage to guide you through this topic.


Winter Driving Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow waiting to send you off the road. Driving in winter requires extra care and caution, but if you take the time to plan your routes you can reduce the risk of getting lost"," Inadequate winter driving laws can make driving in winter a dicey affair. In the UK, car drivers are only considered ""incapacitated"" by freezing temperatures or heavy snowfall. As an analogy, you could consider car driving in winter to be more like ice hockey than normal hockey. Ice hockey is difficult because you have no vision and there is a lot of danger involved due to the unpredictability of when the puck will be in front of your net, but you are not concerned about getting injured or losing a game due to poor playing. Ice hockey is considered to be easier than ice hockey. This is because there are more than just two teams, it is played on a large hockey field and a larger ice rink is available so there is more space for players to move about and dodge pucks. But, when ice hockey is compared to ice hockey, it is considered to be easier. Ice hockey is like car driving in winter: dangerous but not incapacitating.


Here is a passage from the text that is at Grade 2 level:  

She was trying to drive a car up the very steep hill, and the car fell down many times. She thought to herself, ""Why am I driving this car? It is dangerous, especially with all the snow that has fallen."" ""Inadequate winter driving laws,"" she thought, ""can make driving in winter a dicey affair."" In the UK, car drivers are only considered ""incapac"," If you are worried about driving in the Winter months, make sure you wear good winter driving clothes that protect you from the elements. You should put snow chains on your car, wear snow gear and take snow plows to your home so your car is protected and also can get through the snow safely. A car can be a dangerous thing to drive in the Winter especially if you have not had experience with the type of driving that Winter entails. Cars can be difficult to see when the fog is hanging in the air and the snow is falling slower than you can see it. Make sure that you take safety classes to be safe on the road and wear goggles to protect your eyes from the hazards of driving in the Winter.

Bo the cat - a small but active little cat - decided to explore a furniture van and found herself surrounded by exciting possibilities. 

She explored the van to find different places for her favorite hiding places. She explored the van's many compartments and doors and finally decided to hide in one of the many boxes. She curled up and fell asleep. 

She woke up when the driver started his drive. She didn't want to miss this new opportunity to see what the city had to offer. He started at a very fast pace and Bo quickly realized this is not an opportunity to get some rest. The cat leapt out of the van and ran after him. 

The driver was surprised by this and kept a slow pace while Bo ran up alongside him. 

Bo felt like the cat she is and chased the driver, who was unable to outpace her anymore. They both reached the end of the street and a nice park, where the driver finally stopped the van. Bo jumped out of the car and was very happy to return home.

" Emma could not bear the thought of any of them meeting Mr Elton. She sat in her room waiting for someone to come and chat to her. The day passed with no visitor and when evening came she could bear it no longer. She had to tell someone. The only other person she could think of was Jane Bates. She was a poor servant who did whatever she was told. She could easily be persuaded to talk to Emma if she were not so ignorant.

Emma went downstairs and found Jane Bates folding the kitchen chairs. 

""How do you do, Jane.""

""Oh, thank you, Miss.""

""It's cold out today and we have had snow but it is getting darker earlier so I thought you might like to come upstairs for a little chat.""

Jane followed Emma upstairs and they found Mr Knightley reading in the hall. 

""Ah, here you are, Jane. Jane, this is Miss Bates, she helps me with the house work.""

""How do you do, Miss Bates. It's a pleasure to meet you."" 

""Thank you.""

""I was wondering if you would like to come upstairs and talk to me for a little while. It is not comfortable to be left all by myself, you know.""

""Oh, Miss, I would love to.""

They went up to Emma's room and Jane took off her cloak.

""Please sit down,"," Emma was disappointed to see that he had not brought any gifts for Harriet and she was disappointed to learn that he did not know that she was married.

Emma was very sad and wondered how much Mrs Weston knew. She began to worry when no one came to call on Christmas Day and when they did come she said it was a surprise for her. Emma knew from Mrs Knightley that Mr Elton did not know so she thought that meant he did not know either. She decided to tell Mr Knightley the truth when he returned from London.

Emma loved going to church and had hoped to see Mr Elton or talk to Harriet. She wondered how much Mr Knightley knew about Mrs Elton and decided to ask Mr Knightley after they returned from church. As they were sitting down for breakfast, they heard a car drive into the yard and Mr Knightley went to see who it was. He returned just as Emma was taking her seat. He introduced her to his sister and her daughter.

Mr Elton shook hands with Mr Knightley and Emma wondered why Harriet was not there. Mr Knightley explained that she was not at church because she was married. Emma was shocked and went to see Harriet in her room. She was surprised to see a wedding dress hanging on the back of the door and Mr Knightley introduced her to Mr Elton. Mr Elton was very happy to meet her and said that he thought she looked even lo"," Emma was glad to be allowed to stay and write, as Mr Knightley was very kind and helpful. He took her out to lunch and told her about the time that he and Mr Elton were young and they travelled around the world together. They went to China, Borneo and Papua New Guinea and Mr Elton had even gone so far as to swim with orangutans. Mr Knightley had found this rather embarrassing and Mr Elton had promised to change into clothes more befitting a young man. The orangutans, though, had made fun of him and demanded to know where his money had gone. Mr Knightley was not keen to see what the orangutans would think of him when they saw his undergarments and his trousers. The orangutans, though, insisted, and Mr Elton was forced to take off his trousers and underwear and climb into a tree. Mr Knightley was so embarrassed that he left right away, without having lunch. He was very angry and said that the orangutans were no longer a matter of shame to him. Mr Elton was very angry too and wanted to take revenge on the orangutans. They should go to Japan, and see if the samurai could take on the orangutans. The orangutans, however, were laughing at Mr Elton and said that the samurai were too soft for their liking. The orangutans then took Mr El"," Emma thought he seemed strange as he arrived just after lunch on Christmas Day and did not say anything about coming. Mrs Smith also seemed a bit strange. Mrs Knightley had asked them to put up the tree early. They said they would. Emma was surprised to see Mr Knightley open the trunk of the car and start taking down the tree himself. She asked Mrs Knightley about it, but Mrs Knightley did not answer the question. The next day, when Mr Knightley came to breakfast, Emma asked him about the tree and why he had taken it down. Mr Knightley laughed and said, “The tree is never going to be tall enough for you two, and I told Mrs Knightley we would get the supplies for the next night’s party from the garage.” Emma felt embarrassed but Mr Knightley added, “We are going to have a jolly good time this Christmas and I thought you might like to come along.” Emma smiled, “Well now that would be a jolly good time.” The next evening, after dinner, Emma saw Mrs Knightley come into the sitting room and tell Mr Knightley they were going out for a walk. Emma followed them to the garage and saw Mr Knightley getting out of the car and into the snow and wind. Emma asked Mrs Knightley what they were going out for a walk in the snow. Mrs Knightley turned to her and said, “We are going to look at our new properties.” Emma said she had never heard"," 

Mr Knightley, a country man himself, had heard a lot about Emma from Lady Catherine, who always encouraged him to take an interest in her husband’s family and social circle. Mr Knightley was happy to help but knew little about them or the social climate of the time. He was surprised when Emma asked him to come to Hartfield for lunch. He was even more surprised to discover that the family were still there after Christmas and Mr Knightley was able to spend a lot of time with them.

He was especially interested in the social climate and how things were changing in London. Lady Catherine informed him that Emma’s family lived in a nice part of town and they were able to maintain a fairly strict social life. Mr Knightley was amazed that Emma’s family did not go out to the parties that Lady Catherine’s friends kept inviting them to. Emma was also surprised that Lady Catherine did not spend more time with them and that Lady Catherine seemed to spend less time with her family.

In the end, Mr Knightley was the one to go back to London and found that Lady Catherine had indeed become so absorbed in her work that she no longer had enough time for her family. Mr Knightley was heartbroken and returned home to Hartfield empty handed, but he knew he would find Emma with a full plate and a bottle of Champagne waiting for him.


In the new, modern world, Emma's family has to maintain a more flexible"," Emma felt sad that Harriet was not able to visit during Christmas because Emma felt bad when people did not come to visit and she did not know why. Harriet always came to see her on Christmas Day.

A2 is the lowest classification in the CEFR scale, designed for learners in grade 2 or 3 who have limited experience of reading. The CEFR scale can be a useful tool for comparing language standards around the world.

A2 material is generally able to be understood by A2 learners. The vocabulary and sentence patterns are limited to very basic structures using memorised phrases, explicit information and limited number of information points.

Learning to read and write in A2 is not difficult but requires the learner to be comfortable in basic sentence patterns with explicit information and a limited number of information points. A2 material generally follows the three-dimensional or ABC pattern: the subject comes first, the verb comes next and the object comes last. The use of main, direct or indirect is used to show the relationships between words in a sentence.

The children will be able to identify the paintings in 16) and 15) as paintings of lions and the baby in 14) as being born. The paintings in 15) and 16) are not lions. However they are paintings of lions. Lions normally live in the wild and are not commonly found in gardens or in trees. They are however, sometimes seen in captivity and are often in zoos and other wildlife centres, as part of exhibits. A surprising fact about lions in a garden is that around 20 lions can often be found living together in a pride. This is especially the case if the garden has a strong tree element. In the paintings in 15) and 16), the lions can be seen by their tails. Tails are the lions main indicators of their species.

The Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) is a public university in Dublin, Ireland, specialising in digital, engineering and creative industries. They have over 25,000 students, over 400 staff and 15 businesses in their foundation as a result of their partnership with Google. DIT currently has several activities and events that are"," Each correct answer will award points. The points will be tallied at the end of the Easter holidays and the top three children will win prizes. In addition to the painting-based questions there are a couple of reading comprehension questions. To help read the text, the gallery has provided a glossary at the end of the gallery newsletter.

A few notes about the quiz: 

The quiz is meant to be taken by young children. 

Due to the age of the children, this quiz might be easier for children who are familiar with painting techniques than reading techniques. 

The paintings that can be found during the Easter holidays may be more exciting than ones that can be found at other times of the year.

The reading comprehension questions come in handy when reading the text.


Gallery News Easter quiz for children The free quiz sheets can be picked up from the desk at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be directed to 14 surprising paintings and asked a variety of questions about them. Each correct answer will award points. The points will be tallied at the end of the Easter holidays and the top three children will win prizes. In addition to the painting-based questions there are a couple of reading comprehension questions. To help read the text, the gallery has provided a glossary at the end of the gallery newsletter.

There is a glossary at the end of the gallery newsletter which contains useful definitions and phrases for the reading activities. The glossary is listed below"," The first 3 children that complete the quiz will win a prize!  

In the last quiz in the series, children were asked which animal was present in one of the paintings. They chose dinosaurs. One of the dinosaurs shown is a T-Rex. The T-Rex is a dinosaur that is known for its large size and powerful head movements. Its teeth are specialized for tearing meat apart. It is also an important dinosaur in the works of the famous paleontologist Sir Richard Owen.  

While the dinosaurs may be surprising, it's the birds that are truly the highlight. The paintings show a diverse selection of birds including hummingbirds, toucans, storks, swans and stilts. It would be difficult to find two birds that are more different than that! Yet, the birds all belong to the same family - Aves. This is why the Aves quiz from last week asked you to compare and contrast the features of birds. 

In the last Aves question, you were asked to choose the one bird that has features both different and similar to toucans. It is the Red-tailed hawk.  

Although both toucans and storks are known for using their tails as wings to glide through the air, they do so in very different ways. Toucans use their tails as primary means of flight, whereas storks use their tails only for balance. In addition, toucans have a"

There once was a school called Greenfield Academy. The head teacher was Miss Gwen Cooper. Gwen was a kind and gentle woman who had much to do with getting the school running smoothly. One day a rumour started that Miss Cooper was going to sell Greenfield Academy. No one knew where it had come from or who was spreading the rumour, but no one wanted to be the one to contradict the story so it was whispered again and again until it had taken root. 
  
The children were naturally worried about their future at Greenfield Academy and the worst of it was that they were not even sure Miss Cooper knew the truth of the rumour! The children searched in their heads and asked Miss Cooper a million questions, but none of them could ever get her to admit that the rumour was wrong. 
  
Finally one day Miss Cooper stood up in assembly and said ""I can see that this rumour has made our students unhappy and I'm sorry for that. However it is not only not true, it could even be a lie! I'm going to go and look it up in the Greenfield Academy Handbook. If I am right then this rumour will prove to be wrong.""
  
The children breathed a sigh of relief and Miss Cooper went straight to her desk, pulled out the Greenfield Academy Handbook and started to look up the answer to the rumour. 
  
As she worked she could see the worry leave the faces of"," It should be between 5,000 and 8,000 words. Stories will be judged on characterisation, narrative, plot, pace and setting. The Prize for the best story in the A2 section is a £1000 cheque. So write a story that's worth £1000!

One day I was in the garden and I saw my father sitting on the bench just inside the gate. I ran over to him and he was crying. I was shocked.  
""Come here little one"" he whispered. I walked up and sat down next to him. He stroked my hair and whispered ""it will all be all right"".

I’m not sure if this is a good idea. The website does say that it is for fiction, and my novel is non-fiction. Not sure if this would be okay!

Hi Claire, we’ll need to see the novel to be sure, but it sounds like a great idea!

I wanted to respond to your question now. Fiction and non-fiction novels can be adapted. There is a fiction award that is open to non-fiction novels.

If it’s for the Fiction Prize, then you might want to check with the judges before sending in your novel as they have other novels to consider for the prize.

Hi Claire, I don't see a problem with adapting your book into a fiction novel. It would need to be edited for technical elements like character development and plot, but not necessarily rewritten.

What is keeping you awake at night?  (minimum 3 lines)
While working as a teacher I can admit that my nightly worry is if the kids are going to have enough to eat. My students are from low income families and often their mother is not employed and so they will not have much money to spend on food. I try to buy enough food for the week at least and also go around to the local foodbank once a week. Unfortunately, I can also admit that many of the children also have medical conditions that make them more susceptible to malnutrition - this makes the situation even harder.

" The band say they are still ‘the same Moonshine you know and love…’ but there’s a difference. They now sound more focused and it’s noticeable on their latest CD. 

Moonshine are a great band to listen to if you like alternative rock.  They have a nice sound and they also have a nice set of musicians who play and play and play. They also have lyrics that relate to life as an alternative rock fan.  They describe life as ‘interesting’ which is a nice way to look at life. 

There are 3 songs on the CD you can listen to here on YouTube. They are: 

- “Keep On” – this song is a nice intro for the CD and has a nice jammy feel.
- “Birds Singing” – this song has a nice chorus and nice keyboards in the middle with a nice bass and drums. The last minute of this song is a nice bridge for the CD. 

- “Here Again” – the first song on the CD is another nice song, though the vocals are a little too high throughout this song. The rest of the song has a nice rhythm, nice keyboards and bass drums.  

If you want a great CD from an alternative rock band with a nice set of musicians then this is a CD you should check out. 

Do you like Moonshine’s latest CD? Are there any changes you notice on the"," The CD is available from online retailers or from www.moonshineband.co.uk.

  The story should begin with a brief description of the band and their history, then go on to describe how the CD ‘Here again’ was released, who is featured on it and their contributions. Finally, you should conclude by highlighting some of the band’s achievements so far.

  Moonshine are a new band on the scene, formed a few years ago in Leeds. Their sound is an amalgamation of blues, rock, Americana, punk and country. They have recently released a CD titled ‘Here again’, and it includes contributions from a number of guest performers.

  Their influences are evident on their debut CD, ‘The Waves’. The songwriting is very powerful, with clear, honest lyrics and arrangements. The rhythm section of Tom Wilcott on bass and Simon McVee on guitar provide a solid foundation for the songwriting, and they complement each other extremely well.

  The arrival of Tom Simpson on drums adds a whole new dimension to the band, and is clearly an asset to the music they create. His energy and enthusiasm help drive the band, and complement the vocals of front woman Daisy D’Arcy.

  Moonshine have enjoyed growing popularity over the last year, and their ‘Here again’ CD continues this momentum. It is a well-crafted recording, and there is a lot of diversity to their"," 

The band continue to play the music of their influences from the late 70’s. A large influence on the sound of the band was the progressive rock band Yes whose members had also contributed to projects of both Wilcott and Greg Howe of Yes. Singer Ian Anderson also encouraged the band to write their own material and this was another key influence in the sound of the band.

This CD was produced by Guy Chambers and also features artwork by Jim Tiller, who also designed the album artwork for ‘The Waves’.

Moonshine continue to tour the music festivals and are looking to record a new album in the near future. 

CD Review: The Waves 

The Waves is the most recent album from British progressive rock band Moonshine. 

Moonshine continue to write their own material and have had a few changes to the line-up from the last CD. Simon McVee, left the band last year and was replaced by Tom Wilcott on bass guitar. Greg Howe of Yes, was also involved in the recording of the CD, playing drums and co-producing it. 

The album is available to purchase from their official website: https://moonshineband.com/.

The Waves continues their signature sound of progressive rock from yes-era band, with some guest musicians including Chris Farlowe. The album is a follow up to The Waves and continues the band’s exploration of"," Moonshine play a mix of classic and contemporary country / western material and they have created a CD that will please many fans and newcomers to their sound.
Moonshine, ‘Here again’


Moonshine are a US country / western band from Texas. The band have released 3 albums so far. Their latest album ‘Here again’ is set for release on 30th July 2015 on the indie label ‘Big Dada’.


The band formed in 2013, and are made up of founding member Tom Wilcott on bass guitar and lead vocals, as well as Tom Simpson on drums.


While the band play a mix of classic and contemporary country / western material, it would appear that most of their latest album was written and recorded by Tom Simpson alone, with Wilcott only contributing lead guitar on one track.


The band have added a few modern touches to their sound on this latest CD, and there are a couple of instrumentals which could be of interest to fans of artists such as George Strait or Florida Georgia Line.


But the biggest difference is in the number of fans they have created for themselves on the CD, as this is their 3rd release.


Moonshine also have an active touring schedule and have appeared at several music festivals in recent years, often in the same line up with rising stars such as Jason Aldean, Chris Young, and Lady Antebellum.


The band are very proud"," Moonshine are currently based in London and have played a mixture of indie and stadium tours. The band play their own brand of synth-pop which many might describe as ‘80s pop with a modern twist.


Tom Simpson on drums: “Moonshine are a really great band and we all learn a lot from our experiences. We try to play our own brand of synth-pop which maybe ‘80s pop with a modern twist. When we started out we were all learning bass guitar and the leader Simon McVee left last year. Tom Wilcott stepped in on bass guitar to take on the role of lead guitarist. We all love the music and wanted to make it as good as we could and also make it our own. Simon’s drumming style was more like a jazz feel to it, and we didn’t want to go too hard into the techno direction. We listened to a lot of music that inspired us and that we thought was cool. We also listen to what our customers tell us in terms of what they want and need and that was an important factor in us wanting to go in a different direction on this record. The sound for us is very 80s but we’re not pushing it too hard, and just a bit of modern edge to it. When we started out we were playing small pubs where the sound system was in the floor, now we are playing arenas with sound systems in the ceiling. That is a"," This has freed up some rhythm guitar as Simon Pryor stepped down from the band. The songs on this album are driven by Tom’s powerful vocals but also the incredible bass guitar and drumming and the strong interplay between the band members. Moonshine are definitely ‘another name’ to watch out for! 

Moonshine has a following of die hard fans who have supported the band for decades. The album has created excitement among fans of the blues rock genre which has been lacking for a few years. This is evident from the long queues at record stores on release day. The music is ‘upbeat’ but also has the depth to pull the listener in and engage them fully. The lyrics reflect the struggles of love in the era of digital communication and the growing divide between artists and their fans.


Moonshine The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ‘Here again’ is a followup to ‘The Waves’. There have been a few changes since the last CD with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums. This has freed up some rhythm guitar as Simon Pryor stepped down from the band. The songs on this album are driven by Tom’s powerful vocals but also the incredible bass guitar and drumming and the strong interplay between the band members. Moonshine are definitely ‘another name’ to watch out for!"," The new CD is a ‘best of’ with two of the band’s most popular tracks ‘Love Is A Battlefield’ and ‘Here Again’. 

The band have a growing following in the US, UK and Ireland. They are due to record their fourth CD here in the next few months. 

The band members are themselves fans of the band, hence their success.

One day Hypatia was studying philosophy in a cathedral. She was wearing a beautiful silk robe and she was seated upon a richly decorated throne. She was quite alone in the cathedral. She was not concerned, for she often taught alone. Suddenly the doors of the cathedral flew open and six eunuchs entered and surrounded Hypatia. They bound her hands and feet. 

Upon her father's request, Hypatia's bound and defenseless body was brought before the Senate of Alexandria.  The eunuchs led her before the assembly of senators and held a mock trial. 

Hypatia defended herself eloquently, using the Scriptures, poetry, and rhetoric to prove that she was not breaking any laws. The senators were impressed, and Hypatia was set free. 

Soon afterwards she published her ideas about the physical world, astronomy, and mathematics. This caused great controversy as she disagreed with the traditional teachings of the day. This conflict brought more attention to Hypatia and she was soon invited to teach and to lecture at a number of learned universities throughout the Mediterranean world. In some places she was even allowed to teach and demonstrate her mathematical and scientific discoveries. 

Hypatia's fame eventually reached the attention of a Roman Prefect. He invited her to Rome where Hypatia was awarded a professorship at the Roman University of Constantinople and became the first woman scientist to have her works read in the Roman Senate. This,"," She excelled at school and studied Mathematics and Philosophy and became well-known in the academic community. When her father discovered her passion for philosophy and mathematics he was amazed and gave her freedom to pursue her interest. She was so good at her studies that she was granted an audience with the Roman emperor and was allowed to teach classes in the school she attended. When her father learned of this he tried to force her to give up her interest but she refused. Later in life she was put to death for being a 'blasphemous' woman who claimed that she could teach what was 'holy'.  Many in the history books' still remember her story and it is a testament to her courage and conviction that she was able to pursue a field that was considered as unskillable for a woman. Even with her lack of opportunity in life, her parents still supported and encouraged her.  Her story should be a testament to the power of perseverance and following one's passion. It is even more amazing given the societal norms and the discrimination that women faced then.


Hypatia was born in 370 A.D. and had an unusual background as the only woman in her field in the history books. How did she accomplish so much despite having limited opportunities in life?  Her father was able to facilitate her access to academics and allowed her to teach classes even though he disliked her field.  She was well-known in her field, and even the Roman emperor was"," Despite this Hypatia managed to study mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. In 356 A.D. she became the first woman ordained as a teacher in the Church of Alexandria. Over the next few years Hypatia's work gained her attention and respect from many people. Sadly, around 359 A.D. she was forced to commit suicide.  Her funeral was a riot where many people came out to express their respect for her.  After her death her reputation grew and she was eventually recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church.

Hypatia became the leader of a religious movement called Neo-Platonism and her teachings caused tension between her and the city authorities. The authorities finally arrested her and had her burned"," After completing her schooling Hypatia began studying mathematics and philosophy. She was determined to be an equal to any man, and she proved this to be true in her work. She started her own school and set up courses in astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy. Her reputation grew, and she was called in by the Roman emperor to teach astronomy. Unfortunately this didn't last long as she was accused of heresy for questioning the teaching of Greek philosophy in a public school. She was burnt at the stake and became a martyr to the cause of women's right to study. Her school was also destroyed, but she was able to rebuild it. She continued to teach and study astronomy, becoming a Professor of Astronomy at the University of Alexandria. In her studies Hypatia made many significant discoveries that proved the credibility of the Greek philosophers. She proved the Earth was round, that it moved around the sun, and that it was created by an intelligent creator. Even more significantly she was able to show women were equal to men, and that there was no place for bias in learning. She was a pioneer in the fight for equal opportunities for women. Hypatia's story is an inspiration to women everywhere.

The family was so worried about Hypatia that they took her education for granted.

When she was 18 years old, a bishop came to Hypatia and accused her of heresy. He told her she had to stop her research or face imprisonment. She refused and he had her thrown in jail. A mob then came and forced the bishop to leave the city. The mob stormed the jail and freed Hypatia. She quickly wrote a series of books denouncing the bishop's heresy. This made the mob even more angry and they went to the bishop's house and burned it down. The bishop had to start again. But this didn't stop Hypatia's research, and she continued to write books denouncing the bishop and his heresy. The books were soon banned and Hypatia's reputation grew. This was because she was a woman and she had an education, so the people of Alexandria respected her. It wasn't long before another church leader, who opposed Hypatia, challenged her to a debate. At the time, women had little chance to debate so Hypatia trained all night long in order to debate the bishop the next day. She won the debate and became the leading Christian theologian of her day. Over the next few decades, Hypatia's influence spread"," 
At the age of twelve, Hypatia began to teach mathematics at the university. 
But it was not long before she shocked the world by declaring that females were as capable as males in all disciplines. 
At the age of twenty-five she won a highly regarded academic scholarship in Athens to continue her research. 
But it was not long before she shocked the world once again when she published her works proving that females were as capable as males in all disciplines.
At the age of forty she returned to Alexandria to resume her teaching duties at the university where she had begun her career. 
Her career was short though as she died in 388 AD aged only forty-nine.

"

The rest of the class was all male and I was glad they weren’t all staring at my pink tutu (it was a gift from my mother). I stood at the back of the class as all the men danced. I watched them twirl and glide across the stage and it was as if I was watching a different world. They were so beautiful and had that special something that made them seem magical. Then they would stop and we would all sing along and clap.

After the class there was an after-party in the studio of the ballet school and it was here that I felt so much at home. There was vodka in cups and I had my own song which I would lead along to the music and sing in Russian. I danced and twirled my pink tutu. I cried when one of the male students brought his dancing partner back from the dance floor in tears. I smiled when a female member of staff danced by. 

Then the moment I have waited for finally arrived. The dancers came out of the wings and walked quietly onto the stage. I stood up and saw my name on the program and my name on everyone’s lips. The applause was overwhelming and everyone was congratulating me. Then the music started and I was thrown out into the wild. I found my feet and the audience were on their feet, clapping and singing along. I did my best to dance with the rest of the cast and I finally felt like I"," The feeling I had when I left my first ballet class though was one of complete happiness. I was so happy to be a part of a team working towards achieving a shared goal of creating beautiful music. 

The Kirov Ballet is the oldest ballet company in the world and was formed in 1870. The company has a long and illustrious history of creating iconic and beautiful dance performances that continue to inspire audiences to this day. In recent years the Kirov Ballet has expanded their ballet classes to welcome younger children to take part in the art of ballet. There was a group of us in our class who were younger and had no previous ballet experience. We were a diverse group of people from many different countries. I felt so happy when I first arrived in the class, everyone was so welcoming. I felt like I could really make new friends. The best part was when everyone began speaking English, it meant that we could communicate and enjoy the learning process together. I’m learning so much from ballet and can’t wait to go onto my next class.

## Special thank you"," I arrived at class in a taxi and was the only foreign student inside the ballet school.
My new class teacher was Svetlana and she was so kind and helpful. We practiced our steps and worked on our basics such as my left leg, position, leaping and so on. 

Svetlana has promised me that she will make friends for me and we will all go to the after class snacks together. Svetlana and I quickly hit it off and started chatting. She is so lovely and is from Ukraine. We talked about our families, our countries, cultures and how we felt about living in Russia. 

Before we knew it we were swapping addresses and phone numbers. She has since sent me a photo of her and her mum to prove it! Our time together was so enjoyable and I’ve felt very welcomed. 

Svetlana and I now regularly speak English and Russian. Svetlana taught me how to say hello in Russian.  Even though it’s not my first language I’ve picked up the rules surprisingly quickly.

Svetlana has also taught me all about Russia and its culture. I feel so welcome and now know that there are so many beautiful places to visit in the country.  The weather is good for visiting and walking too. 

The Kirov Ballet continues to be one of the most prestigious ballet schools in the world. I am so happy that Svetl"," The teachers were so happy to meet a young student from Australia. We were trained to say our classes were amazing. After my first lesson I knew I wanted to spend my life as a ballerina.

Kirov Ballet School was established in 1720. The school now has three opera houses, over 200 ballet and modern dance studios, six museums and a library with 500,000 books.

Answer: Nathalie is 16 years old, lives in London and joined the Kirov Ballet School in St Petersburg.  She is one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school and was nervous her first ballet class.  She was unable to communicate with her peers because everyone spoke Russian at her first ballet class.  She joined the company Diana and has since been able to follow many of the steps in the ballet.


Ballet shoes come in many different styles and each dancer must wear the correct type of shoe that matches the particular style of ballet they perform.  Styles of ballet shoes include pointe shoes, tutus and stage shoes.  Pointe shoes are an essential part of classical ballet as they provide the dancer with the ability to perform their dance steps barefoot on the ballet floor.  Ballet shoes are extremely protective as they are designed to withstand the shock of a dancer striking the ground with each foot.


There are three main styles of pointe shoes: Pointing Heel, Pointing Toe,"," However, I soon picked up the dance moves and became friends with my classmates, all of whom are from the UK.

The class was very different to the ones I was used to. As a British ballet student I was used to classes with lots of room to move and learn. Here, we had to move with the entire ballet and perform a new variation. As the class progressed, the Russian teachers gave the students more and more to copy, and I slowly began to copy wrong combinations. 

I wasn’t the only one struggling. Some of the students were much younger than me, and hadn’t learnt English in their previous ballet school, so they couldn’t understand our conversations. It was so disorientating. I kept looking around at all the people I didn’t know, wondering where I should look when I needed to do something, and then hearing another student’s footfalls behind me and suddenly wondering where they were. 

I felt like I was on a one-way trip to nowhere. My ballet school teacher tried to help me by giving me a speech in English, but my limited knowledge of the language made me feel frustrated and unable to understand what she was saying. 

At that point I decided that I had had enough, and refused to dance for the rest of the class. I started to panic and looked around for help, but the teachers were already yelling and forcing the students back into place, so I just picked up my things and left.

" By the end of the 17th century it was one of the most significant cities in Europe, second only to London. In the 18th century it became Europe’s biggest textile manufacturing centre and played a major role in the Industrial Revolution. However, at the beginning of the 20th century, its reputation as the centre of British textile manufacturing was finally eclipsed by that of nearby Nottingham. Today Norwich is known throughout Britain as the birthplace of British gastronomy and, to a lesser extent, of British culture itself. 

Norwich is situated at the confluence of three rivers – the Wensum, the Yare and the Causeway. Its geography, and the way in which the rivers meet has played a key part in Norwich’s development. The Wensum is the city’s main river, flowing southwest from Suffolk before entering the North Sea at Great Yarmouth. To the northeast of the city stands the岳land of Upland, a plateau which provides a natural catchment for the River Yare, which flows northwards into the North Sea at Lowestoft. To the south of the city lies the plains of East Anglia, which form the low-lying bed of an ocean that existed at the end of the Ice Age. 

The confluence of the three rivers provided the ideal foundation for Norwich’s early development. For millennia it was a ford where the Wensum and Yare joined, ensuring"," After the dissolution of the Monasteries, it continued to prosper under the patronage of the Kings of England who built a palace in the Market Place. In the 16th Century, it grew further due to the accession to the throne of two of England's most famous Queens, Elizabeth of York (the wife of King Edward IV) and Elizabeth of Richmond (the wife of King Charles II). As a result, Norwich became an important Royalinate Town through the 18th Century and remained so until 1851 when it was made a County in its own right. Today the city is best known for being the home of the University of East Anglia, a multicultural research and teaching facility. The East Anglia Science Park is based in the city, whilst the headquarters of IT company PTC are also located here.

Norwich is of Saxon and Norman heritage. Historically, the city was known as New Eden and was the site of the Battle of Battle of Branodwell in 1076 where Edward the Confessor was taken prisoner and William of York was killed. 
After the dissolution of the monasteries the city developed as a centre for trade with Europe. Today it is the largest city in the East of England and is known for its museums, award winning independent bookshop and many bars and restaurants.

You can use the following text to write your story:

The old city of Norwich, near the river Wensum, has existed as a","  As a result of its strategic position it soon became an important port and centre of trade.  This continued during the Anglo-Saxon period. The first mention of a bishop of Norwich can be found on 5 April 1093.  Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s Norwich became less important as a port due to competition from modern ports like London, Plymouth and Dover. However, it was re-established as a port after the Industrial Revolution and today continues to play a very important part in East Anglia's economy.  As a result it has grown in size with the population increasing from around 20,000 in 1861 to around 170,000 in 2001. The old city centre is now split into two parts. The more modern part to the west of the river Wensum is often referred to as ""The Fens"" and is home to approximately 75,000 people. To the east of the river is the old city centre. This is where approximately 115,000 people are based.

Throughout its long history Norwich has changed considerably. One distinctive aspect of the old city center is the number of its narrow winding streets and alleys known as ""chesneaux"". These are so named as they were originally only one story in height, however during the 16th and 17th centuries many became two or even three stories.

During the First World War, it was heavily damaged by artillery fire and then almost completely destroyed in a strategic bombing attack by the Luftwaffe. Since the 1950s, it has undergone extensive redevelopment, most notably with the construction of the Millennium Bridge and a massive expansion of the East Anglia Convention Centre. Today, it is known for its many universities and colleges as well as hosting the annual Euro 2008 football championships.


The prompt describes Norwich very briefly, and uses the terms ""Great Britain"" and ""Europe"". This gives you leeway to use different terminology, although it's probably best to stick to British English as described in the UK government's glossary of terms.  To write a story about Norwich, consider the following:

Norwich has existed for two thousand years. It was once a small village, but today it is a major city in England.  It has grown and become the second-largest city in the United Kingdom since 1820. It hosts many universities and colleges, and is a popular place to live.  During World War I, it was heavily damaged by artillery fire and nearly completely destroyed in a strategic bombing attack by the Luftwaffe. Since the 1950s, it has undergone extensive redevelopment, including the construction of a bridge called the Millennium Bridge and a major expansion of its East Anglia"," During the middle ages it became the site of the main cathedral for the Church of England. Today it is a vibrant modern city with many historic buildings and well-preserved medieval features.   

Norwich Today, Norwich is a vibrant modern city with many historic buildings and well-preserved medieval features. Its central place on the river Wensum and the fact it has always been part of East Anglia, have contributed to it being the country’s third largest city. Norwich is well known for its castle, which dominates the city skyline. Its covered market has occupied the same site since the 1400s. It has been designated a European City of Culture in 2021. It has an annual carnival and a rich musical culture, including jazz and swing music, and a thriving theatre and arts scene. Norwich is the home of the Norfolk and Norwich Tremonton, the only American Idol outside of the United States.

To write a story using this prompt that is usable by A2 learners, you"," Over the centuries it has changed hands a number of times and has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. Today, it is the home to around half a million people, who live across a range of different districts. 

There are several famous landmarks in Norwich. Its most famous building is the Norwich Cathedral, which was completed in a very unusual octagonal shape. It was designed and built between 1195 and 1240 by the French mason-architect Guillaume de L'Obel. Within the octagonal plan, there are six rounded aisles on each level, surrounded by a four-tiered presbytery. The cathedral is one of the great architectural wonders of the world. 

The cathedral is a symbol of the city and is frequently depicted in its modern crest. In 1228 the first charter was issued for the city by King Henry III, and since then Norwich has grown to become one of the largest cities in England, with over twenty-five thousand people living within its confines. It is the county town of the East Anglian district and the administrative centre for the neighbouring district of Anglian. The city is situated in the south west of England and is around fifty miles east of London. 

The city remains a focal point for the Eastern Midlands, a region that encompasses parts of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk in England. The main road through Norwich, the A47, was the first four-laned"," During the 16th and 17th centuries it suffered major upheavals from the dissolution of the monasteries and the collapse of the woollen industry. At the end of the 18th century, however, it experienced a period of prosperity when manufacturing began to take hold. Norwich is now the largest city in the United Kingdom's East Midlands region, and is considered one of the country's most picturesque. It is home to the University of East Anglia and over twenty conservation districts, many of which are listed buildings. Its best known landmark is Norwich Castle, a vast 13th-century castle.

During World War II, Norwich suffered greatly from bombing and fire. Over half a million tonnes of rubble from the city centre were removed from the streets and used to create new roads and public parks. The city has since rebuilt itself in a more modern fashion, and now has one of the best public transport systems in England. A large percentage of the city centre remains undeveloped, and there is still a decline in the city's woollen industries.  Many of the conservation districts have been demolished or are in the process of being demolished as part of a process of redevelopment. 

Today Norwich enjoys a high ranking in the world for its heritage conservation and architecture, and is regularly included in surveys of the cleanest cities in the world. In 2016, Norwich was ranked as the fifth cleanest city in the world. It is a UN"
" However, there are also some special protections that protect sharks. They are the only living creatures that are protected by six senses. They have the eyesight of dolphins, the taste of whales, the smell of dogs, and they can hear like bats. Sharks also have great intelligence. They can remember and follow patterns and can even teach their babies how to hunt and feed on their own. When it comes to fighting, they are very fast. Sharks can reach speeds of 55 mph and can also change directions quickly. Even though they are very fast, they have many weaknesses. Their small size and simple bodies make it hard for them to defend against larger animals. They are also on the list of animals that can be killed by a human without any feelings or problems. Sharks are very smart and very dangerous animals. It is important to keep them as the only food sources for people. It is also important to try to learn more about them so that we can keep them as a resource but also not put them in danger.  Sharks have lived a long and dangerous history. They have been hunted for their valuable skin and meat. They have also been used for their valuable fins that were used in medicines and in Chinese and Roman times sharks were used as a form of execution. Today, sharks are often misunderstood and put into a lower category than other animals that we usually see on land. This is not true. Sharks are not mean or cruel. They are misunderstood for a reason"," Sharks are often found near coral reefs and can be very big in size.  The largest Great White Shark that has ever been caught was 27 metres long. Great Whites will eat anything from fish to larger whales and other sharks.  Despite being a very feared creature, it is very important that sharks are left alone because they play an important role in keeping our oceans healthy. Without sharks there wouldn't be enough prey for other fish to eat, so there would be a lack of food for people to eat and there would be a very dangerous increase in fish species that have evolved to avoid sharks like the Flasherfish. This in turn would damage the coral reefs that sharks live in.  Sharks should be left alone because they are part of our oceans and they keep them healthy!


The story should explain why it is important to leave sharks alone and how sharks are beneficial to the ocean in general.


A great example of a shark story is ""The Great White Shark"". This story can be found on page 19 of the Curriculum Guide.


An important thing to remember about sharks is that they are typically seen in schools which makes them even more dangerous! So, as well as leaving sharks alone to play an important role in keeping our oceans healthy, you should also be aware that it is dangerous to be in a crowd of sharks.

Sharks are also misunderstood  Many people think sharks are dangerous, because they can be. In fact, if people would stop killing sharks by fishing and shark finning, we would not have to worry about sharks at all. Sharks need our help to protect the ecosystem of the ocean. We need to learn to not be afraid of sharks and to care about the sharks that are killed for their meat. 
People think sharks are not ready for water until they are around four feet long. This is because the space in water where sharks can see and move around is shorter than four feet long. Most sharks can be over seven feet long. We need to be more careful about treating sharks like they are four feet long. 

Write a story about sharks that is both scary and meaningful to people.

There are many important stories about sharks that teach us to love these animals. 
For one, sharks eat fish that are important to our ocean ecosystems. Sharks also help control the populations of other animals in the sea by hunting and predating on the animals that eat other animals. Sharks are misunderstood because there is often fear around them due to human violence towards them, but they are not aggressive. In fact, many people who do not understand sharks treat them as if they are.","

They are known to attack and kill humans if they come into contact with them. Sharks also rely on their sense of smell and hearing, and also have special muscle fibers that let them change color to show the way they are feeling. Today we still don't fully understand how sharks avoid becoming prey for other sharks. Scientists think it has to do with other sharks  not detecting the specific smell or pattern of the shark they are used to eating. However, even if we can't smell them or see them, sharks are still very well prepared for the worst. They have special sensory organs on their heads to measure movement. They also have special bones in their heads and bodies that let them turn fast and can even see in the dark. There is even a gene in sharks calledichthyosis, that protects them from UV light, so even if sharks are not able to smell, they are still very well protected from the sun. Scientists are still studying sharks to understand how they live in our oceans and how they avoid getting eaten by other sharks.  Sharks eat many different kinds of sea creatures and are therefore vital for the food chain in the ocean. They have powerful jaws and can swallow very large amounts of food in a short amount of time. They have very powerful front teeth, which are used for tearing large pieces of food","

 Sharks  Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies.

Sharks can be found in every ocean in the world and have family structures that depend on their diet and habitat. Most sharks in the oceans are harmless to humans. The whale shark and the tiger shark are exceptions as they are both considered to be ""menace to human life"". Sharks are known for their high intelligence and they show signs of self awareness.

Sharks are not very smart but they do understand the fear that people in the water show them. They will try to find a way to avoid these people.

" When the hotel was built in 1965 no one had ever imagined that one day people would be able to visit the hotel and spend their winter nights in the ice. 

Your story could follow a similar structure to this:

Sweden is the land of summer, long, sandy beaches and tall, green mountains. But every spring the temperature dips down below zero and for six months the entire country gets stuck in a permanent winter hibernate. That's where the inhabitants of Jukkasjarvi live. The village is located in the Norwegian Lapland and winter temperatures can reach -40 degrees celsius, but 6000 holidaymakers still visit the ice hotel every year. 

One evening in 1965 a farmer by the name of Olof Mörklé, thought it would be a fun idea to build an ice hotel. The hotel opened its doors in 1974 and still exists today. Every winter the hotel becomes colder than an icebox and the hotel's inhabitants spend their time staying in the frozen rooms, eating, drinking and getting married. 

But it wasn't until 2009 when people started discovering the possibility of visiting the hotel and spending their winter nights there. The hotel is built with three main pillars: food, drinks and accommodations. The food is served in the kitchen and is rather basic - sandwiches, soup, sausages and coffee. The drinks include spirits, beer and wine and are served at the bar. The hotel has 70 rooms and 50 of them"," This extreme climate makes ice the material of choice and ice hotels are quite common in Sweden's cold regions. When this hotel first opened in 1972 guests could sit at the bar and choose between drinks served in glasses made of ice or in hard alcohol-filled Coca Cola cans. Nowadays however guests are still served drinks from these cans. 

One of the most interesting things about this hotel is that the ice used to create the rooms isn't actually made of ice: in fact the rooms are filled with sea water mixed with dry ice. Dry ice contains carbon dioxide which freezes when it contacts a surface and it has been used by the hotel to maintain the cold inside the rooms by maintaining a layer of ice on top of the sea water. The hotel owners say that this creates the illusion that you're actually staying in an ice hotel and this has actually led to many repeat visitors. 

The main criticism of this hotel is that the sea water eventually freezes and expands and damages the building. Luckily however the hotel owners has built an expansion tank in one of the rooms that guests can use in case of emergencies and has installed heaters in each room.


The Ice Hotel's architect Lars Holm says that ice has many advantages as a building material:

- Ice expands and contracts much more slowly than the materials people are used to living and working in and it thus is more stable
- It's much lighter than stone, for example, and it also helps the hotel owners reduce"," However in December 2013 the owners of the Ice Hotel were arrested and charged with fraud and tax evasion. It seems that in 2011 a company called ""VIP hotel"" bought the Ice Hotel, rented out rooms, but had no customers and no revenue.  The company then created a fake letter from a bank confirming payment for the hotel, but this money never actually materialized.   According to the court proceedings, ""VIP hotel"" was a fake name created by an employee of the CEO of the company which bought the Ice Hotel.   According to this employee it was her job to create this name and the bank letter for the hotel to appear real.   The CEO of the company said this was the first of many scandals that has plagued the company and that the CEO himself is being investigated for possible money laundering and tax evasion.   The hotel is said to have now been taken over by the bank which originally confirmed the payment,  so it seems the story is not yet over.

Sweden has a large area with mild winter conditions known as Lapland. The most northern town in Sweden is Kefarnarfod, which is located in Lapland.

In the winter, Jukkasjarvi is one of the most visited villages in Sweden. The hotel has 6 ice rooms, where you can stay for a couple of days during your winter break.


One of the most unusual aspects of the hotel is that it is made of ice. The rooms are insulated with a special type of ice and are heated by hot water pipes that run through the ice in each room. This makes it possible to heat the rooms, but without using any external energy source. As long as the hotel remains refrigerated, you can stay in the ice rooms for a couple of days.

They say it's worth it for the experience, but also because it's a little frozen corner of the world that visitors can experience. 
-40° C is considered to be -20° F in Sweden. This is why the hotel owner has to provide special snowsuits for guests. The hotel was opened in 2006, so it has been occupied since then.

However, the Spanish cinema community accepted the challenge, and cartoons soon had a wider audience than they had ever had before.

The cartoon can be made with the following materials:
- A large sheet of paper
- A pen
- A pair of scissors
- A ball of string
- A few coins
- Glue

"," That's why there is no longer an official list of the top 100 movies ever made but the number of viewers watching cartoons has grown dramatically since the 1980s. Cartoon films can be funny, scary or a mixture of both. There is a wide variety of artists and styles used including stop motion, hand drawn and CGI. The technology used in cartoons is more advanced now, such as 3D.

The following is a story about a cartoon film called ""Up"". The story is based on real events that happened during the production of ""Up"". 

""Up"" was released in 2004 and had a lot of positive reviews. It won 3 Oscars that year and was voted number 1 in the critics' poll at the Oscars. 

The story of ""Up"" follows a small team of people who make the movie. The team includes animator Don Bluth, writer Gary Rydstrom and actor Edward Asner. 

The film tells the story of a boy who discovers he is the longest living human alive. To make his life special, he decides to go up into the sky, where the sky is actually the world of the spirits.

In the ""up"", the characters are based on real people who contributed to the film. In the credits of the movie you can find their names. Some of them are: 

- Don Bluth, who is the main animator
- Gary Rydstrom, the writer
"," That's why it was so surprising when Warner Bros. released the film ""The Wind in the Willows"" into the cinema in 1976. The critics and the public were not fooled and were excited by ""The Wind in the Willows"". The success of this film gave new life to the ""cartoon movement"" and started a comeback of this art-form. Today, cartoons are found on TV, on mobile devices and in the internet. You can even create your own cartoons online. The genre ""cartoon film"" also includes computer generated animation, which is becoming more and more realistic and exciting. There are already several films with realistically animated characters. For example ""Big Hero 6"" is a very popular film about a robot who has to protect a small San Francisco, where all the humans are related by blood to the robot. It also includes other characters who are realistically animated. This genre of films is also called ""digital animation"" because the characters are created using computer graphics. Although not all people have access to computers, cartoons are still watched and enjoyed by people of all ages around the world.


Animated films are often more difficult to understand than their live-action counterparts. This is because the former often feature a very limited number of unique ideas that can be represented on the small screen. Consequently, these films can appear to feature a high number of clichés and ""one-offs."" This has led to the rise of the Flesch","  But in recent years, cartoons have returned to the cinema screens.
The most famous of these films, is the film “Toy Story”, made by Pixar. This film won many awards and went on to change the life of many adults who watched it.
This is a very interesting story about the film “Toy Story”, and how it returned to the cinema screens.


--

The film “Toy Story” was first released on the cinema screens in the year 1995. Pixar was founded in 1995, so it is very likely that this film was made by Pixar at that time.

In this film, the character “Toy Story” goes through different situations and has adventures, which makes it very interesting for adults as well as children. This is an excellent example of the way that animation changed cinema.

Although “Toy Story” was originally released for children, it quickly became very popular with adults. Pixar became famous for its films, and its new computer program that allowed the animation of different situations and characters meant that “Toy Story” became exciting for people of all ages.

The story starts with the main character “Toy Story” and all his friends being in the backyard, playing with balls. Then we see the camera pulling back to reveal the whole backyard and the entire neighborhood, all of which is visible on the screen.

The film continues with “Toy Story” going to the store"," Today you can find cartoons on TV, computer and smartphone. Kids are no longer watching them but adults are enjoying them and it is interesting to note that all cartoons for adults today were first made for children.

As you can see from the example, the number of words, sentences and syllables are all used as part of the Grade Level grade. The Grade Level scale ranges from 10-50 with 50 being the most readable text. The following are the examples and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for each:  

The number of words ranges from 70-540 for Grade Level 10.
The number of sentences ranges from 40-280 for Grade Level 10.
The number of syllables ranges from 12-90 for Grade Level 10.


This is an example of a text that is in the 10-20 range for words, 40-60 range for sentences, and 13-19 range for syllables.

Note: the text used as the prompt was published in 1990 and the Grade Level is from the Flesch-Kincaid Scale which considers the total words, total sentences, and total syllables in a text.


When using the Grade Level scale it's good to remember that it can be a useful indicator, however not a perfect measure.
The Grade Level is only a guide and can be influenced by many factors so it's not a guarantee that an item will be easy to read.


Let's"," Cartoons had to have a specific character who talked with a specific voice. This is why Warner Bros. started the famous company, Super-friends, that brought together in its cast all the Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash and Arnie. The characters of the Super-friends are so famous that even today their faces can be found on millions of objects. The characters were drawn in specific poses, and the same applies to the computer programs that allow the creation of cartoons, which are always animated. This has meant that there are very few cartoons in which the characters do not move.  

In 1978, Jim Henson and his team started the famous characters known as the Muppets. The Muppets have also kept the character alive and animated them, without giving up the quality of human expression which makes them unique. 

In the early 1990s, Pixar, a leading computer animation company, started making computer programs that would help bring back to the screen the original style of cartoons that were on television and on the cinemas. One of these programs was called Computer graphics, and through this program the artists of Pixar started drawing animated characters of all ages, all with the same distinct style. 

By now, cartoons are no longer limited to the cinema screen. The Internet and the development of 3D have allowed animation programs that allow the creation of cartoons with complex movements that can be shared through the various social media platforms. This has generated a revival"
" ""When they are still interested I will take them, but most will start to want to play the violin by five.""

The violin is a very young instrument and requires a lot of work to learn to play it. At three the child should be able to sit still and hold the violin but will have a lot to learn about posture and muscle memory. By four the child should be able to keep their eye on the music and to see if they can play a few semiquaver arpeggios or thirds, while holding the instrument correctly. By five the child should have the ability to read a violin part, play a slow movement and a solo with good posture and good muscle memory.

However it's important to note that there is no such thing as the right age to start violin playing. Some children take longer to pick up the violin because they are in a form of musical education. It also depends on the child's motivation. If the child is a little more reluctant the best approach is to let them discover themselves - the violin is a very forgiving instrument.

Margaret Porter is a music teacher and violinist with many years of experience. She currently teaches violin and has performed with several orchestras and soloists.

No Title The best age to learn to play the violin is between three and six. The violin requires a lot of hard work to learn but at this age the child will have the ability to keep their eye on the music and to"," ""If you start violin early it has to be a love of it,"" says Margaret. ""It could be a family member playing the violin or you have that spark for it. But if you were an indifferent violinist at three you will be a indifferent violinist at six."" Margaret encourages parents to take children who are love to learn with their own hands. ""It will give you a sense of what your child is doing,"" she says. ""You will get a sense of independence and self-confidence if you are able to train your child yourself."" And the best bit about violin lessons is that your child will want to continue them when they are older. You can do this in your own home with lessons from Margaret who has a large personal library of music. ""You could just play whatever you like,"" says Margaret ""If you like Mozart you can play through a Mozart concerto. If you like Baroque you can play a Baroque concerto. But if you like modern you will enjoy listening to lots of different genres."" Margaret will start violin from age three. ""I find three very stimulating and then we will go from there.""

"," ""I am a firm believer that you should only start to expect too much from a child when they are 6."" The violin is a musical instrument that dates back over 400 years and a child can start to learn when they are 3 or 4. The strings are plucked, bowed and squeezed by the child in a variety of patterns and at different speeds, requiring them to listen carefully and repeat what they've heard. Margaret's favourite tunes include Carrickfergus and Dashing White Serpents. She teaches the violin and other instruments at the Music Together School in the capital, a free establishment which Margaret started more than 20 years ago. She loves to hear the children's musical aspirations and encourages them to write them down in the pupil's notebook. ""It really gets me excited when I see a child taking an interest in music and wanting to learn more. ""If we have music we tend to think of it in more peaceful ways, but in this modern age the violin has also had an important part to play in military operations."" As part of her curriculum she introduces her pupils to composers such as Bartók, Stravinsky and Bach. ""We study and think about the melodies and rhythms and explore the styles of writing they have used."" The School aims to encourage children to think for themselves, to work independently, and to take responsibility. Margaret believes it is important to give children the freedom to make mistakes and to think for themselves. ""If you are overprotective of a child,"," ""They seem to have an innate sense of what they need to get out of a piece of music. They are very self-critical and if something is not coming out right they want to fix it and are very hard to distract. The six year olds are also very capable but they are still learning scales and are very much still in the discovery stage of the instrument. ""There are many different types of violin with a range of price and they can be used for different purposes. The most popular used in classical music is the viola; it is often used in a quartet where the violin, viola and cello play together, or as an accompanist for a solo instrument. In other types of music such as Pop or Jazz the violin is used more solo although it can be used in a quartet. There is also a violin bow that is much thinner than a cello bow that is easier to play. ""Music continues to be a passion of mine and I still teach at all grade levels so I am very enthusiastic about helping children to start to learn the violin"". Margaret loves to play the violin and has played for many years; she has even composed her own music ""I don't think I could ever get away from music. It is in my genes"". ""I also teach cello and teach a range of different instruments from guitar, piano and bass guitar as part of my other activities. I live in the suburbs of London but am happy to travel to lessons or wherever"," The violin, she says, is all about listening and about feeling. It's an ideal instrument to learn these skills as it requires very little physical effort. ""You don't have to hold the violin or pick it up or put it down. You just have to be sitting and listening and you are learning."" Margaret started violin lessons when her sister enrolled her. ""I loved the violin from the first time I touched it. I fell in love with the sound and the music was about the most relaxing. Playing the violin is fun, it's something to focus on, feel things and use your imagination. That's why it's a great instrument for children,"" she says. ""And don't forget that it teaches you an important life skill - how to communicate, how to listen and to be an individual.

This is the start of a two-part interactive, multimedia learning experience on the violin - from the perspective of an adult player. The following pages provide additional background information on the violin and on violin music.

She gives them violin lessons during the week and takes them to the park on Fridays so they can run around and pick leaves and rocks to practice their posture. 
On Saturdays she'll put them in an orchestra and Margaret is the concertmaster which means she's in charge of all the little details. For instance, every Thursday she takes them to the park, so she can practice.
Margaret's three-year-old, Max, has a clear sense of rhythm and he loves listening to the radio. He especially likes the BBC National Orchestra of Wales because it plays symphonic music, and Max says, ""that's what I want to do when I grow up.""

The diary begins on January 21, 1660, with the entry:

""This day was a very extraordinary happy night, for the fire-ships came up the river tonight.""

This is the first known entry of the diary. Pepys records the great fire of London on June 10 1666:

""And it being now very late, I resolved to sit up, and, being more at leisure by and by, wrote down the most remarkable passages of my mind.""

On January 9 1668, Pepys reports a visit from the king:

The opening paragraph of the diary reads:

On waking (about 6 o’clock) this morning, by God’s leave, I was pretty well pleased with myself that I had a good night’s rest, having slept very well, upon which account my dreams were mostly such as would tend to make me ashamed of my sluggish hours last night. I was troubled with a pain in my right thigh in the morning, but dismissed it, and all things considered a very pleasant one. 

The story could start with a chronological rundown of events of the time of writing, such as disease, a foreign navy entering English waters, and a fire that decimated the city of London. These would follow Pepys’ own reaction to the event, with references to the pain in his thigh as a result of sleeping on a hard bed. The story would then return to summarizing the preceding events in the diary. 

The story would conclude with a reflection on the value and relevance of the diary to current events.

Samuel Pepys was a prominent seventeenth-century diarist. He kept a daily record of the daily happenings in his London household during the years 1660 to 1669. His diary is one of the most famous and well-regarded volumes of English language material from the time period. Pepys was a wealthy and well-connected man, so his diary contains many references to social and political events of the day. 
Many phrases from Pepys's diary are straightforward, memorised facts, such as the following examples: 
""An act of Parliament was passed that restricted the wearing"

Early people probably did not consider how shoes would change our future, but it is possible that they created the designs with special meaning. For instance some of the earliest footwear may have been protection against fire. During the Bronze Age there was an increase in the population of civilizations and the demand for fire protection also increased. 

Shoe styles also had a big impact on human migration. During the Ice Age, when the climate was cold, people migrated to the south of Europe to warmer climates. There was also a greater need to hunt animals due to the reduced population. Shoes allowed people to move faster and be more mobile. 

Over time, with the development of new materials, shoe design changed. Different areas of the world now had their own style of footware. Today we see different shoes for different types of terrain, for example ski shoes are shaped differently to football boots. 

By 1500 BC, shoes had become a necessity in human society. Shoes are now worn for daily activities such as going to work, going to the gym or going to the pub. Shoes are also an important symbol of self-confidence and personality.


The following are all examples of different types of shoes: 

- Traditional leather boots 
- Slippers for children 
- Sneakers for street wear 
- Football boots for sport


In conclusion, throughout history, shoes have had a big impact on human migration, survival, fashion"," During the reign of Alexander the Great shoes became more fashionable among his upper class supporters with the invention of the stirrup which allowed the rider to remain balanced whilst mounting a horse. This in turn led to the development of the shoe which became more flexible and durable. We now take our shoes for granted but during that time people worked hard to develop the shoe for both the wearer and the environment they were constructed in.


Write a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners using the following prompt:

Alexander the Great was a Greek ruler whose army would conquer much of the Middle East and North Africa during the 4th century BCE. When he was young the popular shoe was the sandal but he developed the stirrup in order to advance his people's position in the empire. The invention of the stirrup eventually lead to the development of the shoe which became more flexible and durable.


Write a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners using the following prompt:

Around the year 1750 British shoe-makers began mass-producing leather boots to meet the needs of the expanding transportation network. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied around their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion.


Write a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners using the following prompt:

The first Britains boots were popular for their comfort and versatility but eventually leather began","  

In ancient Greece men's feet were covered with leather sandals called manacles. In the Middle Ages, men and boys would put on a pair of wooden clogs known as shoes or buckles. During the Renaissance shoes became an accessory for women. In the early 17th century Mary Shelley's favorite pair of shoes were Elizabethan buckles.  

Since the Industrial Revolution, the importance of shoes has risen and they have become a necessity for many people. Shoes have replaced buckles as the preferred foot covering for women. Children still wear wooden clogs but adults now prefer shoes with laces, zipper or Velcro fastenings, closed cell foam insoles and other improvements.  

In the future shoes may be made from biodegradable or carbon neutral materials, have heating and cooling controls for individual feet and integrate features such as an mp3 player to allow people to listen to music whilst walking. 

In summary, the History of Shoes tells us about the development of shoes through the ages and shows how they have become an important part of peoples daily lives.


##  Historical Evidence for the History of Shoes 

-   Ancient Greeks did not wear fashionable or comfortable shoes. 

-   A man's shoes from the Middle Ages provide evidence for their usage. 

-   Shoes were popular for women's footwear in the 17th century. 

-   Wooden clogs replaced buckles as"," Shoes became fashionable in Ancient Greece, after Alexander the Great started using his troops to defeat his enemies while on horseback. His soldiers were equipped with superior footwear which led to an increase in the populations of people wearing shoes. The Roman Empire spread their culture around the world with the use of footwear and the Roman Coliseum is still used to this day as a place of entertainment. Shoes have become extremely fashionable in modern times but the question remains; is it important to keep our shoes new and clean or should we just throw them away every so often? 

I will use the following paragraph as the starting point for my story: 

""In the past importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins which people tied around their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today but other materials such as silk plastic or cotton are also popular depending on what is in fashion. Shoes became fashionable in Ancient Greece, after Alexander the Great started using his troops to defeat his enemies while on horseback. His soldiers were equipped with superior footwear which led to an increase in the populations of people wearing shoes."" 

I would like your opinion on whether the paragraph contains clear and simple language, or verbose and complex language. I will use the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale to analyse the text.

A:

The first sentence contains simple and clear language; however, the rest of the text"," 

Some people in the past would go barefooted to protect their feet when it was cold whereas today we may wear wool socks. Some traditional shoes were rather impractical like the Spanish ""espadrille"" which was shaped like a shoe but had holes in the sole to keep the wearer's feet still. 

In some cases shoes became fashionable which caused demand for the materials used to make them. For example the Italian Renaissance made the ""zamarra"" a popular piece of clothing as it was practical as a vest and warm enough to keep out the elements. 

During the Industrial Revolution mass production techniques meant that shoes could be cheaply mass produced and the demand increased even more. This caused shoe manufacturers to expand their production lines leading to innovations such as the ""sneaker"" which was made of rubber for a cheaper cost but due to lack of support offered by the foot the wearer would typically end up with sore feet and also the fact that the foot was unsupported by the shoe. 

During World War 2 shoe production had to be restricted due to the material shortage caused by the German blockade but as soon as the war ended there was a huge demand for shoes as people resumed their daily routines. As a result shoe production continued to expand and technological advances such as ""polyvinyl chloride"" (PVC) caused a reduction in the amount of leather used. 

By the early 21st century shoes were no longer a necessary item of clothing for humans but still form","  

In the 18th century we see the rise of shoes becoming an everyday necessity for both men and women. It was thought fashionable for women to wear flat feet which led to the development of the rigid heel and instep. This would not allow the wearer to walk in a fashionable style which would be considered slouching. During this period, the popularity of shoes also expanded into the military market with the wearing of high top boots for soldiers in battle. This ultimately lead to a new form of foot wear for prisoners called “gaol shoes” where prisoners were forced to wear high top boots for protection against the elements. 

Modern shoes were developed to improve on the original footwear designs. We now wear shoes that are flexible or moulded to our feet to reduce impact and enhance comfort. Shoes can also be made out of light weight plastics to make them more portable. With the development of transportation came the need to make shoes lighter for longer travel. 

Although shoes are a necessity for humans, it wasn’t until the 19th century that we see the first references to shoe manufacturing. With the increased popularity of manufacturing shoes came a concern for worker safety during manufacture. This eventually led to the use of rubber to make soles which would protect the workers feet from the factory machinery. 

Although shoes have changed drastically throughout the years, it is interesting to note that they have not completely lost their importance. Most people still wear shoes today to protect their feet from the"," Shoes are one of the ways people express their personalities. High heeled shoes were particularly associated with aristocrats. The first shoes were probably a people covering, but as people became more affluent they were made from leather. High fashion shoe designs appeared in the 14th century and are thought to have had a big influence on the invention of the steam engine. There are many periods in history that have had a major influence on the course of fashion. At present fashion can be changed and adapted much more quickly than ever before. This is because shoes are now produced with a range of new technologies.

" But that’s how trains work, you’re forced to suffer delay after delay when you’re stuck in one for hours or even days on end. After traveling 8 hours, the train pulled into Adelaide and despite the pleas of the many locals, they refused to get off. For many it was their final train journey, not to visit their family or friends as such, but to sleep under the same roof as the animal that ate their arm.


The train arrived in Adelaide just as the sun was setting. As people exited the carriages they made their way to the nearest bar, to wait for the Ghan to return the following morning. They knew that the train only departed for its next stop the following morning. Everyone was anxious to experience another day of the train, to feel the heat, the sand, the wind. But no one would be sleeping under the same roof as the arm-eating beast. In the end the train arrived the following morning with no further delay than it had been the day before. The locals once again refused to get off the train but this time there were no pleading eyes looking up from under a bushel, there were no angry shouts demanding their return. No, this time no one would be sleeping on the Ghan. Instead, the arm-eating beast had returned to its previous resting place and they were again stuck in their seats, pretending that the desert hadn’t just devoured their home and their arm.


The","  The Ghan train took 17 days to travel from one end of the continent to the other.  On the 16th day the Ghan train passed through a small town called Coober Pedy which is notorious for its unique ability to make the human body smell like a freshly cleaned room.  The Ghan train pulled into Adelaide station where many travellers alighted to their homes for Christmas.  However, the Ghan train was late again and did not arrive for many Christmas Day celebrations.  One year a group of travellers decided to set out early to search for the Ghan train.  They set off in a direction that seemed promising but soon came to a small station called Wudinman.  There was no Ghan train there, they had found another train, the Wudinman. 

The group of travellers now travelled around the small station, looking for the Ghan train, but to no avail.  They came to a road crossing where there were vehicles travelling in both directions.  One of the travellers got in the oncoming traffic, the other 6 set off walking.  The group of travellers found the Ghan train at the next small station called Long Ghan.  The group celebrated their reunion, but when they returned to the station, there were no signs of the Ghan train and so another search began.  A large trucking company was heading south but they said they could take them back to Darwin.  This suited the travellers just"," 
On the morning of the 4th of October 1974 the Ghan train departed Darwin at 8:45am bound for Adelaide. It travelled for 14 hours covering a distance of 1500km. Arriving in Adelaide late in the evening of the 5th of October, the Ghan train was three hours and forty minutes late for its scheduled time of arrival. As soon as the Ghan train pulled into the Adelaide railway station platform the passengers realised they had made a grave error in leaving such a late for their arrival. The Ghan passengers and their luggage were all met at the railway station by local taxi drivers who offered to take them to their hotels. To the passengers dismay it seemed that they would miss their celebratory celebrations that evening. Unfortunately their driver’s generosity was short lived. The taxi driver quickly realised that they were late and that they had travelled far and wide to arrive in Adelaide on time. The taxi driver informed the passengers that if they cared to pay for the taxi ride he would drive them to their hotels but they must first have their luggage unloaded from the Ghan train. 
Once the luggage was removed from the Ghan train the passengers and their taxi driver were able to enjoy their celebrations that evening. The Ghan passengers did manage to save a few celebratory bottles of wine from their long journey from the south to the north. The Ghan passengers also took the opportunity to sample the local cuisine as well as an alcoholic beverage known locally as ‘yerbrick’.","

Example text:
One day, when Ghan was seven years old, his father told him he would be a train driver one day. He would drive the famous Ghan train that travels across the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean.


One day, when Ghan was seven years old, his father told him he would be a train driver one day. He would drive the famous Ghan train that travels across the Australian continent from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. The train would be Ghan's dream come true, his way of reaching the Southern Ocean. After all, his family was from Adelaide, and he had always wanted to see the ocean. He packed his bag, packed his lunch, and said goodbye to his family.
","

The Ghan train was late for many reasons including the fact that it had to cross a desert and that it was very hot and there was no shade, and the fact that there was a truck which ran a red light and collided with the Ghan train. The truck was carrying fresh coffee beans from Australia’s northern tropical coast to a coffee roasting plant in the city of Adelaide. The truck carried on the right hand side of the road and was going at speed. The truck was carrying 32 tons of coffee and came to rest near a train station. The Ghan train was the only vehicle that passed that scene. 

The driver of the truck, Anthony Joseph Chung, was extremely irate at being stuck next to the massive truck containing fresh coffee. It was his first time driving a truck across the desert and he did not know where the road would lead. He was also worried that if he slowed down too much the truck would blow up and he would be left with 32 tons of coffee in the middle of the desert. He was also hot, tired and hungry. His anger, fatigue and hunger combined to produce an event which is scientifically known as ‘car accident’. Anthony Joseph Chung was justifiably angry. The driver of the Ghan train, George Ottaway, understood the driver’s point of view and also empathised with Chung. He understood the dangers of desert driving and the difficulties of a journey by rail across Australia"," On the journey of over 5000 kilometers, the Ghan experienced many trials including being struck by lightning, losing its passenger train carriage and engine and derailment. It was eventually hit by a goods train and became a burning heap. With only 4 kilometres to go, the Ghan arrived in Adelaide where it was met with public celebrations and the inauguration of the Governor of South Australia, Sir Henry Ingpen. However, Sir Henry only had the honorary role that day as it was his wife, Lady Ingpen, who had organized and led the relief effort for the Adelaide and Flinders hospitals after the cyclone that devastated the city six months earlier. She had also helped in the creation of the new Hospital of Undefined Significance. Sir Henry was born in 1839.

The Ghan Train was built in 1936 and designed by the General Railway Construction Corporation of Australia. It was built in six months in just under half a million dollars. The Ghan train is one of only two surviving passenger trains on the former broad gauge rail network of Australia which ceased in 1993, the other being the Melbourne Great Railway Flyer. Since its opening, the Ghan has travelled on a daily basis between Darwin and Adelaide, stopping at all the major towns along the way. In 2001, the Ghan Train was inscribed by the Australian Government in the Australian Railway Train Heritage Group’s ‘Heritage 100’ list of Australia’s most notable passenger trains.


The Ghan Train","


The train set off at 10.30pm on a hot summer’s night. The train left Darwin on its usual route but this time would avoid the dreaded outback as it headed east. It was a beautiful night, with the faint murmur of water ahead and a starlit sky that was broken only by the occasional lightning strike. The Ghan train slowed down and the engineer flicked the switch to switch off the main lights and the aircon. Suddenly the train erupted into life. First came the thunderous sound of the aircon, then the roar of the engine and finally a clacking noise as the wheels rolled over the track. The sound of the engine filled the still night air and soon the train was picking up speed, lurching and rattling over the rails. The aircon was switched back on, as the train juddered to a halt at the next station. This time there was no stopping the train, with a few minor delays it got up to speed and in twenty minutes reached the next station. The passengers were in a festive mood, having just eaten the lunch packed by the train company that had been waiting for them in the car. The food tasted wonderful, the chocolate cake particularly moist and flavoursome. Soon the train was again rocking along, this time at a faster pace. The driver announced the next station and then it was time to settle down for the night.


The next morning the passengers awoke to a grey"

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is used by schools and educational providers around the world to measure the readability of text.  The scale is based on word counts from a sample of text drawn from a general population of people, and assigns a numeric grade value for each text.  This scale has three subscales: words per sentence, words per sentence (if partial), and sentences per paragraph.  These are combined into a single overall grade value.  The overall grade value ranges from 0 - 200, with texts generally classified in the lower end of the scale (e.g. 0-75).


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is typically applied after the text has been analysed in order to identify the number of words, sentences and syllables per unit of reading.  This means that the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level alone cannot be used to measure the"," These cars were so successful that Ford Motor Company was founded. He died in 1947.

Henry Ford was an American car manufacturer who came from an agricultural background. He started out by repairing bicycles and then became interested in cars. He made a few makeshift cars out of parts he found around the farm but it was not until he was fifteen years old that he began to produce working cars.

Henry Ford's career path did not go in a straight line from then on and it took fifteen years for the car manufacturer to become established. The most important thing is that Ford made cars which became so popular that the company was eventually turned into a multi-billion dollar business.


Henry Ford's car manufacturing company was established in the late 1800s and it still exists today. The company specialises in manufacturing passenger cars and light trucks. One of Ford's most famous models is the Ford F-150 truck which he launched in the 1950s. He also produced the Ford Mustang sports car which was first launched in 1964. 
Henry Ford is also known for the Model T car which was first launched in 1908. This car has since become a classic and it is valued by car collectors. Ford was able to make his car manufacturing career from a small-scale business starting from scratch.

Atlantic College


In 1883 a young man called Frederic Smith founded what would become Atlantic College. Smith, a civil engineer by trade, was interested in education for the higher learning and believed that"," When the bell rings we all head for the lunch break.  We all sit down together at a large table and I overheard one of the students saying to another 'I really fancy that girl next to me, do you think I should say something?'. I turned round to see the girl and asked her 'Are you being sarcastic?'. 'No, actually, but I thought I should point out that I am pretty much alone at this table' I turned back to my lunch and didn't see the comment any more. 

Here is my entry:

The Atlantic College Last week I went to visit Atlantic College an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom as well as the opportunity to study for their exams. The students who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world spend the morning studying. When the bell rings we all head for the lunch break. We all sit down together at a large table and I overheard one of the students saying to another 'I really fancy that girl next to me, do you think I should say something?'. I turned round to see the girl and asked her 'Are you being sarcastic?'. 'No, actually, but I thought I should point out that I am pretty much alone at this table' I turned back to my lunch and didn't see the comment any more. 

Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 7."," We then have a coffee in the refectory and then in the afternoon they get the chance to take part in activities designed to introduce them to aspects of the local area, for example a visit to St. Dogmaels Abbey where they can see some fine 13th century masonry and take part in a tour of the abbey. The afternoon is rounded off by the students singing in the cathedral where the acoustics are particularly good. This offers a rare opportunity for young people to take part in a full morning worship service in addition to singing in the cathedral. The Cathedral is of course the focal point of the town and is the venue for concerts and other events. I was extremely impressed by the quality of education on offer, the facilities are very good as is the location. It gives young people a real taste of life beyond the classroom and I would heartily recommend it to anyone.

The afternoon is for training activities to improve skills for both the exam and later on in life. There are numerous sports teams on the college campus, although the students usually travel to different parts of Wales to compete. The cost to attend Atlantic College is not cheap but for a young person it gives them both the opportunity to study and also experience life outside the classroom in a really nice environment. As an A2 learner I thoroughly enjoyed the day. I studied from the books that were provided as well as watching videos that were produced by the college and it really paid off in the exam. It was a great experience and I shall definitely return!

" Our plan that night had been to spend a long weekend climbing on the wall outside. We'd packed rope, belay devices and all the other bits and bobs you need to climb a route, and now I was hanging 30 metres above a river. It was a lot closer to the ground than I'd anticipated. But I'd always wanted to climb and now my ambition was within grasp. That evening we'd talked about what material we'd bring for our rope, but hadn't really done much thinking about what type of gear would actually make us safer while we were climbing. We'd settled on 40mm wide rope because that's what most of the routes we wanted to climb seemed to use. We'd brought a 40mm X-Treme Cinch RAP device, but hadn't considered anything like the Bear Grylls Safe Rope, because when it came down to it we were adventurers, not survivalists. We weren't concerned with being caught out if the rope snapped. After all, we'd have a rope break for the entire weekend and a Bear Grylls survival bag full of gear to keep us going if we got in trouble. So we set off the following Saturday morning for our first climb. As we were walking down the main road from the Activity Centre we saw a sign for a route called ""The Narrows"". Now, the Narrows looked a lot harder than it actually was, but we decided to give it a go. We arrived at"," It was a Saturday and so there was plenty of parking available in the large underground car park. We'd only climbed two walls of the Centre when we heard a familiar voice call down from above: ""Hi guys, how's it going?"" 
  * ""Great, thanks!"" I shouted up to our guide Chris. He smiled down at me. ""Just remember, when your feet first hit the ground, that's called 'climbing'."" He nodded and continued on his way, his footsteps echoing around the underground space. 
  * We quickly completed the third wall. ""That's enough for today,"" Chris called down. ""Your feet first hit the ground on the way down."" I watched in amazement as Chris placed one foot carefully on the ground and it simply bounced back up. He gave me a smug grin. ""Nice one."" 
  * I quickly tried out Chris's advice, and with some help from the cushion of my climbing helmet, managed to land on my feet. I'd just enough time to look down at the ground before a large hand was pushing me off again. My feet crashed back to the ground and I watched in amazement as Chris started counting down from three. I could see him out of the corner of my eye as he said ""2"" and I quickly kicked off. 
  * I flew up into the air again. This time I managed to grab the rock above with both hands. My feet found the holds and I continued to"," It was the end of a two-week course that would lead to a qualification.  
Today is the last day of the course. Tomorrow we'll be going home but we've made some great friends here and we will certainly be returning for future courses. The course was run by an experienced instructor who clearly loved what she did. The route we had for the day was challenging but do-able. We chose it because it featured a sequence of multi-pitch routes that could all be climbed. This is important because multi-pitch routes are where the real fun happens. You have two or more pitches to ascend with a variety of different difficulties. The instructor made sure we understood each route up and down each pitch. We were able to choose our climbing shoes from a range of options and were provided with all the equipment we would need to complete the day. In fact, we were provided climbing shoes, chalk, harness, carabiners, nuts, hex nuts, ice axes and emergency gear. We also received detailed instruction on how to set up and disassemble our gear.  
Once we'd arrived at the route we climbed immediately. The ground was a bit wet and muddy from the recent rain, which made for interesting steps, but it didn't hinder our progress. Our instructor was quick to give helpful advice and encouragement. Together we made sure each other safe. We didn't talk much because our instructor had specifically asked us to stay silent so we could focus on climbing the route"," The building had been built on the site of an old quarry, and the rough stone walls had helped us find our way around the place. We were lucky; there wasn't much to the Centre except for a few climbing walls and a small gym. This was more than enough space to practice our new sport - rock-climbing. 
""Are you guys going to start climbing right away?"" I asked.
""As a matter of fact, we are"", Matt answered, ""our instructor will be here soon."" 
So that's what we did: we waited and milled around the Centre. After a few hours of this we heard a loud clanking sound from the direction of one of the climbing walls. After a few more minutes a group of people came running down the stairs. They all looked a bit out of breath and looked pretty hot. 
""Welcome to Rock City!"" the guy said. ""I'm Dave, your instructor for the evening. Let me show you to your gear and we'll get started.""
""Sounds good"", I said. ""I hope Dave doesn't recognise me, I'm Matt.""
""Oh, sorry"", Dave said. ""I was about to show the new guy the ropes - you've got a new look, by the way.""
""Thanks"", I said.
I was feeling a bit nervous and also a bit curious. So I decided to go along and check it out. I followed Dave across"," After clearing a fast-track route down a rock buttress we were determined to climb a route called 'Big Mango'. We got to the belay stance and I pulled up the anchor and was just about to clip in when out of the corner of my eye I noticed a movement. I turned my head and a large brown snake was coiled up near the belay stance. I froze and watched as the snake slowly moved from side to side. Matt must have seen it too, because he turned to look as the snake began to slither further away. I thought that the snake would never reach the ground, but then it did, and quickly. I watched in disbelief as the snake disappeared over the crest and out of view, only to reappear on the other side of the river below us. We both laughed. The snake wasn't going to attack us - it was probably a day-walker. We continued down the route and before we knew it we were at the final stance. We unclipped and made our way down the wall, clipping into the next stance after that. It was only after we'd reached the ground that we realised the snake wasn't the least bit surprised at our behaviour. When I tried to explain what had happened to Matt he just laughed and agreed that the snake was probably just an unwelcome day-walker. We went home that night relieved that we'd enjoyed an experience that even most people wouldn't find normal - even to this day we can"," The room looked out onto the River Severn and was equipped with all the essential equipment and gear to make our first climb. We'd been taught everything we needed to know by our instructor, Matt, and now it was time to try it out. 

After changing into our climbing harnesses and a pair of climbing gloves, I sat quietly on the edge of the roof gazing out across the valley. It was such a beautiful day and with the exception of a few distant hills, the terrain below looked as though it stretched on forever. 

I looked at Matt and he smiled. ""You ok up there?"" he asked.

""I am fine, I've always found climbing really helps clear your head. Besides, I can look down and not feel so high up,"" I said. We'd decided to go for the sport's most popular route, The Lose Arms, which went straight across the centre of the roof of the Activity Centre. 

""Ok, try and look as low as you can,"" Matt replied as he reached out and grabbed a hold of a piece of metalwork at the edge of the roof. I took a step closer and leaned back. I felt a rush of adrenaline as my feet slid off the safety netting and my hands grabbed hold of thin air. The rush was overwhelming and I felt like I was weightless for a moment. I glanced down as I swung from one handhold to the next, trying to find a position that"," To get to the climbing wall we'd first have to navigate our way through the maze of zip-lines, rope bridges and obstacle courses that make up the park. After two failed attempts at finding the activity centre we decided to go for a walk instead. We headed to a field to stare at the stars.

The view from the Activity Centre was fantastic - hundreds of people were doing all different sorts of activities, from rock climbing to kite-surfing. I'd never done kite-surfing before, but I soon learnt how to hang from a line and flap my arms to fly. The view from the Activity Centre was amazing, but I really was only hanging 30 metres above the ground! A long, thin ladder led down to the river, and that's where I was staying, watching the stars and feeling pretty satisfied. But after about 10 minutes I started to feel bored, and my friends Matt and Luke were going off to do their own thing. So, I climbed down again to see what else was on offer, and I started to read the plaques. 

There were hundreds of plaques throughout the Activity Centre, but none of them mentioned rock-climbing. I couldn't understand why - when I got home I Googled it, and it looked like there was a Rock-Climbing Union, but you had to apply for a membership and get approved by them to climb at the Activity Centre. The only other thing was a set of instructions"
" Fortunately, the bus driver stopped at the next stop and I was able to get a taxi back to my hotel. Luckily, my purse and address book was still on the bus but I'm afraid that's the least of my problems. I now have neither my purse nor my wallet and all my credit cards are gone. As you know, in the UK, it is against the law to leave something belonging to another person on a bus. I've reported the incident to the police but I'm afraid I may not be able to go to the theatre this evening or to visit my grandson when he's home from hospital. What can you do for me?

The letter writer didn't know what to do and was worried. She is very lucky that she was able to return home safely, but has been significantly affected by losing her wallet and purse. She is worried that she will be unable to go to the theatre tonight or pay her grandson's medical bills.

When I arrived home I discovered that the purse was not there and someone had taken my credit cards and cheque book. There is now a police investigation into the theft and I'm worried about having lost so much money. What can I do to protect myself? 
In the short term you can protect your identity by not carrying around a purse as this makes it easier for thieves to grab your purse and take your money. Additionally, you can consider increasing the amount of cash you carry. 
You can protect your wallet and make it difficult for thieves to access your information by using a security card (e.g. an EMV chip card). This can be done by having a machine swipe the card at cash points or at the supermarket. You can also consider using a money clip or an ID wallet for carrying cash. A money clip could be secured by putting your cards in a clipboard. 

The author recommends that you get a security card (EMV chip card) so that it is harder for thieves to access your information.

Unfortunately there was no record of my cheque book address book or my purse in their computer, but they did manage to trace a Mr William Shuttleworth who lives at 6 The Crescent, South Wales. When I told him what had happened he offered to call me a cab but I felt I would be more comfortable if the bus company came and picked me up. 

Mr William Shuttleworth has kindly offered to help me locate my items which were lost on the Newport City bus on Saturday afternoon. He has informed me that he is a former employee of the company who now lives at 6 The Crescent and he will call the bus company to ask them to collect me from my home. He has also offered to pay for the cost of the cab that was later called for me by Mr Shuttleworth. The bus company was very helpful and agreed to call Mr Shuttleworth and collect me from his home.

I am very grateful to Mr Shuttleworth and will certainly be raising this in my cheque book letter writing campaign.

Mr Shuttleworth, can you please call the bus company and ask them to collect me from my home after 1 pm on Saturday?

Within two weeks of opening, customer feedback on the new shop online site had been positive. However, within three weeks of opening, customer feedback on the site had become extremely negative.

" But more than that, the Eden Project is a living laboratory for the UK’s best and brightest scientists to test the limits of horticulture and science and to solve real problems for the environment. The Eden Project is a model for future gardens across the world.

What is the Eden Project?

The Eden Project is a former limestone quarry that was converted into a tourist attraction, with features such as ‘biospheres’ where you can see different climates on different patches of soil. It has become an important tourist attraction and learning centre for science and horticulture across the UK. It is open to visitors year round and offers various educational activities, such as horticultural, zoological, meteorological and agricultural tours, as well as a planetarium.

One of the highlights of the Eden Project is the ‘biosphere’ which houses a diverse range of climates and ecosystems. You can select different soil types in the biosphere depending on the climate you wish to experience and then plant seeds and watch their growth. When the plants are flowering and growing, you can view the ecosystem within the biosphere.

The Eden Project is considered a living laboratory for science and horticulture that allows visitors to test the limits of horticulture and science. It has won the Plant of the Year in the horticultural industry and has helped to increase visitor numbers by over 200,000 a year. Over the years, the Eden Project has"," Visitors can help to grow new plants and watch the plants grow in conditions ranging from temperate to arid. There is even a temperature and humidity controlled section where visitors can view plants under conditions that closely duplicate those of a rainforest. The idea that one day even ordinary people could have a role to play in helping the planet is very appealing. Even if the Eden Project can’t yet offer that prospect to everyone, it has helped to open the eyes of visitors to the need for new ways to engage with the natural world and is one of the reasons that the UK was recently named ‘Green Heart of Europe’ by a French environmental organisation.


The Eden Project Since it opened the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK’s most popular tourist attractions. At first sight the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere contains a different climate zone showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. Visitors can help to grow new plants and watch the plants grow in conditions ranging from temperate to arid.

The idea that one day even ordinary people could have a role to play in helping the planet is very appealing. Even if the Eden Project can’t yet offer that prospect to everyone, it has helped to open the eyes"," A biosphere replicates the micro-climate of a certain region of the world, and Eden’s head of development says this is because climate change is such a major threat to the planet’s eco-system that we must begin to look at it in terms of ‘climate zones’.  ‘Many countries all over the world are recognising that the only way to keep the planet viable for humans and the wildlife that relies on it, is to change our relationship to nature,’ says Mr Pike. ‘We are moving towards thinking of it more in terms of eco-systems that support biodiversity. We are looking at a number of eco-zones, such as tropical rainforests, deserts and polar regions. It would not be economic to recreate all of the world’s biodiversity in one place, but by recognising that there are different eco-systems and that they are interdependent, it allows us to manage them together and benefit all.’ A2 readers will be able to work out that the Eden Project has become a major tourist attraction by understanding the concept of climate change. They will be able to see that the biosphere represents a climate zone, because visitors enter through the ‘ tropics ‘, and as they move through each climate zone they see something different, from tropical rainforest to desert to polar regions. Mr Pike says that the project has grown because it shows people that climate change is happening and must be changed for their own survival, and because it promotes biodiversity"," Tour guides lead visitors through ‘hydroponic’ gardens made up of modules, each one representing a plant species and their respective climatic zone. The visitors taste test the juices of pumpkins and squashes in a pumpkin patch, which are grown using seeds and modules in this experimental ‘garden’. Next they visit a ‘farmed rainbow’ in a tent, where artificial sunlight illuminates the roots of tomatoes to show the growth of these plants in captivity. The visitors can then view the final biosphere which represents the whole world. They see plants from all different regions of the world growing in these modules. The visitors get to know the various plants better by touching and smelling them and are treated to delicious fruits such as oranges and kiwis. The biospheres, along with other elements of the Eden Project, such as a water park, a UFO walk, the Planetarium and planetarium cinema, have become popular tourist destinations. Tourists and locals alike flock to the site to get a glimpse of it all. But what is it actually? Why has the Eden Project become so popular? And what does this have to do with reading comprehension? It is often said that literature has a dual role in education. Firstly, it should help develop general literacy skills such as reading, writing and speaking, and secondly it should help students to develop more specific skills in reading closely and in depth texts. While literary works might not be of immediate relevance to our everyday lives, many of"," Visitors can walk around these beautiful ‘islands’ on which many plants have been ‘planted’ by tourists and the companies that employed them.

This is a fictional story about a fictional course ""Data Science"" at the Open University.


Data Science is a topic that is now very popular in universities around the world. It gives students an insight into how modern businesses work and how the data that they use can be analysed to help with important decisions. There are a whole range of subjects that are related to Data Science like Statistics, Data Visualisation and Mathematics all of which can be studied at a Masters or professional degree level.


The Open University has created a course called ""Data Science"" that covers a wide range of these subjects and many more. This course can be taken at any level from beginners to masters and it is very popular. There are also many professional organisations who run courses that are based around Data Science including Databricks, Splunk and Databricks Training.


The Data Science course can be a great opportunity to increase your knowledge and experience. Many people who have studied it move into Data Science careers and even if you don't become a Data Science professional you may end up with other professional opportunities related to data or statistics.


If you are an individual who has always had an interest in Data Science and the Open University is a good way to explore this subject you should think about applying for a place on the Data Science course. Many students find it very enjoyable and a useful experience that increases their knowledge. Some go on to professional Data Science careers and are now considered Data Scientists.

The following text was written by a fictional person called Dolly who has studied at an Open University.

I've never studied before so this is going to be interesting. I'm going to have to increase my knowledge of everything that has a liquid form. Things that change into liquids, liquids that change into solids, and solids that change into gases. I'm probably going to have to study Physics or Chemistry - though Physics should be OK as liquids are made of atoms with positive and negative charges.

I'll have to use the Open University Book Club, which has a wealth of knowledge in it. They also teach you how to study yourself. All the books are on the internet so all I need to do is look up the key words on the internet and type them into the search engine on my laptop. I'm going to have to study subjects that interest me, so I might want to look at Chemistry, because I like looking at things and getting them to do what I want them to do. I can use the chemistry set I got for my 15th birthday to do that!

" Each band also played a different tune and played as well as they could on the day using the prompt given. The judges said my band sounded really together and they particularly liked the drums. I'm really pleased we won! Next year we will be doing our own composition, and I plan to ask the band members to write out the song with jazz riffs. I'm also going to learn more about jazz to include in our band's repertoire.


There are five players to your jazz band, so it is essential to practise. If you are going to be practicing alone you could try learning a few jazz standards, such as 'What a Wonderful World' or 'Highlights'.


There are some cool jazz tunes in the below list:

- 'Lush Life' by John Coltrane
- 'Blue 'n' Boogie' by Jimmy Raney
- 'Flower Drum Song' by the Beatles
- 'It's All Over' by Buddy Holly
- 'Blues for Bonnie' by Little Willie Littlefield


You could ask your band members to come up with a jazz tune and write it down. If you are doing this alone, I recommend practicing standard jazz tunes and learning the harmonies.


Jazz is about combining syncopated rhythms with improvised soloing. You could start by finding a syncopated drum rhythm and drum solo, and then improvise a solo on a jazz melody."," The winning band had a large jazz banner that said “I play the trumpet, I am a jazz band member, and I am a winner!” I thought the jazz competition was a great opportunity to show off my trumpet playing! 

Thank you for your response. I am currently playing the trumpet and learning the jazz style of playing. I will write the story using the prompts provided. 
Prompts: - 
Tell the story of your school jazz band’s winning the jazz competition. 
- The band’s banner said ‘I play the trumpet, I am a jazz band member, and I am a winner!’
- Some of the band members were wearing black school uniforms, while others wore brightly-coloured T-shirts.
- I thought the jazz competition was a great opportunity to show off my trumpet playing!


The story of our school jazz band’s winning the jazz competition is as follows:

We were the winners! The other bands from the competition all wore their school colours but ours had a large jazz banner that said ‘I play the trumpet, I am a jazz band member, and I am a winner!’

We won the jazz competition because we had the best costumes! Our band members wore black school uniforms, while others wore brightly-coloured T-shirts. I thought the jazz competition was a great opportunity to show off my trumpet playing!


I play the trumpet and I"," Our trumpeter wore a beautiful costume of blue velvet with a giant trumpet on their back. I played my trumpet in the competition, but also performed a number of solos in the band's other music. I learned all the jazz jazz tunes that the band played, and also some tunes I composed myself. The band were really impressive - they blew their trumpets really loud! They had a lot of energy and the costumes made them look great as well.

Please write a story about your jazz band in the style of a musical.  

This is a band of really talented musicians. The trumpeter wears a beautiful costume of blue velvet and they all play in the band. The band is so good that they won the local jazz competition!

The trumpeter started the band. They all agreed that they wanted to play jazz music, and their costumes were great for practising and looking good while doing it. They practice at the band room. 

The band played a jazz tune called 'I Got It Bad (And That's Bad)' and the other musicians said it was good. The trumpeter thought they should practice the jazz blues tune called 'Down the Line' too. 

The band tried the tune and it seemed to go well. They decided to perform it in the competition.

They went to the competition hall and put on their band's best performance so far. The trumpeter's costume shone and the trumpet made a beautiful sound."," The winners received gold medals. We rehearsed for two hours a day for two weeks and then had one hour of test on Monday morning. On the day of the competition we all waited outside the music hall, and our band, made of seven students, were the first to perform. We played “The Star-Spangled Banner” and “My Sweet Lord” – my favourite songs. Then the judges, who all wore black ties, crowed “Presented by the National Youth Jazz Orchestra” – and we won the competition! After the competition, my teacher and I asked the judges if they were sure we had won. They said they would have given the gold medal to our band even if it wasn’t us, they just like our band’s costume.


Your story could start with an introduction to the jazz band, including the name of the band and who is a member of the band. You could then talk about the local high school jazz bands taking part in a jazz competition which you were a part of, and discuss the importance of the competition. Next you could talk about the rehearsal and test days, showing how the school organised the jazz band’s participation in the competition, and how the test day went. You could finish with a celebration of the band’s win at the competition and the judges’ response.

Although we were all really happy with our own costumes, none of us liked seeing our bands’ shirts. They all said the same thing – the word JUICE on them. Our teacher, Miss Green, told us that jazz music comes from America and the USA is famous for its advertising campaigns and slogans. As a result, she wanted us to write our own slogan on our band shirts. Mine said:

JAZZ! is the new BLUE! 

I think the slogan is really funny because jazz music is kind of quiet and we are all wearing our jazz band T-shirts with loud graphics and slogans. However, all our shirts said the same slogan so you could hardly make out any of the words. It was like having too many shirts, but no less funny. 

I hope you like my jazz band’s slogan. Please tell me what you think in the comments!

* It’s a play on words – referencing the quiet nature of jazz music"," We each played a different musical instrument such as trumpet, violin, piano and saxophone.

The competition was held in the gymnasium of our local high school. We practised for several hours beforehand. I practised by myself, and then I practised with my trumpet part-ner. We played two new compositions we had written, and the rest of the members of our band participated in the rest of the pieces. On the day of the competition we practised again for several hours, then got dressed in our costumes. We waited until the beginning of the competition to reveal our costumes, and then played our own songs and the winning songs from the other bands. After the competition we played some of the songs we had performed during the competition for other audience members. The competition was very fun and we all had a lot of fun! As well as playing the trumpet, I also helped set up the stage, played an electric keyboard and did some lighting. I love jazz and I hope to continue playing it for a career in music!

Portola had read that the locals called San Francisco Sutter’s Land so he thought that is where they had settled. However when they got there they found that it was not part of Sutter’s Land it was part of Alta California (Upper California). Portola named it Monterey. San Francisco Bay is now part of California. 

Portola also saw a lake at the mouth of the San Joaquin River. Although it was not named until 1852, this lake is now called San Francisco Bay. 

San Francisco is a beautiful city with many hills. The San Francisco National Cemetery is in the hills overlooking the city. The cemetery is the resting place for soldiers who died in the US and foreign wars. There are also cemeteries for sailors and marines as well as war heroes from the city of San Francisco. 

Despite all the hills San Francisco still lies on the coast of California. The Golden Gate is a famous gateway to the city. It was built as a mechanism to keep out the sea but now tourists use it too. 

San Francisco has many parks and buildings along the water. The cable car to the summit of Mount Tamalpais is an iconic San Francisco sight. Many people ride the cable car in the Summer. 

The Golden Gate Bridge is a famous landmark in San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge spans the entrance to San Francisco Bay between the US and Marin counties. The Golden Gate Bridge was opened to"," The Portola Expedition was followed by many other expeditions that explored the area. One of the most famous explorers was Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo who visited the area in 1542. He named it ""San Francisco"" after Saint Francis of Assisi. San Francisco was then inhabited by Native Americans. They didn't like the European arrival very much so a large number of them fled the area. During the Gold Rush years the population doubled. Nowadays San Francisco is well known for its tourism, art, food and wine. It is sometimes referred to as ""The City that Never Sleeps"". 

In my opinion the first sentence could be: San Francisco is a small town on the coast of California. The second sentence could say: San Francisco lies on the coast of California. I also think the last sentence could be changed to: San Francisco is sometimes referred to as ""The City that Never Sleeps"".


I prefer sentence 3 due to its readability and grammatical correctness.


The third sentence can be further improved by using more verbs, for example ""It is sometimes referred to as ""The City that Never Sleeps""."", or ""It is referred to as The City that Never Sleeps."". However, the sentence is grammatically correct. The only grammatical error is that the verb ""seem"" should be used instead of ""seem to"". ""Seem"" expresses a feeling whereas ""seem to"" expresses"," It was the Russian fur trader, Karluk and his crew that first saw the land in 1770. It was not until 1776 that a Russian ship with a more permanent presence, the Arcángel, made land in the territory now known as San Francisco. The area that now comprise of the city of San Francisco was not incorporated into the state of California until 1855. The Portola expedition is credited with giving the name 'Alta California' to the vast region that would later become the state of California. Portola established a trading post on San Francisco's Sutter's Creek. In 1841 the settlement of San Francisco grew from a few houses to nearly 5,000 and became the largest city in California. San Francisco grew even more quickly after the Gold Rush of 1848. During the next forty years the city grew in leaps and bounds expanding to over 12,000 in ten square miles. Overcrowding and poor water quality led the city to look towards aqueducts to bring clean water to the city. As a result of these issues, San Francisco grew a second city called Oakland to the south. Many businesses moved to Oakland. By the 1880's, San Francisco had become a city of 60,000 people. In addition, a third city, called Sacramento, had grown up around the new aqueducts. During this period of rapid growth there were no municipal parks. All the open space was owned by the individual business or homeowner. A local activist"," Gaspar de Portola marched his men along the coastal bluff and onto the land that is now called Alcatraz. He named the town San Francisco and this became the name that the area has today. Portola founded the settlement that lasted only a few years. The reason San Francisco San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California is because another explorer named John Charles Fremont redirected the water of a river to flow into the bay creating a harbour where the city now stands. 

The prompt gives some guidance for writing the story using the following headings. The first heading is titled “San Francisco” and gives you some context about why San Francisco lies on the California coastline. The second heading is titled “alcatraz” and is where you describe where Alcatraz is located. The third heading is titled “The Portola Expedition” and describes the expedition led by Gaspar de Portola. The final heading is titled “John Charles Fremont” and tells the story of the redirection of a river that created the harbour where San Francisco now stands.

  1. Gaspar de Portola led a Spanish expedition that first saw San Francisco in 1769 on the coast of northern California.  
  2. Although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour, San Francisco was discovered by land rather than by sea.  
  3. Gaspar de Portola led a Spanish expedition that marched his men along the coastal bluff and onto the land"," This is a testament to how well planned Portola's expedition was as he led a group of 70 men, 10 oxen and 300 horses through the thick wilderness. Over the next 10 years a town was slowly cultivated and it was officially incorporated in 1847. The settlement continued to grow and now has over 681,500 people and a population density of more than seven thousand people per square mile. 

Today San Francisco is a major metropolitan area in Northern California and a global financial centre. It has an international airport and is known for its landmarks like the San Francisco Opera House and Golden Gate Bridge. It is well known for its beaches, parks and nightlife. The climate is typically mild with hotter days and cool nights. San Francisco is also known to be very walkable. It is well connected by public transport and has light rail and BART which runs all over the city. 

San Francisco is very safe. There is an aggressive policing and court system and a very friendly and helpful population of people. The main languages spoken are English, Chinese Mandarin, and Japanese. San Francisco is also well known for its food. You will find many of American and Chinese food in restaurants and grocery. 

San Francisco is a very progressive and modern city. One may find trendy boutiques, hipster coffee shops and restaurants. The city is vibrant and has many festivals and events. The best part is that many of the events and festivals are free. 

There are a"," This was due to the steep coastal hills leading to the bay.


San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769.


Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. This was due to the steep coastal hills leading to the bay.

In 1770 Portola and a group of soldiers and settlers led by Alessandro Parrocco, Alonzo Chavez, and Juan Castrillón constructed a small fort and named it Mission San Francisco de Assisi. This fort still stands today and is now a city-owned museum and tourist attraction.


Two years later Mission San Francisco de Assisi was followed by Mission Dolores and Mission San Francisco Apolinar, both built by Father Junípero Serra. This is because Portola had not been led by a vision from God which had been required to build the first two missions. He simply was convinced that this new land was the right place to found a new Christian mission.

Over the years more churches, many mission churches were built to serve the growing Catholic population in Alta California. San Francisco grew to be a flourishing port with a bustling population.


Eventually San Francisco became a municipality in 1847 and two more missions were constructed, Mission Santa Cruz and Mission San Rafael."," Portola's party travelled from Monterey up the coast to the place they named Alta California, which they thought meant High California. However what Portola and his men came to call San Francisco is today the name we use for Los Angeles. This is because Portola's men did not go further inland or up the coast, as they had only gone as far as the place they named Alta California. Their map showed the name San Francisco, but they did not realise it was Portola's birthplace. Because the area was so new and so well explored by this time, it had no name. In 1774, Francisco de Borja was sent by the Spanish colonial government to explore the region and named it Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles y San Francisco. This name has remained to this day. A year later Portola returned with supplies and found the name of San Francisco already knew by other people, so he renamed the settlement what it is today: Los Angeles. The discovery of San Francisco by Portola and the recognition and subsequent name change by Borja occurred in 1769 and 1774, which is also known as year one.

There are even stamp art competitions which you can take part in. All you have to do is look in your mailbox to find a beautiful stamp in your postage paper. The problem is that the amount of stamps in circulation increases every year and as a result people have less stamps to collect. But that doesn’t mean you have to wait until you are completely out of stamps to start collecting, now there are different ways you can do that. For example you can order special stamps from the website: www.usps.com. You can visit the Post Office on different days to get the stamp that is valid on that day.

" It was the BBC. But there's something I learnt from it too: it's OK to ask for help, and we need to try and live more ethically because of the size of the world we live in. So in 2016 I signed up to a one-man mission to live as ethically as possible. I set myself a single rule: no more plastics. And so I went Plastic-Free January and felt a bit awkward at first. Then I got used to not using plastic things. In fact I got used to not using things like plastic bags, straws, cutlery, bottles, containers, etc. It wasn't always possible but I still went on holiday, went to parties etc. And I made friends with others in a similar position to me, so it was OK. It was even quite funny. But there was one part of my life that was difficult. I couldn't stop myself using plastic water bottles. I didn't understand that to some people it might not be ethical to use plastic water bottles. So I gave it some thought and then I realised why. Plastic water bottles are easy to use, don't break easily so they're an obvious choice. They're also less expensive than glass water bottles so they make economic sense. So I stopped buying plastic bottles and started looking for other ways to water my plants. Now I'm not perfect. I still use plastic straws for drinks. But overall I'm happy with my progress. I can"," The BBC wanted to find out what living ethically actually meant, so I set off on a year-long odyssey to try and find out. I started with a crash course in ethics:
  - read a story about ethics 
  - watched a short educational video 
  - read a story about ethics that was longer than the ones I'd read before 
  - did an exercise about ethics 
  - wrote an essay about ethics 
  - did an experiment that involved ethical decisions 
  - took a trip to a ethical company 
  - watched a documentary about ethics 
  - wrote an essay on ethics 
  - discussed ethics with a friend 
  - read a book that discussed ethics

  The car recycling wine bottles is an ethical mistake. Plastic bags are better than paper bags because they don't end up in landfills and are easier to recycle. Plastic bags are also more expensive and therefore harder to give up. 

One mistake does not make an ethical mistake. Plastic bags are more expensive are harder to give up because they are better and therefore car recycling wine bottles are not an ethical mistake.

  Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. Growing up in the 1990s in Hong Kong I never thought I'd be doing the BBC's"," When the BBC advertised for someone to come up with a headline to go with my profile of me - 'Ethical Man - BBC's Ethical Journalist' - I didn't bat an eyelid. I was, after all, after the headline, anything else didn't really matter. I'm not particularly ethical, I think we all know that, but if I was an ethical person, that's exactly what I'd want the BBC to be known for. The BBC approached me about doing this four years ago, I was keen to get started as they promised to provide plenty of challenges, but it soon became clear I would have to sacrifice my car for a year. My first challenge was to give up the car - I've always relied on the car for everything - so it was an uphill struggle. But, I gave up the car in November 2015 and you will have noticed I haven't used plastic bags since. I've also stopped drinking wine bottles - not sure that has been quite the same struggle, but I've given it my best shot. It's not all been plain sailing though. I've made a few rookie mistakes, like putting the bins out at night when I was exhausted, and, in the early days, getting too busy and forgetting to recycle. But over the last year, I've made good progress and the most exciting thing has been seeing the response of the public. I can report that in my more than 3 million Google searches, there hasn't been a"," That came from a friend who works at the broadcaster. In April this year, I attended an event where senior figures from the BBC and its parent company, the British Broadcasting Corporation, were giving media briefings. As part of my role at the BBC, I've previously had the opportunity to attend such events but - as I'm sure you can appreciate - this was my first time in the hot seat, giving media briefings on a topic that was my own idea. To be honest, my first reaction was one of relief that my colleague had booked the slot rather than me. She's a far better liar than me and could quite happily spend the day telling you how awesome my idea was. So, having arrived at the Broadcasting House, I entered the auditorium hoping for a seat near the front. Instead, I was greeted by a sight that would haunt me for years to come. There were hundreds of empty seats, some standing room only, and I was the only journalist from the BBC who was not onscreen giving my briefing. After a short break for coffee and biscuits, I was back onscreen next to a man I recognised as my colleague. We began the briefing by explaining that I'd suggested to the BBC that it should become an ethical employer, that is, put the interest of its employees ahead of that of shareholders. As you can imagine, this was met with incredulity and some raised their hands in protest, indicating that they did not share my opinion."," In fact I didn't realise there was a BBC's ethical man until a reporter told me there was one. But I suppose you could say living ethically means a lot of things. For example I'm avoiding plastic shopping bags because if they're not there I won't use plastic bags. I'm not recycling coffee cups because they'll end up in the landfill, and I'm not using plastic straws because they are actually worse for you than the plastic cups. Ethically maybe I'm giving up plastic straws, though. So that's living ethically. It's never an easy path but I like to think I'm learning as I go along. For now, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the people in the BBC who do ethical things, from production designers to engineers to the people who write the programmes. That's a lot of people. They really are a credit to the BBC. 
[..]
It was during my year of trial and error that I realised living ethically isn't all about avoiding straws. I was having a great time with friends. We travelled to new places. It would have been unthinkable for me to miss the party because I'd forgotten to collect my straw. I was living ethically. But what about when I went running at 7.30 in the morning to avoid using a plastic water bottle? I'd rather not say. That wasn't ethical, that was me struggling with an unfamiliar lifestyle. I"," I'm actually the BBC's worst prank caller. I like to make people laugh and I like to be clever. In my experience, people like to be laughed at, especially if they are being a prat in the way they do something basic like recycle. After all I probably am a prat when I put the bags in the bin. So I thought I'd see how long it would take for the Recycle Wine bottles website to find someone who was happy to put their bottle in the recycle bin. Unfortunately though, I was still getting some odd responses - like one guy who seemed to be genuinely confused about what I was asking and another guy who was so keen to get his bottle into the bin that he accidentally dropped it and broke his glass. As the weeks went by and there was still no end in sight to my deadline to find an 'ethical man' to impersonate, I began to think that maybe I wasn't cut out for this job. But just as I was about to give up, something amazing happened. A week before the end of my one year deadline I received an email. I had done an online test for this Recycle Wine bottles charity. The charity needed someone to represent them on the online forum. The test asked me some simple questions - something like - How much should the bottle be paid? Is it illegal to throw bottles away in some countries? Should I pay to have them recycled? Am I being a bit of a prat?"," I didn't go looking for this job. I'm currently on a year's sabbatical working in a soup kitchen. I'm just the token ethical person. And I've learned my lesson - next time, I will do all my recycling at home! I started off by asking other Ethical Men for advice on how to become the best ethical person possible. One comment stuck with me - 'you need to find a way to give pleasure to people around you without causing them harm'. Now, I want my family to feel good, too, and that's why I only use glass bottles and recycle plastic bags. But I want to make the world a better place, too, and that's why I avoid using plastic straws, eating in restaurants and wearing leather. I hope my journey will encourage you to ask your friends what it means to live ethically. And now, on with the ethics: I don't use plastic bags!... I don't use straws!... I only eat in restaurants when the chef has considered what impact food will have on the environment!... And I wear leather!... Now it's your turn - are you living ethically?  

Hi - I'm Justin Rowlatt and I'm the BBC's 'Ethical Man'. I try to avoid using plastic straws, eating in restaurants when the chef has considered what impact food will have on the environment and wearing leather. I'm not sure I'm living ethically!

" We were the first women to hold a vigil at the prison. 

The story can be a poem, a blog post, a video, or anything else that comes to mind.
This is a powerful movement that has happened in every state in the union.  Prisoners have been organizing while in prison to demand their basic rights.  They created committees to address the human rights issues they were facing while incarcerated.  They have been filing lawsuits to get compensation for their suffering while incarcerated.  And they have been campaigning for and voting in protest elections to demand changes in society.
These efforts have been led by the prisoners ofcolor movement.  This group of people of color are locked up at higher rates than people of color who aren't in prison.  They are calling for an end to structural racism in our justice system and for more equitable sentencing.  They have been fighting for better access to legal counsel, adequate medical treatment, job training, and basic amenities.
The prisoners ofcolor movement has pushed for prison reform, restorative justice, mental health supports, and education for youth of color who are in prison.  They have brought attention to the gross racial disparities in the justice system.  They have won some basic rights for themselves, but the fight continues for full equality. 

There is so much power in solidarity and in uniting with others to demand change.  You can join in solidarity by sharing this movement with your networks.  Ask friends and family"," All the women brought food: beans, rice, sweet potatoes, plantains, peanuts, sweet sorghum and bananas. 

The story your students will read about the campaign to free the sons in prison is:

	We went to the park to dance. We chanted and lit fifty-two candles. People came to hear our message and brought food for our picnic. We grew to fifty women who brought loads of food. Our picnic made the news and helped to free the sons in prison.

	Our campaign to free the sons in prison was a success. People stopped to look and brought food for our picnic. We danced and chanted to the beat of the drum. Our drumming worked! People came to our picnic and we grew to fifty-two women, the perfect number. All the food we brought was eaten. Our picnic was a success!

	The story your students read about the campaign to free the sons in prison is clear and concise. The language is simple, direct, and inclusive of all characters in the story. The story includes concrete details that provide context to the main action. The story conveys the excitement your group felt when the action resulted in success. The overall tone of the text is uplifting.

	We went to the park to dance. We chanted and lit fifty-two candles. People came to hear our message and brought food for our picnic. By the time it was dark our picnic had grown to more than","

We knew fifty-two names of the imprisoned sons of our city. We visited their prisons one by one. We put up a light in the prison yard for each son. People came to ask about our campaign. It was dark before our camp had grown to fifty women.

The next day, while I was preparing to teach, a friend asked me: 'Sister, why are you lighting the houses of the prisoners? What is your plan? You are not in prison, and even if you were, you still have all the rights of a citizen of Bongoland.'

  * The campaign included: -
    * Fifty-two women from other cities who organised a vigil in support of the campaign
    * Fifty-two Bongolandis in prison who organised a candle-lit vigil outside their prisons to raise awareness about their incarceration.
    * Fifty-two men from other cities who organised vigils in their honour outside their offices.

  * The women from other cities also participated in the campaign and gathered at the prisons, dressed in black like mourning widows in attendance to a funeral and lighting candles to honour the imprisoned men.

  * My friend's comment made me realise that I had not anticipated my actions in the preceeding days, and my actions were not solely in line with my intentions.

  * I re-examine the goal and purpose of the campaign: to raise awareness about the imprisonment of fifty-two"," 

The story should include an explanation of the campaign (what is it and who is involved) and details of the camp (where and when it took place). A picture would be great, but not required. You may draw on the experience you have been leading up to this point.

The story must make clear that a campaign has been going on for many months and that many women have joined the circle of lights. The women who stop by to see your activities and who ask about the campaign are likely to have heard of the campaign and are probably very interested in it. 

Your role in the story will be to: 

Explain the campaign to the reader
Delineate the details of the campaign and what it is
Convey the excitement and importance of the campaign to the reader

Your final story should be no more than 2000 words.

On a tour of the Sunningdale Conference Centre, Bucknor discovers that the entire centre is based on a real hotel:

“It was an old hotel that had been converted to a conference centre, but the conversion was so convincing that it fooled Bucknor. The only thing the film made explicit about the Sunningdale Hotel was that it was next to a local school.” (source: www.imdb.com/title/tt4066131/reviews)

The grade level is based on the words per sentence, words per sentence - sentence length and words per sentence - Grade Level correlation from the American technology company, Flesch, and the American writer, Kincaid. The correlation values range between 0 (completely illogical) and 100 (completely logical). 

Here are the results for the prompt given above: 
words per sentence: 19.86
words per sentence - sentence length: 2.26
words per sentence - Grade Level correlation: 0.32

These results show that the text is moderately difficult to understand. The correlation value for words per sentence - sentence length is quite low, however, correlation values can be improved by shortening the sentences or by adding new sentences in the text.

In 1893 a derby was held for the first Iditarod Sled Race. It was a small wooden sled the teams had to pull with reindeer skin sled runners.  There were seven teams and one was the Iditarod Club of America which was made up of all the wealthiest people in the area and the winner of the derby.

The weather turned bad and the race was called off but the Iditarod Club of America won and the first Iditarod was held in the spring of 1894.

In 1895 when the Iditarod finished the first Iditarod had covered 25,000 miles and was the longest running annual event in America.

Over the years the race was not held in the winter so the event grew and grew but today it's a tourist attraction in Anchorage which has over 700 feet of snow and over 200,000 people attend every year.

There are several stories to tell about the Iditarod and I hope you have as much fun reading them as I had writing them.

"," The gold rush was on. In 1903, a young man from Massachusetts by the name of Teddy Green, who had recently made a fortune selling matches, decided to enter the Iditarod race to see if he could beat a local man named Alexi Sperdjian. Teddy Green came to Alaska and built a very large dog sled team. The race began. Teddy Green's dog team was faster but Alexi Sperdjian pulled a second dog team with a sled made of reindeer antlers which was faster. Teddy Green was not happy. In the race that followed, Teddy Green's team broke down many times and had to be resupplied. Teddy Green lost his cool and was arrested and sent back to Massachusetts. The race was called off and the Iditarod race was over. People from Alaska loved Teddy Green for his enthusiasm and tenacity but they hated him because he had stolen their sport. The Iditarod race has continued annually ever since.

  * The race that Teddy Green entered was called the Iditarod. The race was a dog sled race between two teams.

  * The Iditarod race began in 1903.

  * Teddy Green was a young man from Massachusetts.

  * The race was called the Iditarod.

  * Alexi Sperdjian was a local man.

  * The race was called off because Teddy Green's team broke down.

  * Teddy Green was not happy"," The town was founded by people fleeing the famine in Eastern Europe. Over the next few decades the weather would prove to be a powerful force in shaping the town. One year the temperatures would drop so low that people would have to wear special suits in order to walk around town. Over time the town would grow rich and famous because of the Iditarod race. The race takes competitors dog sled into the icy sea, where they have to complete a racecourse in the shortest time. In 1896, Mikhail Mishalovich became the first athlete to finish the Iditarod. A few years later, Adolphus 'Skip' Selfridge also became the first person to finish the race twice. It was also in 1897 that Adolphus 'Ducky' Alberts set a record by covering the Iditarod in 5 days 7 hours 35 minutes. This would remain the record for over 30 years until it was broken in 1947 by Bill Duff. Throughout the years Iditarod grew to have many fans in the USA and the world. Today the Iditarod is still an annual sporting event. 
THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH
The race was named in 1896 as the 'Dog Sled Grand National', but is better known as the 'Iditarod' today. The Iditarod was originally a local sports competition, though it was not until 1897 that a racecourse was built"," It was the first city to which all natives from the region had flocked in the hopes of finding gold. It was also the site of a slaughter house and other industries. During the first 20 years of the town's existence it was plagued with disease and crime so it was renamed Denali after the most northern mountain in America. Despite all the tribulations the town continued to prosper and grew further each year. However, in 1913 a severe blizzard struck the town and destroyed many of the buildings and crops. The town was left with nothing. The natives of the region did not fare much better. They were left destitute and without any means to survive. The two groups of people would never live together again. However, during the blizzard a brave young Native man climbed to the top of a mountain called Denali and sent a message to the rest of the people of Iditarod asking for help. The message said that anyone who came to Iditarod to help the people would be well rewarded.  People came from all over the world and helped set up a tent city. They worked tirelessly building roads, bridges and schools. Slowly but surely the people of Iditarod grew back their city and business started to flourish again. However, for the Native people of the region, things were very much not well. The people of Iditarod had no wish to see the Native people well-being returned. Instead they chose to persecute the people of the region and attempt"," Soon a race to find the mine became a'sport' as people competed to see who could be the first to reach the gold. The race was called Iditarod for this reason. One man from this region was named Ted Schieffelin. In 1887 he decided to enter the Iditarod race. He spent 3 years preparing, training and building a dog sled. In 1892 he set off and immediately caught up with the other runners. He had been traveling for 18 days, compared to other competitors who had traveled for 30. His dog sled was faster than most and he was the first to reach the gold mine in what is now the most northern state of USA Alaska. The race was called Iditarod for this reason. Ted's dog sled team became known as the Last Great Race on Earth.  The Iditarod is still a competitive event for dogsled racers today and is held in early February every year.

  

Iditarod is a competitive event for dogsled racers today and is held in early February every year. Ted Schieffelin, from the region named Iditarod, had been traveling for three years to get ready to compete in the race, and was the first to reach the gold mine,  in what is now the most northern state of USA Alaska. The Iditarod is still a competitive event for dogsled racers, and the race was named after his successful team.

  

  
"," The Iditarod was not much of a town. It had only a few hundred people.  Many of the townsfolk had come to Iditarod hoping to get rich. Iditarod was built near the gold fields.  

A man named Nathanial Chantles (fictitious) came to Iditarod. He was a famous surgeon from San Francisco. He became well known for repairing the eyesight of blind people. He became famous and people from everywhere came to Iditarod to see and be seen by Nathanial Chantles.  

Nathanial Chantles decided to have his own show. He traveled with many of his blind friend to Iditarod and people would come to watch. Nathanial Chantles performed surgery on the audience. He removed their blindfolds and the people could see and cheer for the surgeons who could perform such surgery. Iditarod was very prosperous during Nathanial Chantles reign and it was he and the townsfolk that made it so. 

Nathanial Chantles decided he wanted to be king. So he and the townsfolk created a new religion. They would follow Nathanial Chantles and all his commands. Nathanial Chantles created a new holy book and they had a temple built to God, Nathanial Chantles and all the people from Iditarod worshipped God. 

Things went well for a while. The people of Iditar"," This was because the people lived far from everything. The people in Iditarod mostly lived in tiny single-room homes built from wood or sod. 

In the late 1800s there was a great migration from Europe to the USA for people looking for work. Millions of people left Europe in search of a better life. The large number of people in the mid-west led to a great rise in food production. The USA, with it's vast agricultural land, became the leading country in the world producing food. 

Many of the people who moved to Alaska in the 1880s were miners. These people would go down into deep holes in the earth in search of valuable minerals. In 1882 the richest gold mine in the USA was located in what is now called Nome, Alaska. The gold was to be found in the frozen ocean waters of the Bering Strait, only a few days travel to the south. 

Because the gold mine was so promising the people in Nome went wild, there was great celebration and a rush to town to be part of the excitement. Many of the miners in Nome soon lost everything, but kept going down into the holes in the earth, looking for more gold.

The miners in Nome were followed by hunters who came to hunt caribou. These animals became scarce when the weather turned cold. The hunters eventually gave up their hunt and returned to Nome. They decided to use some of the gold the miners had"

" Since then, Ben has become the bestest drummer ever. 
  
Rock Band is a band toy that lets you play guitar, bass, and drums on computer or through a wireless Bluetooth controller. It received a lot of backlash from the music community for the way it handled the copyright infringement issue but sold out at launch. The latest version released in the US is Rock Band 4.


We played 'Happy Birthday' to Ben in the music store. His friends and family were blown away by how well he played.


In the end, we had to admit to ourselves that Ben had been right all along. It's better than television and computer games.


Ben is now the bestest drummer in the entire world


Rock Band is indeed better than television and computer games.


Ben, you are the bestest drummer in the world.


Ben is now our son.


Ben, you are now the bestest drummer in the entire world.


As I said earlier, the music community was not thrilled about Rock Band but it sold out at launch.


So we played 'Happy Birthday' to Ben in the music store.


Ben loved the drum set. He plays all the songs from the guitar album already.


And now he's the bestest drummer in the world


The music community was not thrilled about Rock Band but it sold out at launch.


So we played 'Happy Birthday' to"," We had never been particularly well-off and this was his birthday money so of course we had to do it. 
  When the package arrived we were impressed. Not only was it more than we had hoped for, it was also way more than Ben had asked for. Even though we weren't much good at drumming we were determined to give it a go. Ben said he'd be our teacher and would give us lessons. 
  So we set to work. First we asked Ben if we should buy sticks or buy a set of sticks that already came with a drum skin. He said it didn't matter and we should buy drum sticks. 
  Next we decided what kit to buy. We liked the Yamaha DTX-7 we had already used. It was very affordable, so we'd have enough money for more drum kits in the future, it had very good reviews and it had some cool features like an external trigger button. 
  We decided to buy a drum skin, a stand, a snare drum, a toms drum and a cymbal. A few days later Ben arrived with his drums and we started practicing. We were nervous, we were new and we didn't know what to expect. We couldn't believe our eyes when our drumming turned out much better than Ben's, the drums had a deep deep groove and very nice resonance.
After only a few months of practicing we could really see our improvement. We were able to keep up"," When the drums arrived he was delighted. We made a point of spending a lot of time practising the songs that he knows by heart. Each drum hit is like another dollar in the bank we hope.

After a few weeks of lessons, Ben's attitude had changed. He wasn't interested in drumming at all anymore. The noise, the way it got into all of our habit, the way it distracted us from doing the things we really wanted to was now a big turn-off. The drum kit stayed packed away in the corner of the room. There was an uncomfortable silence in the family. We didn't know what to do. 

After a while, the drums started to sound a lot less important. We eventually gave in and put them aside to be forgotten. 

After 2 years, Ben's 14 year old self came back into the room and asked for the drums back. 'What's changed?' we asked him. 'Nothing' came the reply. 'I still don't like them and I still want the drums back.' We sighed and gave in again.

But then something magical happened. 

The same day, Ben's father went to the local hardware store and bought himself an acoustic kit. He then asked us if we could borrow the drums to play along with him. 

From that moment on, the drums again started to take up a lot of our free time. We started to play along with the family in our spare time"," 
  When the drums arrived we were amazed at the quality of the hardware. The shells were beautiful and all painted with the band's logo. The drumheads and heads were extremely clean and looked new. After putting them together we gave Ben his birthday present - a happy drummer.

This is the passage:

Rock Band Two years ago our 14-year-old son Ben asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first we were very much against the idea because of the noise. ""It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time"" Ben argued ""and it'll keep me out of trouble."" In the end we gave in. When the drums arrived we were amazed at the quality of the hardware. The shells were beautiful and all painted with the band's logo. The drumheads and heads were extremely clean and looked new. After putting them together we gave Ben his birthday present - a happy drummer.

","The next day we saw a sale at H&M and got him a set of drums for just 99 crowns.The set looked and sounded terrible. Ben immediately started to practice, and after a while it didn't seem so bad anymore.After three weeks, we had completely forgotten about the drums. One evening, Ben went to his room and started to bang on the walls. We couldn't hear anything at first, but after a while we could hear distinct bangs in several rooms of the house. We raced down the stairs and saw that all the walls of the living room had already started to shake. At that moment, Ben collapsed on the floor. We were a little relieved at first, but soon we started to worry.The following days were a complete waste of time. Ben refused to go to school, and spent his time playing the drums. After a couple of weeks, we were worried that the set of drums had been broken. One evening, we saw that one of the legs of the stand had been broken off. We decided that the drums were useless and threw them out with the rest of Ben's garbage after he had gone to school the next morning.

Ben's story is a great example of how the learning opportunities provided by new technology are not always well used, and how we can promote learning in new and different ways.

  * In the story, Ben argued “It’s better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time.” This"," 'Okay' I said, 'but you have to promise to only use them for practice, and only on the driveway and at home.' 

Ben was very happy with his drums and even started practicing at home. 

I knew him to be a good boy and that's why I was a bit shocked when this weekend he arrived at our house with a set of loud, and rather hard to control, plastic drums. I asked him why he had those in his possession. 

'They were given to me by a friend, whose child has the exact same model of drum, and so I thought I should get one too.' 

'I think you can still hear them from the hallway. We'll talk to them tomorrow.' I said, trying to hide my disappointment, but Ben wasn't having it. 

'No way, they are not going anywhere. I'll practice even more, you won't see those anymore.' And with that he disappeared back into his room. 

The next morning I went down to the garage to borrow a hacksaw to try and get the drums to make a bit of noise. The drums were still where I had left them. 

'Great. Now I have to go to a shop to get new drums, my parents will kill me, and I have practice tomorrow too. 

I hate this rock 'n' roll stuff.' 

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a rating for"," I asked our local drum shop to order us a set of drums and accessories for Ben. We were a little apprehensive about how the noise would be when the drum set arrived, but we weren't prepared for the shock when the UPS man showed up with a giant box of drums and an accompanying noticeably loud drum kit! The noise did indeed sound a lot worse than we'd anticipated. We put the kit together, trying to ignore the noise as much as we could and put the drums in our basement. A couple of days laterthe UPS man showed up again, with another box of gear. We were pretty excited, but as we started unloading the second box we noticed the box we'd received the first time from the UPS man was missing. We called the store but they said we could only get a refund on the drums we already had (even though we'd specifically asked them to ship us an extra box). Not wanting to waste any more of our father-in-law's hard-earned money on a useless drum set, we gave it away. Then a month laterBen's dad surprised him with a new, more silent set of drums. He's since decided he prefers the noisy set. Even though we'd only intended to buy the drums for a month, it turns out it's been one of the best month's ever since the moment we unwrapped them!

Her recent records include a new Guinness World Record for deepest breath held without opening her mouth (265.8 metres), and also for longest continuous free dive (240.0 metres).

She went into the ocean as deep as 176 metres and returned up to the surface with only one breath of air. Tanya has now set five world records in free-diving and holds three of them. She currently lives in Miami and is a competitive diver. 

Tanya is known for being extremely flexible and has many stories of how this has helped her in diving. She is a certified scuba diver and freediver and has dived in many extreme environments around the world, including the North Pole, the bottom of the ocean (the Challenger Deep), under the ice in Antarctica, and a cave in Romania. She holds three world records in free-diving, one for reaching 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and then coming back up to the top, another for reaching 176 metres into the ocean and coming back up with only one breath of air, and a third for the deepest freedive ever conducted, reaching a maximum depth of 280 metres and returning up to the surface with only one breath of air. 

Tanya is a very inspiring woman with a positive attitude, and is also the co-host of a podcast with her husband called The Dive Quiz.

Use the following supporting details to tell the story of Tanya Streeter:

  * She holds four world records in free-diving. What are they? 
"," She then went on to win three more world records in 2004, 2005, and 2007. In 2008 she became the first person to hold all four world records. Tanya's impressive athletic career began in 1995 when she joined the U.S. Army's Special Forces. She holds a degree in business administration from Florida State University and is married to Mark Streeter who runs an IT consultancy. The couple has a daughter and live in Cape Coral, Florida.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is a readability scale based on the words being read at a particular grade level. Grade 2 learners typically are not reading at a college level. Tanya Streeter's accomplishment is best conveyed by the context provided in the prompt.

"," 

In 2015 Tanya Streeter set three more records when she became the first person to dive 260 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and come back up to the top without help. 

In 2017 Tanya Streeter set her fourth world record when she became the first person to dive 425 metres into the ocean while holding her breath and come back up to the top without help.


These records are due to several factors including her rigorous training regimen, her low tolerance for ambient air and the depth to which she can dive.


In terms of depth, this is a sport that is especially suited to Tanya Streeter due to the unique physiology needed to dive deep while holding your breath.  The pressure at the depth she dives is equivalent to 3-4 kilograms of weight resting on top of the kidneys. 

Tanya Streeter holds the records for having the deepest single breath held with a world-leading 10 metres, the deepest triple breath held with a world-leading 25 metres and the deepest dive to a depth of 120 metres into the ocean without the use of air.


She is also the first person to dive 300 metres below the surface of the ocean, which is also the deepest spot ever recorded at 50 meters.


Tanya Streeter continues to hold world records every year as she trains harder and harder.


Tanya Streeter has been free-diving since she was a little girl and started training when she was 5 years"," In 2005 she also made history by breaking the women’s world record for deepest free-dive at 118 metres, when she went near-blind diving at 104 metres. But her most astonishing feat may be that in 2008, at age 17, she made her own world record for deepest free-dive ever recorded at 119 metres, which is considered an extreme feat by any measure. 

Why does Tanya Streeter hold these world records? She was inspired to become a free-diver when a former teacher broke his own world record by going deeper than Tanya Streeter ever did, so she knew she could also achieve her own goal. What really sets her apart though, is not only is she extremely well-trained in the sport of free-diver, but she is extremely well-balanced as well. She regularly practices yoga and runs marathons as a team member of a cross-country running team.

In addition to being a free-diver, Tanya is also a competitive water-sports competitor and world-champion long-distance triathlete. Tanya has also started to write her autobiography and is hoping to release it as early as 2021.


Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving the sport in which competitors reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. 

In 2003 Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding"," Two years later in 2005 she broke the Guiness World Record for 'greatest number of metres dived on one breath of air' - holding her breath for 120 metres. The following year Tanya Streeter broke both the Guiness World and European Records for 'deepest depth dived on one breath of air', going as deep as 150 metres. Since then she has gone on to hold seven more world records, all of which are held with one breath of air. Tanya Streeter lives in Florida, United States, and is an official FINA Diving Coach.

The fox was fed delicacies by the servant who cared for it. The fox had become tame and enjoyed watching the birds and the rabbits in a cage nearby. The servant began to stroke the fox's ears and tail, as it was very slow to learn commands. The fox became upset and tried to attack the servant. The servant quickly removed the fox from its cage and brought it into the main part of the zoo. 

The fox was placed in a spacious enclosure and given plenty of food and water. There was plenty of space for it to run around and see the other animals. The servant returned every day to check on the fox's progress. It was learning to behave very quickly.


One day, the fox saw a snake coming out of its hole. The fox decided it was a great opportunity to prove its ferocity and attack the snake. The snake began to hiss and strike the air to warn others. The fox ignored the warning and pounced on the snake. The snake hissed and tried to protect itself but the","


Some of the reasons people stop keeping animals in zoos are that they are tired of the routine, they do not like the looks of the animals, or the animals are too small. In most zoos animals are kept in small, dark areas and cannot see much. If they do manage to spot something interesting they may not be able to move fast enough to see it or might be too frightened to leave their comfort zone. Also, some of the animals do not form strong relationships with their keepers.


The best zoo animals are those that are free to choose how to behave. If they are let free in their habitat they will naturally look around for the things that interest them and interact with each other. They will not be so focused on performing for the visitors as they would in a zoo with no opportunity to behave naturally.


One interesting animal that people have kept as a zoo animal is the orangutan. Orangutans are known to be a very social species and they will form strong relationships with their keepers. They do not speak but they can understand simple spoken messages and can tell when they are being spoken to. It is believed that they have large areas designated for resting in at the sanctuary but, they can still be found wandering around the grounds of the zoo. They are generally seen in groups of three to four with one male and one female.


When kept in captivity orangutans have very poor health, their diet is not"," However, some animals still are taught to perform and it is up to the visitors to decide if they want to watch the animal perform or whether they prefer to visit the zoo to walk around and enjoy the view. In recent years this has led to a growing debate about whether animals should be allowed to perform in zoos. For example one person who believes that animals should not perform is Gary Hume an Irish actor and musician. He performed in a recent television advertisement for a company that manufactures animal cages. In this advertisement Gary Hume plays a wildlife expert who tells the audience that wild animals are often stressed by having to perform and that they need to be able to express themselves freely in order to be healthy. However, there are many others who believe that animals should be allowed to perform in zoos. For example the actor Samuel L. Jackson who believes that it is important for people to experience what it is like to watch wild animals perform in order to understand their behaviour and to ensure that these animals are not persecuted by activists who believe that performing is unnecessary. The debate about whether animals should perform in zoos will no doubt continue. It will be interesting to see which side prevails in the end. Gary Hume might argue that he is right because he was able to perform in the advertisement while many opponents of animal performance might point to other situations in which animal performance is prohibited and so this argument could be used to show that a ban on animal performance is justified. However, for the purposes of this story","

One popular animal at most zoos is thelioncynos. Thelioncynos are the smallest of the species of lion and live in a tree in the jungle but can be quickly moved to a cage when guests wish to see them. Thelioncynos will spend up to 20 minutes per request of the guest looking out of the top of their cage.

While thelioncynos is one animal popular at most zoos, there are many other animals at many zoos including big cats, bears, monkeys, penguins, reptiles, and birds.

Zoos have many other animals including big cats, bears, monkeys, penguins, reptiles, and birds. 

When considering whether to visit a zoo or not, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is important to consider. The higher the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the easier it is to read. This scale is designed to measure how easy it is to read text using a single score out of 100. 

Zoos are a popular tourist attraction and visitors like to see animals in their natural habitat. While some animals like thelioncynos may need to be moved to accommodate visitors, most animals at most zoos are in a cage. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is 50 with the highest score for easy reading being 100. 

While zoos are a popular tourist attraction, the Flesch-K"," Zoo visitors now include tourists from all over the world. The Animals are well looked after and get a wide variety of food. There is a huge variety of animals at the Zoo including crocodiles, lions, tigers, bears, lemurs, penguins and many other species. 
Most of the animals are in outdoor enclosures. Each animal has its own area and they are visited every day by the keeper. They are also trained to interact with each other. Visitors can watch them eat, groom and play in their daily lives. The experience of visiting the zoo is fascinating and visitors leave knowing more about the species of animal they saw than they did before they came. 
At the Gardens of Intelligence visitors can watch all sorts of animals perform. From lions to penguins they all have an important role in keeping the zoological gardens busy and visitors entertained. 
The gardens also include walkways through open-air aviaries and other areas where birds of different species can be seen and handled. 
The aviaries are used to display rare and endangered species that are difficult to keep in nature. These include hornbills, parrots and penguins. 
At present the Gardens of Intelligence have a very large number of rare and endangered species. Many of them can only be found in zoos. 
At the Gardens of Intelligence visitors can see animals that are not found in mainland China because of the political climate. This includes rare species such as"," Zoomorphs are now kept in zoos but their original job was to make the animals act in shows. In the past, Zoomorphs used to be called Dancers but that name was a reference to the fact that they used to move around on the ground with little balls on their heads. Today, they call them Dancers because they no longer perform any tricks.


The story that you write should include the following elements:
- An introduction explaining the origins of animals in zoos
- An overview of the current state of animals in zoos
- A discussion of the purpose of animals in zoos
- A description of Zoomorphs

Introduction
The origins of animals in zoos remain a topic of great debate and disagreement. What is known is that people began keeping animals in large enough groups to live together in zoos over 3000 years ago in China. The rulers of the Chinese empire opened a massive zoo called “The Gardens of Intelligence” where animals of all kinds were displayed to the public in the hope of inspiring the people to greater feats of engineering and science. However, it is now accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally.

In many of the early zoos, animals were trained to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is now accepted that the purpose of zoos is to"," Zoo keepers now focus on keeping animals healthy.  

The animals in the zoo were very shy at first. The keepers did not expect this. They were afraid of the loud noises and strange noises made by the visitors and they thought they were going back to the wild. This did not happen. Slowly the animals began to open up. The keepers talked to the animals and showed them how they could do different tricks. The animals also learnt from each other. In time all the animals except the lion and the tiger learnt to perform tricks. The lion and the tiger learnt how to hunt with their friends the leopards.  

The tourists are very happy that they have seen these animals and now they want to visit the zoo. The Zoo keeps the animals safe from wild animals and protects them from diseases that the animals can get from the wild.  


Use the following passage of text to give an example of A2 level text.

" Money can be hard to come by. My best friend in school had a single dad who earned a living by working in a factory. He was allowed to take home one pound a week to bring him up. Sometimes it isn't enough. We work hard to earn a lot of money to buy things to keep us going. But what if you didn't earn much money? You could live on one pound a week if that was all you had. This may not be a problem in a country like the UK where there is enough money around for most people. In a poorer country like Sierra Leone money might be a big problem as many people don't have enough to eat. But money can help to keep you going. My best friend in school had a single mum who relied on her small income from a part time job at the petrol station. It didn't always get her everything she needed. Some of the food that she bought would have been enough for one person and she would share the rest with her other children. Without enough money you might have to resort to doing things like eating your old clothes or borrowing some from friends. When money goes, so does a lot of the world's happiness. So my question for you is how much money would you need to be happy? And if you had to start again could you still be happy?

If you have some it lets you do a lot of different things. If you don't have any then having less than a fiver is hard and can mean you don't have enough food or you might get a shock if you don't have enough for your rent or phone and internet charges. Sometimes people can get paid in money and sometimes they prefer a different way to pay like through the bank or a card but there is always money at the end of the chain so in all things we have to exchange money for something else. That can be other money but it can also be food medicine or help. If we all spent our money on things that are not important like chocolate and fags instead then we might get rid of a little in the long run.

  * Money is used to exchange for other things

  * It's a measure of value

  * It can be divided into the pound, dollar or franc

  * There is always a next to the word money

  * Money is useful because it can be exchanged for things like sweets a book or cinema tickets

What is the closest equivalent to a gram of money in the English language?

A sovereign is the closest equivalent to a gram of money.

You can still get a sovereign today in England but you need to show it on a passport or other official document. A sovereign is the last of the gold coins mined in England. This was the price of a gram of gold back in the 12th century.

Sovereigns used to be legal tender but now they are only used as banknotes.

You can exchange a sovereign for goods at a bank or at a cashpoint.

Fictional story: The Curiosity Killer 
There is a well know BBC television series called The Magpies, set in the North of England, that has a tagline ""a modern day retelling of Jane Eyre"". Jane Eyre, a famous English author of the 1800's, is said to have been inspired by the story of a young girl that refused to pay a curator to help her find her long-lost father. 

The story in The Curiosity Killer follows a very similar theme.  

At the outset of the story, protagonist Claire (who is a woman, a rarity in British TV shows) is a recent graduate with a few years of work experience working for a very competitive private client, who happen to be the owners of a number of art galleries, as her day-to-day job. 

Her job is to go to local art galleries to meet their most high priced artists, find out their opinions and suggestions for the gallery's work, and to help make art world connections by developing key relationships.  

She feels that the most effective way to do this is to help art lovers find lost art.

They will be installed over the next few years, no school will be left behind so I’m very happy.

It’s an amazing place as the builders have used wood for the whole thing just like in our old school but it’s also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly. I love it!

On the first day at school, I went to visit a class called the art room. There, I met some of the other new students who all seemed to be excited about art classes. We all took a look around the room and were very impressed by the beautiful artwork on the walls. I asked one of the students how the artwork had been painted and he told me it was recycled newspaper that someone had cut into tiny pieces and then shaken to make paint. I was really surprised by this information and asked him for more details. I saw that some of the artwork on the walls was very similar to what I’d seen before in the shop, so I asked him if the art teacher at his school might be able to help me make a donation of some of the newspaper for the school. He wasn’t sure, but he invited me to visit his school next week to find out more.

Title: Meet Anna and her new school

The story starts with Anna who is a 11-year-old pupil that just moved to a new school. Anna’s new school is a good example of an ‘A2’s school’ because they have used wood throughout the building. It’s an ‘A2’s school’ because they use the latest technology and have an eco-friendly policy.

The text provides the following information about Anna and her new school:
- Anna just moved from her old school to this new school
- Her new school is an ‘A2’s school’ because it uses wood for the building
- The new school has a mini-cinema room, games room and staffroom


This is the beginning of the text, where we provide an introduction to Anna and her new school. The text continues with the rest of the story.


The story continues with Anna’s first day at school, her excitement and the new things that she has noticed so far. She enjoys learning and her teacher, Mrs. P, recognises this and makes sure she gets the necessary support. This includes giving her homework and asking her to speak up in class.


At the end"," There’s even a rainforest inside and we get to go on walks through the rainforest sometimes! The building itself is very bright and airy which is great as all my old teachers used to teach in a very dark room so that means a lot to me! The staff are all lovely too, and they have even brought in yoga classes for the entire school! I’ll miss our small, tight-knit school community but I’m sure we’ll all get to see each other again! 

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale ranges from Level 7 to Level 10, with Level 7 being the best score and Level 10 the worst score. Anna’s story has a score of 6.77, which is close to the 6.8 level, so it’s considered to be within the “readable” range for Grade 2 readers.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale was developed by two readers of text, John F. Flesch and Jennifer A. Kincaid, who wanted to measure how easy or difficult a text is to read, so they could make sense of all the different reading-level conventions that were being used in the English-language classroom at that time. 
The Flesch-Kincaid Scale factors in the number of words, sentences, and syllables in a text, and will give an approximate score in the 7-10 range, where 7 is the best score and 10"," I’m looking forward to some new things here: the gym will be amazing and I’ve heard the swimming pool is even more modern than the old one! But I’ll probably miss the old classes as there are still some things like our art, piano and music classes in the old building! At least the music lessons will have space to set up their instruments. My most anticipated thing is that the old building actually burnt down during the move!

The Skywalk is a glass walkway suspended a few metres above the ground that provides a safe and convenient way to walk across the edge of the Skywalk canopy. When walking across the walkway, the speed limits are very low, ranging from 1 to 3 km/h, which means that one can walk across safely even at a fast speed. Walking on the Skywalk is a bit scary at first. After a while, you get used to it and it is not so bad anymore. The Skywalk has glass that gives the visitor a great view of the ground below. People also use the Skywalk for running, or just for stretching or gym exercises.

" In the city’s souks where you can find everything from rugs to silverware to souvenir sandals there are hundreds of stall owners selling an endless array of goods. The rainwater from the streets is used to water their wares and it is not unusual to see hundreds of shoppers standing under umbrellas in the city’s souks to take advantage of the good weather. But where are they getting their water?  All over the city’s thousands of private roofs are used to capture the rain. As part of the tradition of living in the medina the local people have built their houses on top of the city’s hundreds of small squares. The square is therefore the most obvious place to build a roof which allows rain to be collected and used to water the thousands of roofs which lie beneath. In many ways the city’s water supply has become self-sustainable and part of the new lifestyle of living in the medina.

  In the souks you’ll find shops which sell everything from silverware to souvenir sandals.  But the silverware can’t compete with the real thing. The silverware merchants rely on rainwater to keep their businesses going and they’ve become the city’s self-sustainable businesses

The square is therefore the"," One of the most famous families in this part of the world have always been fond of the M’hamed Hicham El-Hariri and live in one of the famous ‘ribats’ or homes built into the side of a rocky outcrop, these are popular for the incredible views and are rented out to visitors. There is one in the area called Chouhane which is home to the El-Hariri family. The M’hamed Hicham is also very open about the fact that he prefers the rain to stop and the droughts to continue and that his aim is to produce as much of the crop as he can himself. As the owner of one of the largest private vineyards in Morocco he knows the value of a good harvest and has agreed to let a British company run drip tape into his vineyards and into more than 50 other hectares belonging to one of the largest private landowners in Morocco. The British company will help the local population in the oases around Marrakech and the capital of Morocco, Meknes, with installing the new watering systems, has agreed to invest and train thousands of people and is also running drip tape into the homes of the Marrakech elite. The first year the rain does fall the M’hamed Hicham is delighted and runs around the vineyards like a dog with a new bone. Second year it continues to be a problem for him but third and fourth years it continues to"," Because there is water and that there is a need for everyone to use it. Even the poorest can be seen using it to get to work.


The prompt above asks you to consider the local people of Marrakesh, their struggle to access clean drinking water during periods of flooding and how they adapt to change. You could discuss this using the following 2 images and the associated text:

The poor may not be able to afford to pay for bottled water and as such turn to an acceptable source of water - The river.

The local people adapt to the changes in the availability of water and adapt their behaviours in order to access and use this water for personal, domestic and business needs.


The second image from Shutterstock.com, shows the public, private and commercial buildings in Marrakesh all utilising water from the river.

As shown in the above image, people from all walks of life are using and adapting to this new availability of water.


You could write a 3-4 paragraph essay explaining how the local people of Marrakesh adapted to the changes they were faced with and why they needed and adapted in order to access and use water.


Some suggestions could include:  

The local government and government agencies, organisations and individuals that worked to increase access to water.","  As a result of reduced rain there is a growing water scarcity in the city.  Due to this water from the mountains has become more expensive which leads to farmers not growing crops in the city to avoid losing money. And this in turn has reduced the amount of water which is available for the city.  However due to the tourists who visit the city annually there is an increase in the number of vehicles which the city is serviced by.  This has led to an increase in the air pollution which is also a cause for the growing number of respiratory illnesses in the city.  As such the need for affordable and clean drinking water has never been more pressing.


Water is a crucial resource for all living things. However in many regions of the world, access to clean water remains a major challenge due to limited availability of water, poor quality of water, and increased demand for water. This has caused water scarcity in many areas, with consequences ranging from lack of access to clean water for human consumption, animal drinking water, and crop water for agriculture to increased frequency of droughts and floods.

The main source of water for humans is typically groundwater, although many other resources such as sewage, rainwater, surface water, and snow water are also sources of water for humans. The quality of groundwater can vary and in many areas groundwater is heavily polluted. In many locations, surface water sources are contaminated by industrial pollutants and human excrement. While"," The people of Marrakesh depend on rain for their water supplies and it seems that the rains of the last few years have been more frequent than the dry spells. This raises hopes for a future with more rain and more water for the city. But what is causing the droughts and how do the people of Marrakesh manage without a regular water supply?


Here is an extract from the story.

The desert appeared in the city of Marrakesh after the last two years of drought which had led to a state of uncertainty in the local population. The droughts had resulted from a rise in greenhouse gas emissions which had caused a drastic reduction in the amount of rain falling over the region. The droughts had also led to a decrease in the amount of snow and the subsequent melting of the snowpack. This had led to a reduction in the amount of water that reached the city from the Atlas Mountains to the south. This reduction had led to the disappearance of thousands of trees which supplied the city with its water. 

As a result of the drought many of the people of Marrakesh had taken to drilling large boreholes in their gardens in order to provide themselves with an ongoing supply of water. But the wells had already been dug too deep, and in too many places the water had never reached the surface. The people had consequently resorted to carrying water in jerrycans, buckets and bottles. There were many stories in the souks and local"," They enjoy it for its beautiful weather and for the relaxation it brings to the city. As a result, despite the risk of flooding, there are more cars on the road than usual. 
Even though it is illegal to do so, young men and women throw parties on the pavements. They have brought along alcohol and fireworks, which aren’t illegal, but are not entirely welcome. The police and locals try to discourage young people from doing this. They know that the city’s sewage system can’t cope with the waste, and that it attracts rats and other vermin.
This only happens during rainy days though, when the streets become rivers and the city becomes uninhabitable. 
But in spite of all the drawbacks water is essential for the survival of the city, and although it is forbidden to drink it it has to be available to the people. This is achieved by the local government hiring many truckloads of water from other cities at extortionate prices.

  In the month of November the city of Marrakesh Morocco has been experiencing a strange rain phenomenon. It’s been raining cats and dogs and the city’s water pipes are unable to cope with the sudden flooding which turns the streets into rivers. 
The locals have taken to wearing plastic rain-coats to protect themselves from the water poured on the streets.

  It rains about 4 months out of the year in the city of Marrakech. The last two years have seen less rain than normal.

But Kath has decided he needs to do more - he needs to stand on a ladder balancing an egg on top of his head. 'We need to work on your delivery' says Kath. 'I always tell the audience they should call the ambulance'. Alan comes in at this point and tells Kath Gareth believes he is ready. 'Well if he is then I say we let him loose'. So Kath shouts 'LIVE! LIVE!'. And in an instant - Gareth is off the ladder and is spinning and leaping on the stage and the audience ROAR with laughter. Kath smiles. 'Perfect' says Alan. 'Now we just need to get him back on the ladder'. 


Gareth has always wanted to become a clown and he joined his parents and brothers into the circus as soon as he was old enough. He has had to work hard on his skills but his performance at the end of the prompt was excellent. 

Gareth is the youngest son of an engineer and a nursery teacher, his brothers work in banking and computers, and his parents have entered him into a circus. He is the youngest clown in the circus, and he loves every minute of it. But his sister Kath has decided he needs to do more - he needs to stand on a ladder balancing an egg on top of his head. So Kath shouts"," 'We are not sure why. We have just had a clown make an elephant disappear'. 'Oh yes'. says Alan. 'It was quite funny. I hope he doesn't do that again next show'. 

Gareth is really excited about performing with the circus but is worried that people will laugh at him because of his red hair and green trousers.

This story shows the role that a performer plays in the circus. It also shows Gareth's confidence and how he believes people will find what he does funny because of his personal style and physical features.

One day he will be a famous world famous clown. When asked what his greatest fear is Gareth says: 'Being on fire or walking through a crowd and people punching me in the face'.  His family's reaction is the reason for the story.  Kath screams, 'Get them away from me, that boy's a menace'. Alan is concerned but tells his wife: 'I'm not worried Gareth will go straight into the circus, he could be a bit of a menace to himself but he's still our son, he will come back when he's ready'  His reaction is the reason for the story. Kath says: 'Alan I'm worried he will go too far'. He agrees: 'I think you're right Kath, I'll ring the circus people and ask them what he should do.'  That is the reason for the story.  The family are concerned for Gareth's safety. Kath says: 'Get him back home where he belongs, I won't let him join the circus.' Gareth responds: 'I won't Dad, I'm going to be a famous world famous clown. Bye bye'.

Gareth is the youngest son of a family of engineers and a primary school teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers. Kath and Alan have joined the family business, the circus, and have trained Gareth as a clown. Gareth's love of clowning is infectious.

Gareth is especially popular for his jokes, his antics, his pranks. Because Gareth is young and often tries things that adults might consider too daring or 'out there', many in the adult circus are concerned. The other circus members sometimes do not see eye to eye with Alan. But Gareth is a child, and he does what children do. And he is very, very funny. 
When Gareth was 7 he visited a real circus. 'You've found the Circus of the Damned' his mother told him. This was not a good sign. Gareth had always assumed that the circus was in fact a very bad place where only the worst of the bad would perform. So, he was a bit worried about this trip. But his friends were excited, and said that it would be 'amazing'.

I would guess that the sentence length will be close to 40 words, but the sentences can be very long, as it's not easy to determine the number of sentences in the Flesch-Kincaid scale.  Given that it is an adventure story, it may be that there is an overarching story of sorts, but I doubt that you can really determine how many stories there actually are.

The children receive a weekly text from their teacher outlining the menu for the week with pictures of each course on the day. They are then given a set of knives and forks, instructions on how to cook each dish and then they are free to prepare and cook their dish in the kitchen.

On the day of the meal the children arrive at 10am sharp to start their preparations. The parents and teacher are in the kitchen waiting to greet the children and take their coats. Everyone is served a drink and hot tea or coffee before the meal begins at 11am. 

During the meal the children serve and clean up after themselves. The course takes three hours but it feels like much longer as the children spend a lot of their time preparing their dishes. 

Most of the children are quite shy to begin with but become almost hysterical with happiness once the meal is over. Parents describe the experience as wonderful for the children and very educational for the parents. They feel the children learn how to manage difficult situations and prepare delicious meals.

Parents who have taken the course say their children are more self-sufficient and are now capable of cooking for themselves. Parents feel the children have a better understanding of cooking concepts and have developed a wider repertoire of recipes.

The children say they have enjoyed the day. They were surprised at how much they had learnt about cooking and how fun it had been to prepare their dishes. One boy said that he wished he had joined the"," 

Little Chefs runs five one hour long courses in each of the school terms. The course costs £280 for students and parents and free for children who are funded through schools meals. The group of children who do not have a parent who can pay for the course can still have fun and learn how to make good food by taking part in the free school meals clubs. These clubs run at lunchtimes and are supervised by staff trained in nutrition and food hygiene.

Little Chefs courses provide children with the skills to use a range of specialist equipment such as a hot air balloon stove, rice cookers, a convection oven and an electric pressure cooker. Children learn how to plan and cook a meal using the right equipment for the job. They learn the correct way to use knives, chopping boards and pots and pans as well as safely checking and cleaning each piece of equipment before and after use. Children also learn about different types of food, seasoning, tasting and how to take best advantage of seasonal produce.

The course is run by a chef trained in food safety and hygiene who has more than 15 years experience in the food and drink industry. The curriculum is constantly revised to reflect changes in the industry. The school runs the course at their own site, using all the equipment owned and used by the school and all the food is produced by the school kitchen. The school has a very good track record in keeping food hygiene high standards. 

Many parents have said that the course"," There are over 100 chefs working in the City of London who may get inspiration from the work that goes into making food for the children. The children learn how to properly use a knife and how to tell if a food is edible. They watch demonstrations of how to make basic dishes like chicken wings and burgers. 

The story could follow the work of the chef who run the cooking school and their work with children.  The story could start with the Chef saying ""Welcome to our cooking school.  The best thing about the school is we have over 100 chefs from all walks of life coming to our courses.  The school is so popular we have a waiting list of 30 children that are now able to attend the school and cook with us."" The Chef continues ""One of the best things about being a chef is the knowledge you can make a positive difference to the lives of families in need by providing nutritious food for their children.  At the school, we work with local children who have parents who are unemployed or underemployed.  They are either studying at degree level or are too young to go to school.  We organise after school cooking classes for the children who come to our school and really enjoy the course.""  The Chef describes how the children learn proper knife skills and how they also learn about food safety.  They also learn about different food preparation methods and how to cook simple dishes like chicken wings and burgers.  They talk about the positive influence the course has"," Their teenage daughter, Sophie, however, loves to write stories. One Saturday night she gets an idea. She will write a story that is both educational and entertaining so that her friends will want to read it. She goes to her room and starts to write. She starts by saying that she lives in London and that she loves to eat. She then lists to her parents some delicious foods that she enjoys. She then goes on to tell her friends that she has written a story that is very educational and interesting. She shows them the page of her story and asks them to read it. They all say how interesting it is and promise to show the story to other friends. 

Little Chef stories are fun and interesting with a touch of drama to make them engaging for reluctant readers. They are also very effective at building knowledge of key skills like maths, reading and writing. A good story can motivate students to learn new things and be more aware of what they read.

### Little Chef stories can be fun and interesting for reluctant readers


Sophie's story is interesting and is likely to capture the attention of her friends and make them want to read it. In the first line, she tells us that she lives in London and loves to eat. London is a cosmopolitan city with amazing food and restaurants. This is a great way to get the reader interested in her story and establish that the character in the story enjoys the things she describes. In the second line"," The children take their knowledge of serious cooking to a school dinner served for their parents. Most of the students who do the course go on to study further specialised courses, such as, Molecular Gastronomy, which may cost another £800. The children who do not progress to do the course may still enjoy cooking, but usually do not continue it as they are not interested in the same serious approach to cooking that the course offers. The course enables children who do not go on to study further to have a basic knowledge of the art of serious cooking. The children enjoy cooking meat, which they usually prepare themselves.

This story uses the following facts:

* 30 students who want to learn the art of serious cooking
* The course costs £280
* Most of the students who do the course go on to study further specialised courses, such as, Molecular Gastronomy, which may cost £800
* The course enables children who do not go on to study further to have a basic knowledge of the art of serious cooking.

The story is written for people with the Adult level.

  * Lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list for 30 children who want to do the course.
  * Parents pay £280 for the course.
  * The children take their knowledge of serious cooking to a school dinner served for their parents.
  * Most of the students who do the course go on to study further"," But how can the art of cooking be fun and educational, especially for children who may not have any previous culinary skills? Here is what the course leader has to say: ""We use many traditional techniques such as classical techniques of cooking like stirring with a wooden spoon, slicing vegetables with a knife, and making a bed of green peas. But we also make much fun of food safety with very dangerous foods like boiling potatoes and making a fizzy drink using blue food colouring. We make our students learn about ingredients, seasonings, cooking techniques and important food safety issues such as freezing and canning."" Parents are thrilled with the quality and safety of their children's food, and say that they are now able to continue cooking the meals they know and love, using the knowledge and skills that their children have learned. The course teaches children important life skills, making it a worthy investment for parents as well as children.

Honey is a good source of energy and some trace minerals. It has a delicate flavour that resembles that of vanilla.   In modern medicine, it is used to treat diarrhoea and diabetes. Bees make honey for a number of reasons. Firstly it is a form of storage, honey stores well for months without spoiling. Secondly, it helps with their pollination. Bees use the flowers to make sweet nectar, which is when the pollen from the different flowers that the bees have visited comes into contact with each other, which allows bees to find a new food source.   Thirdly, honey can be used to help keep the hive cool in hot weather, and provide food for the larvae.   Finally, honey is used as a tool for marking colonies of bees.

Honey searched for the plant in the supermarket but it was not to be found. Honey then decided to plant this plant at the foot of the stairs where Mary now lived.

Sugar content in honey varies depending on type of flower and climate. Trees produce most types of flowers that are visited by bees. For example, apple trees produce apples that are eaten by bees. The most important factor that limits production of honey is lack of knowledge on how to keep honeybees. Honey is used to sweeten foods, or mixed with water and alcohol to make a syrup. It can be kept for years without losing its flavour. It also contains microbes that break down fats and carbohydrates and keeps the body healthy. Honey has several health benefits. It heals wounds, and boosts the immune system. It also helps regulate glucose levels in the body, which is essential for diabetics. Honey has also been shown to kill viruses and bacteria. Honey is produced by bees all over the world, mainly in Africa and Asia. It's one of the most traded products.

" As I read through the novels I found myself really enjoying many of the stories - some of them have been published before, so presumably the contributors were already famous at the start of the year. But then I came to part two of novels and my jaw literally dropped - it contained a total of 150 original pages of short stories all told in 10 minutes each. Some of them were quite good, especially the last one. Some were okay, but most were pretty poor, and some had spelling and grammar errors, making them downright illegible. Some stories had no title, which is very rude. I think the contributors of this year's collection should be ashamed of themselves. Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain.

Some stories had no title, which is very rude. I think the contributors of this year's collection"," However some of the pieces are so long that it makes it hard to understand where the stories are leading. The authors are very good though and some of the passages are quite beautiful, if you like that type of writing. Overall I think the book is great value for money but there are not enough shorter stories or pieces of original writing to make it a good read for the price. A small price to pay for such quality writing. Overall, I would recommend the book but only if you like reading novels in parts.


This prompt is a little vague. If the writer is to write a short story that tells what people have complained about this year's collection, then a very long story might not be suitable. If the writer is asked to write a short story that is readable by Grade 2 learners, then an easy to understand story with a well developed plot that ends in a satisfying manner would be suitable. The prompt allows the writer flexibility on both counts.


I'll go for the easy option. Some people have complained about this year's collection, New Writing 3, although I cannot understand why.


Candia McWilliam writes: 

This year’s collection has 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99, so amazing it is. But I can’t understand why they’d give us 500 pages of original writing on writing when the book could have just as easily contained 30 short stories, or 1000 pages of original writing on art when there’"," The stories vary in length from short pieces to complete novels, so there is something for everyone. Some stories are quite dark, but overall there is something here for everyone. If you are a beginner to the genre, this could be an excellent place to start. It has sections on character development, conflict, setting and scene design, dialogue, and a good mixture of realistic and fantastic settings. In particular, there is a section on how to develop tension and how to properly introduce foreshadowing into your writing. The format of the stories is also interesting, being divided between chapters and parts. There is a distinct divide between the first two parts, where the former being shorter stories and the latter being novels. The remaining chapters are simply the back half of each individual story, but still make good reads by themselves. The stories cover an impressive range of topics. There is one that is completely about a family who becomes embroiled in a political debate, while another is about a couple who develop a very unusual relationship. There is a story about a man experiencing an out-of-body experience which might be of interest to fans of John Green. Some stories delve into darker topics, such as death, grief and mental health. The writing in this book is solid, without any typos or formatting issues. The only suggestion I would make is that more attention could have been paid to formatting for devices such as the Kindle which will automatically split text for each page so that you can fit more on one"," More importantly there are numerous examples of how to be a better writer. I also found the advice on how to structure your writing to be helpful. In conclusion, yes, this is a disappointing year for new books, but that is to be expected when you consider the cutbacks at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Nevertheless, £6.99 is an excellent value for money for a book of this calibre. The prompt was written by Amanda Knutsen.

We have two distinct types of learning styles - Linguistic and Pedagogical (Teaching/Instructional).

Linguistic learners use words to make sense of information. They process written information more rapidly than other learners.

Pedagogical learners use concepts, connections and relationships to make sense of information. They process written information more slowly than other learners.

It is possible to teach material to both types of learners. The materials can appeal to both their own specialisation, or a combination of both. For example, if you are teaching someone to drive, you could teach them about road signs and the Highway Code. Teaching someone the Highway Code to a Pedagogical Learner could include teaching them about the different types of highways and how they differ to how you would expect a driver to understand the Highway Code. If you are teaching someone the Highway Code to a Linguistic Learner, you could write it in the form of an essay which explores the different types of highways and how they differ"," However, there are also some rather poor pieces which are just rehashes of old ideas, such as The Girl with the Golden Eyes (T. E. Lawrence), or a story about a man who wants to have the perfect sex life until he finds he has nothing but boring sex with the wrong person (Ian McEwan). Some pieces are clearly aimed at a younger audience and feature cartoon characters, such as the Tintin adventure A Christmas for Tintin (Hergé). This shows some imagination and flair, but most children of primary school age would be beyond it. Some stories may be more suitable for older children and adults, such as the story about a man whose love life goes down a storm until he meets his true soulmate (Tania Aelbrecht). Some stories are purely about sex, such as the one about the wife who discovers she is actually turning into a woman whilst having sex (Daisy Johnson). Some stories are very humorous and should be enjoyed by all, such as the one about the dog who has an affair with the woman whose husband looks after him (Robin Hawley). Overall, though, I would be disappointed to receive this year's 'New Writing 3'. It contains so much excellent writing, from the likes of Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain, which does not seem to make its way into the others. There are, however, a number of disappointing pieces too, which detract from the quality of"," There are also some wonderful pieces of work by other authors including an exploration of why we read, the discovery of a long lost tribe, and a young girl's journey into witchcraft. Overall, the book is a great example of a broad spectrum of writing from both established and emerging authors. 

The prompt is to focus on sentence length and complexity in your text. Consider the following text:

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale measures sentence length and sentence complexity. Sentences that are relatively simple and short tend to score high; sentences that are very long and complex, often with a large number of words in a large number of sentences, tend to score lower. Consider the following text: 
Although 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is pretty amazing, Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. There are also some wonderful pieces of work by other authors including an exploration of why we read, the discovery of a long lost tribe, and a young girl's journey into witchcraft. Overall, the book is a great example of a broad spectrum of writing from both established and emerging authors.

Sentence length: 7-9 words. Complex sentences: 4 or more words in a clause or sentence. 
However, the length and complexity of sentences varies considerably throughout the text:
"," Overall, I would say that this was a good addition to the series and will certainly entice a few more customers into the store.

There is also a A2 readable story in the same text, with a similar prompt:  

I recently bought a copy of a new book for the family, called New Writing 3. I have to admit, I was a little reluctant at first, as it was an incredible £6.99. However, I was surprised at the quality of the writing in it - some of the pieces by famous authors such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. I have to admit, this has put my reluctance from not buying the book to a stop. I will certainly be recommending it to friends.


The passage should be assessed as A2, despite the structure of the text (which uses phrases instead of clauses) and the limited number of information points (one author, two pieces of writing). These aspects of the text do"
" When I arrived in the office of Marie Claire, I was very excited and very nervous. So I decided to go for the most basic look I had - a grey pantsuit.
But then I heard the voice at the door. 'Good morning Mrs Currie,' said Marlene Schwarz, the CEO of the company. 'Good morning Marlene, what can I do for you?,' I replied. 'Come in and have a seat.' I followed the woman into the office and I saw she had an eye-catching black hair cut and looked very attractive. 'So Mrs Currie,' began Marlene, 'you will know that I am very interested in the welfare of elephants. 'That's why I've come, you know elephants have been our zoo for many years. And now I want to change that.' 'Change?' 'That's why I'd like to start a campaign to stop buying elephant skins and switch to rhinos.' 'Rhinos?' 'Indeed.' 'But why rhinos?' 'Because I have just been to the Democratic Republic of Congo and witnessed a rhino hunt. I saw how the hunters shot at a rhino in full view of the children. And there were many children watching.' 'Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.' 'But I think we should change to rhinos immediately and cancel our contract with the zoo for the next ten years.' 'What are your reasons for switching to rhinos?' 'It's not just about the"," Finally, I rushed to Marie Claire just in time for the annual report. During the press preview, I had several opportunities to chat with the editor-in-chief of Marie Claire, Eric Vuillard. He is very friendly and I had the opportunity to ask him for advice on what to wear to the annual report. He advised me to wear high heels, an opaque dress and a beautiful necklace and earrings. I went to the annual report with the guidance of Eric Vuillard. This is an annual report that honours the new Marie Claire employees. On the second page is an article about my advice to the editor-in-chief.'

  * Stranger Mandie Currie works at the zoo in Malindi, Kenya. One day, she met the editor-in-chief of Marie Claire, Eric Vuillard, during a press preview. Eric Vuillard was kind enough to give Mandie Currie advice on how to dress for the annual report. She put Eric Vuillard's advice into practise and her appearance helped her gain entry to the annual report.

  * The reader will recognise Eric Vuillard from the magazine Marie Claire, who Mandie Currie spoke to during her day at Marie Claire. Eric Vuillard is a good friend of Mandie Currie's who gave her advice on how to dress for the annual report.

  * Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day at the offices of the magazine Marie Claire. While there,"," After a trip to the loo I was feeling ready for the meeting. My coat was too long so I took it off, then a friend asked me for my autograph. The meeting ended with a cocktail. That was when I first met Marie Claire editor and friend Caroline,' says Mandie. Caroline invited Mandie to the party that followed, where she was received like a star. 'I've already learnt that changing clothes, and especially my coat, is a good idea. So now I know better.' Mandie Currie has been wearing the same clothes since the party. The editor of the magazine Marie Claire has beenfriend her because she was at the party that followed and was willing to ask her to the party. The editor of the magazine Marie Claire has beenfriend her because she is aware of Mandie's good work. Furthermore, she read an interview with Mandie in the magazine where she was mentioned positively. She has therefore decided to ask Mandie to write a guest-blog post on how to dress appropriately for any occasion.

  * Mandie Currie is dressed in a coat she normally wears to work when a friend suggests she should wear a shorter coat for a magazine photoshoot. She is asked for an autograph which she enjoys. She learns that dressing appropriately for an occasion will benefit her in the long-run by wearing the same clothes both for the photoshoot and for the party that followed.

  * Mandie Currie was interviewed by Marie"," 
   Finally I arrived at the magazine offices. The staff was warm and friendly. I quickly went through my usual routine of putting on the Marie Claire uniform and greeting everyone and answering their questions. As I was writing my story, I was reminded of how different this was from any normal day. This was the day of my daughter's engagement, the first day of maternity leave, and the day I had just found out my husband had been unfaithful, and I was still smiling and greeting everyone. 
   And it suddenly struck me how different my life would be if my husband had been faithful. It would be a day like any other but for me. I would not have this special day, my daughter would not be engaged and would never have children. My husband's infidelities were a great source of sadness and heartache for many years. It is a day I will always treasure. Today I was able to wear a different uniform, to go to a different press preview, but most of all I will always treasure the feeling of joy that this day brought to me.'

A story that is readable by Grade 2 learners in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale using the following prompt:

    ""Changing lives with a Stranger"" by Mandie Currie

    ""A zoo-keeper spent the day in the offices of the magazine Marie Claire. 
    'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because"," My hair was a pain, since I use to wear it up, so I decided on a do at the hairdresser for a bit of evening shake. My car was in for an expensive service since I commute by motor bike. That said I still wanted to look my best and go for it. Luckily my friend Claire had sent me an email with the day’s outfit photos and I put them on my phone. My trusty friend suggested an easy top-and-bottoms combination. Claire’s outfit was much more complicated. She had on a black miniskirt and a black body-con dress. So I copied her outfit and changed the skirt to a top and the dress to a body-con top and a black bottom. I didn’t have a belt, but the dress had an elastic belt at the back. Not a bad combination at all!’ The outfit was so successful that the editor gave me the job and now I’m also writing the fashion pages!' 

The prompt would be suitable for a CEFR level D or E learner.


## Story idea
A2 level learner can start by changing the following parts of the text:
- `Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio then to press previews all before lunch. My hair was a pain, since I use to wear it up,"," It would be rude to come to work unshaven. But I was delighted at the jacket, pants and shirt Marie Claire had chosen for me. After the photos I had to drive to the animal park in my uniform and tie a bow round my neck. 'So far so good,' I thought. And after the first day at work I was asked by Marie Claire if I would like to come again the next day in the same clothes. And I said yes, yes I would. The second day Mandie arrived at work in her new clothes and looked beautiful. 'My co-worker asked me if I was going to wear the pants again. 'Of course not, I bought these for my birthday,' I said. The pants were too big and had to be returned. But I also wore my new shirt and jacket for the rest of the days and had a wonderful time. 'Everyone complimented me on my beautiful clothes and I was invited back the next day for a meeting in New York. Mandie, your pants turned out perfectly and Marie Claire was so pleased with my story and photos.'


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade level is a readability scale ranging from 100 (ideal) to 60 (hard to read) based on word lengths (words, sentences, phrases, clauses, and words per sentence). The shorter the text, the higher the grade level it will have on the Flesch-Kincaid scale.


Here is a story"," As I was walking out the door I bumped into a friend of mine, a journalist.' 'Hello, Mandie. Nice to see you again. It looks like we had the same morning dress. Do you mind if I take a look at it?' 'Go right ahead. Here is my day dress.' Mandie smiles and walks away, leaving the journalist speechless. At the end of the day Mandie walks out into the street and notices a man across the street watching her. She turns around and sees it is her good friend Jonas. 'Hi Jonas, how are you doing?' Jonas just shrugs and continues watching Mandie. She walks over to him and asks: 'Jonas, what are you doing here?' Jonas looks up at Mandie with sad eyes and says 'Mandy, you know we haven't talked since I went to prison for murdering your mother.' Mandie is stunned, Jonas has never told her he murdered his mother. She tries to get him to talk more about it, but Jonas just walks away with tears in his eyes. Mandie starts to walk away also. Suddenly a police car pulls up and Jonas runs over to the car. Mandie starts to feel scared and turns around to see what was going on. The police officer tells Jonas to stop running and he starts to explain that he did it, but then realizes he doesn't have anything to admit to. Mandie takes his hand and tells"
" The pieces have been passed down through the Lagasse family for generations. The brothers now take turns selecting a piece and taking a swing at the board. Their father was a builder and brought this board to the US from France in the 40's. The board is called a pogo stick. As they grow up the brothers would take turns to pogo on the pogo stick. The board is made of hard plastic with the slots the size of a person's hand. The brothers hit the pogo stick and it bounces up to a height of 6 feet. They love this game and now they are now running their own pogo stick company. 
  
Norm: We are the Lagasse Brothers. We run a pogo stick company. 

Dave: We Lagasse Brothers are also running a pogo stick company. 

Norm: When we were kids we would take turns pogoing on the pogo stick. 

Dave: It's so great to see you again Norm. How have you been? 

Norm: Great. I've been living in Santa Fe but am now back in San Francisco where I grew up. How have you been? 

Dave: Great. I'm living here in the US. How's business? 

Norm: Great. It's booming. We're now the number one pogo stick company in the US. 

Dave: That's great. We love this game too. 

Norm: Our game"," One piece fits perfectly into the shape of a horseshoe. The other piece is for the two of them to argue over. They are now a millionaire and are now diversified enough to enjoy a game of Monopoly. As they go around the house collecting the money they're left with an envelope with $15 in it. They sit back down at the board and put the $15 on a horseshoe with the word ""LAGARRE"" written on it in cursive. ""We'll do the city"", says Norm. They roll the dice and move their token to the city. They move their token to downtown and their eyes light up. Norm says ""we should put an airport on the board. We could be Airports of America"". Dave looks over at him and says ""are you insane? We can't afford an airport. We're millionaires and airports are for poor people"". Norm starts yelling ""what if I told you you could make money off of an airport? Then we'd both be rich"". Norm's voice gets higher with each passing sentence. He continues to yell ""just sign over the airport to me. You'll never use it. There is no airport. An airport doesn't exist!"" Dave looks at him, the $15 and the horseshoe and says ""ok Norm, you're the business-genius"". Dave says ""you have a deal. We'll shake on it and we'll call it a partnership"". Norm says ""you mean to"," They started playing the game when they were young and now it is their career. Norm always wins the game and Dave often ends up with the dirty pieces. One day Dave is thinking to himself and says ""I have an idea, I am going to write a business book and let me tell you Norm how I am going to do it"". Norm just nods in agreement and starts telling Dave how he is going to do it. One day Dave is lying on the sofa thinking about his book when he notices that Norm has a curious look on his face. He then calls Norm over to the table where the game is and asks him what is wrong. Norm tells Dave that he has suddenly realized that he has never written a business book and asks Dave if Dave would be willing to write the book for him. Dave is very happy as this is exactly what he has been thinking about himself and he has written his own business plan.  Dave then starts telling Norm about his plan and Norm begins to think ""Well, it is quite similar to the plan I wrote myself but I cannot remember where I wrote it"". Norm then suggests that they go into the kitchen and see if they can find the original plan on the kitchen counter. The two brothers go into the kitchen and look at the kitchen counter and there on the counter is the plan that Dave had prepared. Norm then takes the plan and begins to read it. The two brothers are shocked at what they find written on the page and Dave says ""That is not"," They had played this game as kids, with Norm's mother helping the boys with the rules and scoring. To play they would take turns rolling a dice, and matching a matching pair of dice and move one of the dice to whatever space on the board matched the number on the dice. If neither number matched on either dice then a 'on to a winner' phrase would be uttered. There were also 'off to a loser' phrases. The game was a source of great joy in the family. Dave, the older brother and Norm the younger continued with the childhood game today. Dave says 'Norm this was my brother's childhood game. We used to play it as kids. We will continue to play it'. Norm says 'Dave this was my brother's childhood game. We used to play it as kids. We will continue to play it'. Both are now looking at the board and on one particular space on the board they see a six and a seven, but there is nothing on either side of the spaces. Neither says anything. Dave looks up at his brother and says 'What do you think this means?' Norm looks down at the board and says 'I think this means you are going to lose, you roll a six and a seven, but there is nothing on either side of the spaces, so it's a tie'. Dave smiles, looks down and says 'This means you are on a winner'. Norm looks confused and says 'What do you mean? You rolled a six and"," Across the top are the words ‘Life is a game’ and the two brothers have painted the floor in the shapes of a circle and a square. When they were kids they played an absurd game called ‘Life is a game of chess’ and they have taken the idea and run with it. They are turning their home into a casino. ‘Life is a game of chess’ involved one player sitting down on an undressed lawn chair and other player playing an absurd game of chess with a plastic version of the chair sitting in a circle of wooden pieces around the ‘chess’ chair. In the square the other player had to throw dice to try and win. To add to the fun one of the players had to pull out cans of tuna for their imaginary fish, that made a noise when it hit the water. Their parents thought it was odd but went along with the game until it got to Dave who was the only one sitting down. Dave’s parents are not happy at all and are now calling the police. Dave tries to explain that it is just a game but his parents have not played it and they do not realise just how odd it is. 

Dave and Norm are running a casino out of their house in their childhood game ‘Life is a Game of Chess’. They are taking inspiration from their favourite childhood game, but they are doing it without the parent’s permission. They are charging money for the game and their customers are betting on who will win the game"," Each piece represents a square mile of property that their company has acquired. Dave and Norm Lagasse have found that their childhood game of acquiring properties and selling them again is now a major source of revenue for their business. 

The story presents as a linear narrative with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  The story conveys information succinctly with a simple sentence structure. However, the language is complex and contains polysyllabic words, complex phrases and the use of figurative language. Dave and Norm Lagasse have found their childhood game is a source of revenue for their business, which they now consider as a major source of their income. 

The brothers are reliving their childhood game as adults, and they are selling properties on their childhood board game.

"," The brothers have been involved in the board game business for many years now but this was their first foray into the competitive market. It is clear that Dave and Norm Lagasse are very proud of their well-known and long-standing board game, Monopoly, which they founded.  

Dave, a small-sized and wiry-looking brother, offers his two index fingers and offers to describe the rules of the board game they are playing. He explains that they begin with 3 tokens, and that the board consists of a large triangle with four smaller triangles that make up the large triangle on each corner.  

While Dave is describing the game to Norm, Norm is moving a token from one space on the board to the other. Norm has large hands and he uses his index fingers and thumb to move the small tokens.  

""It’s a strategic game.  You’ve got to be careful not to leave any of your property exposed. You’ve got to pay attention to what buildings are adjacent to what properties to avoid any conflicts,” Norm concludes. 

Dave continues: “This is true, but in our game there are no conflicts. Every property in our game is adjacent to exactly two other properties. If you want to be successful you should pay attention to your adjacent properties.”   

After further discussion, the brothers come to an agreement and the game continues.

" He sat for a while and then sighed. It had been a long week and an even longer day. He needed a drink.

He stood up, walked across the office and reached for the door, when he noticed something that had been nagging at him for some time. The door handle was ajar. He took two steps forward, hesitated, and then pushed the door open with a gentle push. The door closed behind him softly, and he was in the hallway. A shaft of moonlight pierced the darkness of the stairwell, and he could see the outline of the door to his left, which led to the stairwell that served the floors above and below. He stepped over the threshold, and the door closed behind him quietly.

He had no idea where he was or how he had gotten there. He just knew that he needed a drink, and he needed it now. Dragging his feet, he climbed the stairs slowly. They creaked under his feet, and he could hear the old house settling for the night. He reached the landing halfway up, leaned against the wall and surveyed the room. The flickering candlelight reflected on the old walls, and he had a feeling that he was in some kind of a crypt. The stairs led to the second floor, and he began to think he had made a mistake. He could just head back downstairs and go to sleep, but his stomach felt queasy, and he had another drink on him. No"," ""Yes. It's not far now.  I hope. I don't want to travel at night. I'll have to keep an eye out for guards. That'll be easy. I've been expecting that all day. But what I had not expected is that it would take us so long to get there. We're going too slowly. We'll have to make up the time at the next town. And what's the point of going there?  I don't know anyone there. And they might know of a way to the village. If they don't have guards we can overpower them. We can kill them if we have to, but we don't want to have to. We're here now.  They're going to send us to the village. That's the plan. If we can just keep our eyes open we might get there.""

The ships' lights seemed very far away. They had been a source of great interest in the first place when he left England on the ship and he was looking forward to seeing them again. As the carriage drew up in front of the hotel he heard a loud cheer and looked out of the window to see a vast crowd gathered on the beach.  
The cheers came from the men who were there to greet the returning ships and to carry Sir Francis Cromarty off on a barge to his house.

Dr Kemp watched the scene for a moment, then leaned back in his seat and smiled.  This was certainly going to be a memorable return journey.

The NASA-Aberta team collaborated with experts at the University of Waterloo and the Université de Montréal to validate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level metric on a sample of NASA textual data. NASA-Aberta found that a grade 3 reader can comprehend the text provided in the sample and a grade 2 reader can comprehend a majority of the text if the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level metric is used as a guide. A NASA-Aberta team member who has expertise in text complexity analysis commented on the paper: ""The results are quite interesting and are likely due to the large vocabulary size and the narrative nature of the text. The results from the sample of NASA textual data are quite encouraging and suggest that NASA textual data could be utilized in automatic text comprehension systems.""

" Tourists and school groups have been flocking to the pictures for tours, with no extra protection or care, as the pictures are protected by law and the local mountain guides, but this has led to many accidents in the past. A recent tourist hit a rock wall that caused an avalanche that killed ten people and injured dozens. The tourists were unaware that the pictures were there and had just started to walk along a route that led them towards the wall. Another tourist got stuck after falling down a ravine and couldn't get back up so her guide brought her close to the wall where the drawings were so she could get a picture. This guide had not studied the protection of the pictures and was just trying to help the tourist, but the tourist stepped on a picture and died. The tourists now have to pay for the tourist and guide's accident insurance. The insurance doesn't cover the damage caused by the tourists, and many tourists don't believe the pictures are even there. Because of this, tourists are often unaware of the protection that exists and try to stand closer to the pictures without the proper gear to protect against avalanches or falling rocks. Avalanches have destroyed one of the most well-known pictures, ""The Eagle and Child"". A tourist, who worked in construction, was using a portable toilet close to the wall. When he stood to urinate, he started an avalanche that destroyed 50 feet of rock art. Tourists are now encouraged to hike on the pictures in the same","

Use the following story as a starting point:

Scientists have discovered a hidden trove of ancient rock art in the French Alps that is rapidly being destroyed. Tens of thousands of drawings are hidden in the rocks and have been carved there for hundreds of years. The drawings depict human images, animals and even dragons.

The discovery of the art brought great excitement to the area. However, now researchers fear that the drawings will soon be destroyed and lost to future generations.

The discovery of the hidden artwork has sparked a bitter political dispute between France and Italy over the ownership of the land. France claims the art belongs to the country, but Italy argues that the Italian government has inherited title to the land and that it is responsible for protecting the art.

The Italian government has refused to allow French experts access to the site and has even delayed the process of eradicating the ancient drawings. The dispute has done immense damage to the international reputation of the site and the artwork and is endangering the survival of the art for future generations.

It is believed that the art could date back as far as 4,000 years. The drawings show many images of humans, animals and even dragons. Some of the images appear to depict battles between different armies. The artwork is of exceptional quality and is extremely well preserved.

The scientists responsible for the discovery have already started carrying out a programme of urgent research to determine how the artwork could be protected.
","  This is an example of careless tourists damaging cultural heritage which is France's responsibility to protect.

There are two ways that careless tourists can destroy cultural heritage:

1. They can break it by accident.
2. They can destroy it will intentional.

The tourists in this case did neither. They didn't break the pictures, and they didn't intend to destroy them. They just need to be more careful and not to walk on the ancient pictures.

The careless tourists can also destroy cultural heritage intentionally, like they did to the ancient rock carvings in Mont Bego. The tourists broke 36000 ancient pictures, but this is not the first time this has happened. The French culture has been trying to cover it up for a long time, but it didn't work. Tourists do not respect the French culture and heritage. It's time that the French culture protects its heritage and reports this to the tourists.

The story should include the following: 

A brief background to the situation
An overview of the scientists' warnings and recommendations to prevent further damage
A detailed description of the tourist group's experience and the steps they took to understand the situation
An exploration of why the situation has come to be a crisis
The scientists' recommendations for protecting the art and further damage is prevented.
A call for action from the researchers and scientists
The impact of the crisis on the tourists, tourists organizations, and the local community.

The following are some possible responses to the prompt: 

We were tourists visiting Mont-Bego. We're so sorry to hear that so many ancient pictures have been damaged. 
We hope you have great fun while you're in the area! Our tour guides would have been happy to point out any ancient pictures that may have been damaged. We'll make sure to tell our friends about this experience as soon as we get home. 

We'd love to see the local authorities take strong measures to protect the ancient pictures and prevent further damage. We hope you can give us more information. 

Thank you for your time and attention! 

Responses should make specific recommendations for reducing the severity of the problem and ensuring the art's survival for future generations. These may include steps that the tourists, researchers and organizations can take to prevent further damage, as well as stronger enforcement and penalties for anyone breaking the laws to preserve the art.

In today’s world there are advertisements all around us. Whether it’s television, radio or the internet; you’re likely to encounter an advertisement at some point. With the plethora of advertisements we are constantly bombarded with, many of them feature small children and even when they don’t, many advertisers still attempt to attract children into their product. Take the case of Coke and their famous cartoon mascot, it’s hard not to see the similarities between the two and is likely why I see children everywhere I go. From an early age we are encouraged to associate new things with good things in our lives and by focusing on the similarities between the Coke and the animal it represents we are essentially being trained to see things this way and subsequently associate it with the good thing.

Also there’s a lot of sugary foods and drinks in these ads which is not good for kids who are not supposed to eat that.

This is a fun read for kids to enjoy. They will learn that children’s desires can influence what advertisers do. They will also learn the origins of many of the popular advertising campaigns like “Babysitter Wanted.” You can share these “Babysitter Wanted” stories with your friends so they too can enjoy them.

Write a paragraph that summarises how TV ads are written for kids.

The language in TV ads for kids is very creative. Adverts show cartoon animals playing or running around or diving into a pool, or animals with fruits or vegetables for snacks. The children will recognise and like these images because they are shown in an environment that is safe and familiar to them, like TV or a video game. The images also contain adult wordings like ""dive into a pool"". But in the same ad or in the accompanying music or song, adult words are switched with child words, like for example ""run and fall down"", ""play with the water bottle"" are switched with ""this water bottle is nice"". 

Another form of creative language is the use of idioms, like ""play with the water bottle"" is understood as ""have fun with the water bottle"". Also the use of slang or juvenile expressions is popular. For example ""have a laugh"", ""blow out the candles"", ""stay up late"" are all words that are commonly used by children but that are considered very adult by grown ups. 

The combination of creative images, new words, slang and juvenile expressions is very effective in communicating with children, making them feel close to the ad and wanting to try or play with the product shown.

  
All advertisements used to make my shopping decision were targeted at children. For"," The story 'Dog' shows how television has influenced children's behaviour.

We see adverts on TV all the time but we do not understand what it is we are being sold. A recent study has shown that children between the age of 2 and 5 now spend an average of 6 hours a day on screen media and that they have become much more influenced by advertisements than their parents. The book 'Dog' looks at how television has influenced children's behaviour and shows how people react to TV commercials.

It seems that our behaviour has been influenced by the TV programmes we watch. Adults tend to look at children and see pets. As a result when we see a television commercial we are influenced by the character in the advert and how it is dressed. The story 'Dog' looks at how television has influenced children's behaviour.

This book shows how the television has influenced children's behaviour and will be a good read for readers of all ages.

Use examples to support your point.

Incorporating animals into your advertising is not only effective, it is down to your creative thinking. It does not have to be only about animals in advertisements. You can do it in a fun and engaging way by incorporating animals in the following manner:  

Examples: 
- TV ads featuring cartoon animals such as rabbits, fish or mice.
- Animations featuring animals such as dogs running or kittens playing.
- Using animals in artworks such as paintings, photography or sculptures.

Advertising that is effective and engaging for people of different ages.

While many advertisers have targeted TV, radio and print ads towards an adult audience, there is another approach that is much more effective - to target ads to people of different ages. This is because the majority of people interact with media (e.g. TV, radio, internet) of different types at different ages. While many advertising messages are generic and therefore ineffective (and even harmful), the audience can be divided into different groups of consumers with different interests. For example, middle aged people may be more interested in lifestyle and luxury brands whereas children","

" You'd approach them and say: ""I see that you are leaving this place. Would you be interested in letting me know about any open flats that are available? I have a friend who is moving into a similar area and we would like to check that out too.""... After the initial contact we received about 4 offers each week for the next three weeks and a flat was secured for the month of September. 

The flat we ended up moving into was a 3rd floor apartment, in the suburbs, which we loved. The price was about 140% of our average yearly salary, it had a huge bedroom, very large bathroom, an extra bathroom and a garage. We moved in, and after just a couple of weeks my wife and I had found our feet, we were comfortable living there and had plenty of friends who also had moved into the building. 

A great flat is worth its weight in gold, the same goes for real estate agents and property managers.


#  # Property Management in Dublin

What is Property Management?
Property management companies (PMC) manage properties for others, typically by renting out or subdividing existing spaces and collecting rent. This often includes weekly or daily cleaning and other amenities. PMCs are typically the third party involved in a lease, after the owner and the tenant. As such, they must be held to a higher standard of quality than the owner or tenant, and so may be more costly than other options. 
"," At that time Dublin was a small city, and there were not that many rentals. We decided to walk from the city center, which was fairly easy since it was a warm day and the walk from town was also a leisurely stroll. As we approached the outskirts the houses became more expensive and more irregularly proportioned, with larger lawns, more trees, and often perched higher than the road. We were going from a rent of less than $80,000 a year to over $1,000,000. We saw one place that seemed appealing - the owner was away for work and his wife was there alone. We rang the doorbell and she buzzed us in. We walked in and the first thing we noticed was how big the house was and how bright and airy it was. Then we saw the beds - and the curtains and furniture. It was like stepping back in time to the 19th century. We could see that the owner was going to be back soon, and there was nothing more to do but unpack and enjoy our weekend. The following week the owner called and asked for our first rental payment of $30,000, more than we had hoped for but still a steal. And, to this day, that is the way we have maintained our family of four in our very own ""gold-diggers"" home - at a price we could afford.


Have a look at our story and make sure you give it a try!

"," I got in touch with a friend of mine who had a house in Donabate and was keen to rent out his place to me and my partner. We have been really happy with the house and the location. It's a nice distance from the city center but is easy to get around by foot. We are now thinking of selling the place and relocating. 

This could be a story about a flat hunter in Dublin or a flat renter in Dublin. Either way it should be about a couple who try to find the perfect flat at the perfect price and how they luck into it.

A good starting point would be to find a couple that was trying to find their perfect flat in Dublin. You could write in the present tense and use the words ‘I’ and ‘we’ to write ‘we’re trying to find our perfect flat in Dublin’.

Then you can start your story by setting the scene. Begin by telling the reader what the city of Dublin looks like and the weather like in the beginning of March. ‘It was a cold, drizzly March. Everything was covered in snow’. Keep developing the setting by giving more details. ‘Dublin was full of bustling, foot traffic. Pedestrians dodging taxis on Grafton Street. Shoppers on the eastlink center mall. A heavy traffic light was waiting for me at Sackville Street.’ This setting will help you to show us the chaos that is Dublin"," 

A flat in Dublin at a price you could afford is like finding gold in the gold rush.

  1. First you needed to know someone who knew someone who had a place to go. 
  2. That person knew someone who had a friend who was looking to lease a place. 
  3. Then the three of you arranged to meet in a public place, often a pub.

  4. After an appropriate amount of time you were approached by the landlord of the pub who was happy to lease your party the flat at the desired price.

  5. If there is anything you can leave behind when leasing a place it is your own personal belongings. One of your items was a bag containing a variety of useful items. 
  6. The landlord had recommended to his friend that you were the best person to lease their space as you were extremely personable, honest, and hardworking.

  7. The friend of the landlord was ready to lease the space to your group at the price that your group was happy with.

  8. The lease was signed and the keys were transferred to your group. The three of you celebrated your good fortune.

  9. The lease for the space is for one year. During the year you must clean the place to the level that the landlord requires. The landlord will check in with you every six months regarding the cleanliness of the place.

  10. If you want to stay past the"," So, on my walk to college, I asked all the students I knew if they knew of any available apartments. When I got to the college, I asked in the coffee shop. One girl I met there told me about an apartment she knew of that was being vacated. I asked if I could stop by for a look. We went, and the apartment was in great shape and on the market for about half of what I knew I could afford. The only catch was it was in Ballsbridge, a few blocks from the college. That would be fine. It was in a great location, and we jumped at the chance. So my friend and I went to look at the place, and we fell in love with the apartment. It didn't hurt that the apartment was near a Metro station, a short walk from the city centre. So, that weekend, we loaded up the car and drove south to Dublin. And with us was my friend's brother. He lives in Florida, and we were going to surprise him with a visit from the south. He didn't know where we were going until we arrived there. And that, of course, was the best part. We knew we had to move quickly because we didn't want to miss the chance of a lifetime, so we quickly got some things together and headed for a bus that would take us to Ballsbridge. It was there that we found the perfect apartment, and we signed the papers within the hour. We could"," Finding this apartment was like discovering a treasure: it was spacious and the location was ideal. Everything was within your reach, from the kitchen appliances to a bathroom with a shower. Having all this at once was a huge weight off your shoulders.

The website gave basic information about the property, price, and contact details.  The contact details were for a contact in the property sales department. Calling the number in the website I got through and spoke to a real estate agent.  I explained that I wanted to buy a property in Dublin and needed to know a price. She put me in touch with a real estate colleague who could offer me an indicative price. We continued our conversation via email, and he gave me a price and terms.  After some negotiation, I had finalised the purchase price and my contract was being drawn up. When the contract was ready, I submitted it to the real estate agent. She went through my contract with the solicitor, and when they were happy with the contract, she emailed it to me.  The next morning I travelled to Dublin and met the real estate colleague to sign the contract at his office.  When we arrived at the office, the real estate colleague was surprised to see me as he was expecting a different person. He explained that he had got the email with the contract but assumed the person he was meeting was not going to show.  He asked if everything was okay and after I confirmed it was, he offered to call the person with the contract to explain why I was there.  I returned to Dublin a few days later for my inspection of the property with the real estate colleague.  The inspection"
" All of this will influence how you perceive us. Second impressions are even more important. Research has shown that people form opinions of us within the first fifteen minutes of meeting. This is why it is essential to make a good first impression. Be prepared to have a conversation. If you need to check your watch make the time you say or do so while you are looking at your watch. This shows you are more worried about your time than making a good impression. Avoid interrupting. Be prepared to be the one who is in control of the flow of the conversation. Ask questions. Ask open ended questions that can lead to a conversation. For example, if someone is talking ask a question to get them to talk about something else. Ask questions about the weather, current events, famous people you know or ask them about a particular hobby they have. You never know where the conversation might go. Third impressions are even more important. Research has shown that people form opinions of us within the first thirty days of meeting. Therefore it is important to have a great first impression but it is even more important to maintain a good conversation.

Ask questions, be honest and express your thoughts clearly. Show respect. Research has shown that people show respect for people who show respect for them. Respect is more than just saying “excuse me” or showing"," It is important when we are interviewing to show interest in the position you are applying for and to display the enthusiasm and knowledge to show that you are a good fit for the position. During the interview you should make clear eye contact show enthusiasm in your posture and body movements. You should also be on time and prepared. Finally remember to show your personality in your words and mannerisms while you answer the questions. Interviewees are often there to make a judgement and they can base their decision on how you respond to their questions. If you do not know the answer you should offer to contact the appropriate person for the company in case you need to get the information from them. If you are asked a difficult question or you get negative feedback make sure to acknowledge the person who gave you the feedback and try to find out how you can improve going forward.

"," It’s important to pay close attention to these details because how we present ourselves can say a lot about who we are. When meeting a new person, make a point to be friendly, make eye contact, speak clearly and slow down so that person has a chance to fully listen to you. It’s also good to share small talk to keep the conversation going. Don’t be afraid to show interest in that person, ask questions about their job, hobbies and their family. If you make a point to show interest in that person then you will likely start a friendly conversation and it will also help you build a relationship with that person.

Person [name], a [job/business name], is very friendly and makes a good first impression.
[Person name] is very friendly and makes a good first impression. [Person's job/business name] is very friendly and makes a good first impression. 

Interviewing is an art. As an interviewer I have to decide whether this candidate is suitable for the role I am looking for. During the interview I want to gather as much information about the candidate as possible. To help me gather this information I will try to answer the following questions using the information provided. At the end of the interview, I will also take into account the candidate's background.


Interview Questions
* What is your name?* What is your job?* Can you please introduce"," Be mindful of how you dress, how you speak and how you move your body to show confidence. Dressing down can make someone think you are less important or important which can make them less likely to be approachable. Always dress for the weather. Always bring a bag or pocketbook to cover your lap bag and your briefcase. They should fit in a pocket. Tie your shoes and never wear heels. You want to show people you are a team player. So don't slouch! You want to show people you are engaged. Don't be standoffish and don't be rude. People will judge you by how you treat others and this is true for everyone. Treating people with respect will lead them to treat you with respect. People say things sometimes without meaning to actually mean it. Be mindful of your body language. Give a person space and don't assume they want to be closer. Take initiative and ask for help. Show people you are a good listener. People may not speak right away but they do understand they can approach you for help. So be a good listener. And be a good manager. People will respect you for showing them how you lead by example. So take the lead. Learn from others. Watch good managers, leaders and employees. Observe them and learn from their communication styles. There's a science to communication and it is learned. People talk and listen in different ways. Listen intently, really hear what is said and say ""yes"" to"," All of these things together give the person an initial impression of who we are.  When giving an interview ask the person you are interviewing if you can ask them a couple of questions before you start your interview. Ask them about their previous experience with interview questions. See if you can observe whether they are looking you in the eyes, are they leaning back or forward in their chair etc. These things will give you a good indication of how they perceive the situation. Once you have a few minutes to prepare, you can try and answer the questions you have prepared as effectively as you can. Make sure to take note of their initial impressions of you and try and match your responses to theirs. It will pay of in the long run.  As an employer you will be taking a risk hiring a person for a position. There are certain qualities that will help you determine whether the risk is worth taking. This includes first impression of how the person will perform during the interview process as well as during the working life of the person. Make sure to ask the person you are interviewing about their previous experiences and try and observe the initial impressions of the person from your questions. 

A2 Learner:
The person you are interviewing is very observant and seems to have great first impression.  She also speaks quickly and uses intense body language.  Based on what she was wearing and how she was sitting it seems like she is more relaxed and likely to be more engaged with the interview process and may be less"," Therefore we need to take our time when preparing for an interview to make sure that we give a good impression to the person that we are with.

What had happened? Where had she gone? 

There was much confusion on the stage and in the audience. Raoul had cried out. Count Philippe had jumped up in his box. People looked at them and wondered if this event was connected in any way with the paragraph in the morning's paper.

 

The Countess Of Rosseau was found dead in her study, a silver dagger by her side, the tip blunted. The police were quick to suspect murder, for the Countess was wealthy and well loved; and this one noted in her journals several hints that she was considering emigration.

 

The investigation was quick to unearth evidence, leading the police to believe that she had died at her desk, perhaps after succumbing to her fear of needles. When the door to her study was opened, the police found the body, partially disassembled in a drawer, in which she had been attempting to conceal it.

 

The police arrested Raoul, who was the Countess' lover, but who was also a serial killer who had been convicted of his previous crimes, and who had served time in prison.

 

When questioned, he claimed that he was looking for a replacement needle to prick his finger after the Countess' death; and that while looking for it, he had forgotten that he no longer had the original. The police did a quick search of the Countess' study and did not find the needle, but did","

Then an assistant came running up to the stage, holding something in her hand. It was the little paper airplane that Marguerite had given her for her birthday. She had forgotten all about it in the excitement of the moment.

Marguerite had seen it in her hand and then the confusion had been complete. She had felt herself begin to cry, and the audience, who had been watching her with growing interest, had followed her lead. She had stepped down from the stage and returned the airplane to its owner. 

Later, she found out that her father, who had been in the audience, had recognized the airplane and had sent a car for her as soon as it was over. Afterward, when they had gone up to the stage again for the speech, her parents had been waiting for her. 

Her father had embraced her and thanked the audience for their warm reception. She had felt both happy and confused to realize that she had been able to make a difference in the world.

" They're beautiful, they're smart, and they're social and they're fun. In fact they are so fun that people go to great lengths to keep them. If they get upset they can be difficult to look after. But just as dolphins can be highly social, sometimes they're not so keen. In shallow water, for instance, a group may swim past a human. Suddenly they break into a gallop. The dolphin might have been content to follow the human's lead for a few moments, but not today. Today the dolphin feels left out and it shows. The Human caught on film, or a family group of them, are racing past a group of bottlenose dolphins swimming near Moreton Island. The humans do a little skip, wave and giggle. The dolphins, however, just keep swimming. So the dolphins don't like humans much. No wonder they're in trouble. 

The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society are concerned that the dolphin population is in steep decline and the Government isn't doing enough to help. Despite enjoying certain privileges, including the ability to swim inshore, the species is regarded as critically endangered. The Government has agreed to set aside £20 million for dolphin-related marine research and protection, but that's only a drop in the ocean compared to the need. In particular, the organisation is concerned about the impact of commercial whaling. Although this has been discontinued, it has had a devastating effect"," When a dolphin emerges from the water you want to know it, want to find out what they are doing and want to watch their expressions. When dolphins smile we feel close to them. The dolphin in the picture, with its big teeth, looks ferocious and mean. Yet it is a gentle dolphin that smiles. It is the face of the sea. It may look a bit scary, but in its smile it is one of the friendliest creatures on the planet. 

Dolphins are intelligent, social mammals. They are highly social, living in family groups called pods. They use a variety of sounds to communicate, and can even make art out of noises made with their blow hole. They have very large brains and are known to use tools. They can also make facial expressions that convey a great deal of information.

Dolphins live in the sea all over the world. In the UK alone there are around 30 species. Around 5,000 dolphins are killed bycatch every year. The species DDHCS says are most at risk are the Southern Resident Killer Whale, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin, the Risso's Dolphin, the Blue Whale Shark and the Atlantic White Shark. 

Dolphins' teeth are used for defence and to grab and drag prey. Yet they also have some very unique features. The two top front teeth are used for nipping and chewing. They can also be"," We anthropomorphise them, treat them as though they are sentient. We see them as ourselves, we consider what it would be like to be a dolphin, and we hope they'll one day be reborn as a member of the marine mammal club. In the wild dolphins enjoy warm saltwater, they eat krill, shrimp, and other fish. They have families and form bonds with other dolphins.  They are social and can perform group behaviours, such as synchronised breaching. They can even play by dashing through waves at speeds of up to 35 km/h, giving humans a close view of their sleek bodies and webbed feet. We know from scientific studies that dolphins can feel emotion, empathy, and even love. According to psychologists, dolphins are highly intelligent, with social and cognitive skills, even comparable to humans. We see them as cute, and we assume that they feel just like us.  If we are to believe the film Blue Planet II and the book Our Final Hour, it seems that dolphins are not as we imagine them. When they feel they are not valued, they risk themselves to save their families, yet it is their families who, because of human hunting, and the loss of their habitats, are at risk of extinction. As humans, we need to take care of them. We should give dolphins more space to breed and spend time together, instead of keeping them in small quarters. We should reduce the human"," We know their names, and we know their cries and even their bad moods are easily ignored. Yet the dolphin's plight may remind us that no animal deserves to be ignored. It's not their fault. Humans are to blame.  

This story is from Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society’s blog: The Dolphin Doctors.   

The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society’s blog offers a compelling read in which Mark Simmonds recounts the history of the dolphin and its peril in modern times, and presents the case for protecting the dolphins of the sea.

Behind the Dolphin's Smile: People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate.  

Mark Simmonds, a doctor who cares for sick and injured dolphins, recounts the history of the dolphin and its peril in modern times, and presents the case for protecting the dolphins of the sea. He then goes on to describe some innovative projects in which dolphins and their humans work together. In short,"," They are beautiful animals who give so much of themselves in service to us. Many people think of dolphins as being'smiley' as a result.  Dolphins are not actually'smiling'. They do however have the ability to raise and lower their mouth, something that was thought to be an indication of social communication. What seems to happen is that when the dolphins are frightened their mouths close. In reality we really do not know how they communicate and we probably do not fully understand the full implications of this natural ability. Dolphins have a right to live their lives free of abuse. They are no longer taken in captivity. They are fed a more balanced diet and given more space. They are not slaughtered for their meat. Yet, despite all of this, they are still being driven to unspeakable slaughter.  When people swim with dolphins it is entirely appropriate. They are beautiful animals, intelligent and, although they have different personalities, when they want to they can be quite gentle. In some cases the dolphins may be born at sea and subsequently become tame. They can recognise their owners. They can also be very mischievous and try to pull your arms off if you get too close to them. But in other circumstances when they feel threatened, they can be very aggressive. In a few cases the dolphins can be quite 'baby like', i.e. they may not have learned to be aggressive but may instead have been starved and","

"," Perhaps it is because they are so human like, with their big, brown eyes and soft fur. Or maybe it's because we just like to look at them, as we do so many other beautiful things. We see them on TV, they swim next to us on a summer evening. We know that dolphins sleep underwater, under the sea. And they don't just swim under the surface, they also come to the surface to play and frolic. The dolphin is an icon of pure joy and wonder for many of us. We have always looked up to these gentle animals and been inspired by them in our daily lives. But in recent years a wave of attacks and harassment of dolphins in the Sea of Japan and south of Europe have forced them to take steps for their own safety. Some dolphins are being shot dead at sea and others are being put to sleep. There is an urgent need for an effective global ban on commercial whaling, yet in 2018 we saw the resumption of the world's only legitimate commercial whaling. In Sea of Japan and other regions the dolphins are under threat and it's our duty as humans to help them. Dolphins are beautiful creatures, and although we know so much about them, they still remain just like any other living being, and it would be a shame to lose them from the world just because we no longer understand so much about them. It wouldn't be the same without them. It's now our turn to look after them"
" This is bad for two reasons. The first is that we lose a sense of connection with others. We might see a video and want to share it with our friends but instead of having a face-to-face conversation we're watching it on our phones instead. The second reason we lose connection with one another is that our culture is becoming increasingly distracted and our lives are getting more screen time than face-to-face time. This is bad for our mental health and well-being. I want to find new ways to encourage conversations in a digital world and find ways to make our screens less distracting.


Use this space to tell the full story:

I've spent the past fifteen years working in the digital media sector. In that time I've come to understand that being online has led many of us to be less present in the physical world. We're so busy communicating that we don't have time to think or sit down and have a conversation. We're losing a sense of connection with others. This is bad for two reasons. The first is that we're missing out on the human connection, which I believe is key for our mental health and well-being. I want to find new ways to encourage conversations online and ways to make our screens less distracting.

I really enjoyed reading this, it"," For example, we're on the phone to our mom and she's telling us what to make for dinner at eight o'clock at night. We just got off the phone with someone we met at the pub ten minutes ago who we now know has three pints in them, so we put them on the table now that we're here. The internet and mobile connections have made many of our lives more efficient but have robbed us of real human connection. 
As you might expect in fifteen years my research has become dated and so my opinions have become obsolete. What will this mean for our society in the future where real human connection is so valued that we will no longer feel that we have to spend twenty minutes a day texting our friends to confirm that we're ok for an evening out - we'll be spending that time connecting with real humans face to face. 
This quote has implications for our society and so I would like you to write a piece that discusses this quote and also includes some of the research that has been documented to support your story.


Over the past fifteen years my research has documented that for many online life and smartphone connections have got in the way of things that people feel are important. We're so busy communicating that we don't have time to think we don't have time to sit down and have a conversation.

The research suggests that things we feel connected with (like marriage and religion) are declining as we lose touch with one another. We've also lost the physical connections that were so important in our youth. We're not spending as much time exercising and spending quality time with our friends and family. One reason is the disconnect that we feel on our smartphones.  

Based on the research, we have started using this app and website. We've found that it is extremely effective for us to be able to communicate with our friends and family when we are on the go and still be able to keep a conversation focused on the topic at hand. We have found it to be especially useful for having one-on-one conversations with our kids, whether it's on the train or in the car. We have also found it extremely useful for staying connected for longer periods of time while at the gym. I would highly recommend the website and the app to anyone who is feeling disconnected from others and wants to have a more fulfilling and active life!

The article provided is below the language and content scales:  

As the scale moves from left to right, the number of words in a passage is considered. One measure of readability is the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. This measure compares the number of words per sentence and the number of characters per word. A sentence is considered ""complex"" when it has ten or more words. Complex sentences are challenging to comprehend. A ""simple sentence"" has only five words per sentence. Simple sentences are easy to understand. 

The number of sentences in a passage is considered first. Simple sentences are contained in a single sentence, complex sentences contain at least two sentences. The number of sentences is divided by the number of words in each sentence, yielding a Flesch reading score which represents the average number of sentences required to understand a passage based on the number of words in the passage. 

The number of syllables per word is considered next, with a simple word having a single syllable, a complex word having two or more syllables, and a non-words having no syllables. 

The final readability score is computed by finding the average of the Flesch reading score"," We spend too much time working from home, on our smartphones and on the bus so that we don't have the time to exercise or spend time with family.

As a consequence, people are becoming less and less satisfied with their online connections. They want and expect more of what they are paying for. And they are increasingly turning to high-quality offline experiences. The study found that people are looking to go out to restaurants, bars and pubs, to visit museums, art galleries and to visit friends and family they haven't seen for a while. It also found that people are turning to experiences that aren't yet internet-enabled. They are now looking at experiences at theme parks, aquariums and even going to the dentist!

This is all very positive. More people are engaging with the offline world - and it is not just those who are wealthy. In contrast to the popular perception of what elite urbanites are doing, they are also going to the movies or the park, for example. Furthermore, this is happening in countries like Germany and the US where people may not have always had the ability to engage with the internet. It's not going away any time soon.

However, I was surprised by the study's last finding. It actually found that one of the factors that predicts satisfaction with online life is that people have more and better dental experiences. The connection between dental care and experiences that weren't online-enabled, in the digital era, is remarkable."

Hamlet responded 'My god, if you have any conscience, hear me speak: Here's the hand, that cashed the blood of Rolf, here's the arm, that did stab Polixenes—have you any sound judgment, speak.'

Read through the passage a second time, but this time using the names of the characters in the passage instead of Hamlet's name. Claudius' response'madness, how strong in reason's voice is heard! O, here's to your good health'. refers to Claudius, Hamlet's uncle, but the phrase also has a deeper meaning for younger learners. Claudius was Hamlet's advocate when Hamlet stood against his father and uncle. Claudius was an advocate for his client when he felt he was right. He would speak for his client when his client had no one else to speak for them. In the story, Hamlet's uncle, Claudius, was very supportive of Hamlet during his bad times and did not disapprove of his actions as other family members did.

The queen replies 'Oh, Hamlet you too have deep calls to forget, but let it serve' Hamlet continues his revenge, but then the king appears and declares that Hamlet is mad, and everyone, apart from Hamlet's mother and his girlfriend Claudius, thinks he is mad. The king orders that Hamlet be sent to a madhouse, and Claudius says: 'Come, mother, let's go, the air devours me.' Hamlet's mother refuses to go and Claudius shouts at her, saying 'Go, I dare not stay behind, this deathly air I cannot endure.' Hamlet's girlfriend Ophelia then appears, and Ophelia says that Claudius has been calling for Hamlet's mother all evening, and it is obvious that Hamlet is dead, since Hamlet was mad and could not attend to his affairs. Ophelia says 'There's a deal of grief among women, that's the plain truth.' Hamlet's mother then realises that Claudius is Hamlet's killer, and Claudius runs away. Hamlet's mother then tells Hamlet he is mad and she leaves. Hamlet sits in the dark and thinks 'Oh sweet madam, what should you wish in this hour of glory?' ('Sweet mother' is"," But when you spoke of my father just now I could not help thinking of my own.'

Let me take you on a journey through time, from the big bang to the discovery of evolution, the evolution of life on earth, and the theories of Charles Darwin.

The Theory of Evolution, by Charles Darwin

It is hard to believe that one human being could have created such change in the way we see ourselves in the world. The theory of evolution by natural selection is so profoundly altering the way we look at life and at the world.  Darwin's work in the study of species diversity and variation over time is so powerful that it has convinced many that the universe we live in was not fixed, but was designed, and designed for our enjoyment.

Darwin's groundbreaking work in the study of species diversity and variation over time is so powerful that it has convinced many that the universe we live in"," This process of natural selection creates unique and beautiful variations that lead to new, 'better' species.


Charles Darwin, born in Devon, UK, spent much of his childhood in London, where his mother had worked as a governess. He moved back to Devon when he was 6 years old, attending school there until the age of 15, and then moving to the village of Down in Somerset. This is where he began to write his groundbreaking book, On the Origin of Species.


When asked to write a preface for the 1872 edition of On the Origin of Species, Alfred Russel Wallace commented: ""I want greatly to acknowledge the great obligation which I feel to Professor C. Darwin for the loan of his Volume on the 'Origin of Species'. It is the most valuable contribution that I have ever received towards a clearer understanding of my own theory. Professor C. Darwin's noble spirit is exemplified throughout the book, and we feel how much we are all indebted to him for the clearness and strength of his thinking.""


While on leave from his naval duties in the Pacific, Darwin sailed down the west coast of South America on the ship, H.M.S. Beagle. He collected botanical samples and bird skins in his voyage, which proved to be critical in the development of his theory of evolution by natural selection.


Darwin's groundbreaking book changed the way we see ourselves and our place in the natural world. It also helped pave"," It is this process of natural selection which Darwin believed explains the diversity of life on Earth. 

Darwin's theory of evolution challenged established notions of Creationism, the belief that the world was created in seven days, at the end of the biblical period of 'Creation Week'. His theory met with great opposition, especially from the church who saw it as the 'destructive' (Christian) influence of the Darwin family and who cited the Bible as their authority. 

Darwin's faith and family tested throughout his adult life, especially when his children struggled with religious beliefs. Darwin's daughter Annie embraced Catholicism, his son Joseph embraced Anglicanism. Darwin's faith suffered after the death of his wife and eldest daughter in 1833. 

In 1859 Darwin published his revolutionary book On the Origin of Species. The book went through six editions before 1875, when it was finally banned in England and Wales.

In the 20th century, Darwin's theory of evolution was vindicated by discoveries of'missing links' between species, the discovery of transitional forms between existing species. Over 20 years of intense and creative research, the distinguished American paleontologist Dr. Alfred Romer declared in 1953 'The geological record speaks fluently of evolution'.

Today Darwin's theory of evolution is part of our cultural heritage. A large statue of Charles Darwin stands in Darwin Square in the heart of London's famous Science Museum and Darwin Centre. The British Academy, the Royal Society of London"," The theory of evolution also explains why some animals and plants are distinct from, and in some ways even more advanced than, others. 

Charles Darwin also faced opposition and discrimination over his ideas. His mother died when he was young and he was poor and an only child, which made it hard for him to afford the tuition at Cambridge University to read for a degree in natural history. Darwin began studying at Cambridge in 1831, aged only 15, and graduated with honors in 1836. After university he published the first edition of On the Origin of Species in 1859 to great critical acclaim. As a result Darwin came to be known by a shortened version of his name, ""Darwin"" rather than his full title.

Darwin was a strong advocate for women's rights, but was not accepted to Cambridge women were not allowed to study there until 1881. He died on the voyage home from a second voyage on the Beagle, where he had studied the distribution of plant and animal life on the Galapagos Islands. He was 55 years old.

After university he published the first edition of On the Origin of Species in 1859 to great critical acclaim. Darwin's revolutionary theory of evolution transformed"," Because of the importance of this theory to modern society, it was a personal challenge to Darwin that had a profound impact on the way he thought and wrote. He believed that he was not capable of writing a convincing argument in favour of evolution. As he explained himself, 'It requires not a little confidence in one's self and in one's powers of thought to venture on such a speculation.' In fact, it was his intellectual struggles with evolution that would ultimately lead him to his greatest scientific achievements. He was fifty-two years old when he began work on On the Origin of Species. He wrote it in less than a year. It is believed that he worked on the manuscript for four years, a task he found physically and mentally exhausting. During his work, he consulted with many respected scientists including Alfred Russel Wallace who came to his aid with supportive criticism. In a letter to his sister Caroline, Darwin wrote, 'I have worked like a Trojan, and am as proud of my work as a man could be who had conquered a difficult obstacle to the acquisition of some great final prize.' This was an important inspiration to him and he felt driven to complete his work. He also received encouragement from his friends and family. His sister Caroline wrote, 'If only one could look forwards to such an event in the future as that of the death of one's self, with the consciousness of having accomplished a work which would ensure the best tiding of mankind for many generations to come, that this","

On the Origin of Species was originally published in 1859, and"," In our increasingly technological and urban world we see evidence of this every day.  

Following Darwin, we can see that things, species and animals aren't immune to change and, in fact, that our very definitions of what is and isn't human are in flux. Darwin's theory of evolution has even led us to question our own place in the universe and our role on Earth. This theory has provided comfort to millions of people around the world as it explains how we can all be related and part of the natural order of things. 

Darwin's theory of evolution is in fact often misrepresented or even ignored by those in power and the powerful. Those who benefit from the status quo will attempt to preserve the status quo and keep you in the dark about key developments in the science of evolution and human society. This is why it is important for all of us to become familiar with Darwin's original ideas and research so that we can all benefit from and take part in this exciting and revolutionary science that could truly change the world we live in.

" We usually stayed in the guest house. My family owned the lodge and lived there year round. As is the case with many large estates by the sea, the grounds were kept up and maintained by a staff of servants and maids. 

As we were walking down the lane from the lodge to the sea a black labrador and her pups came bounding up to us. They were a little under a year old and despite being small in stature they were large in personality. They immediately circled around us and panted and licked our hands. We knelt down to pet them. One of the pups started to lick my hand. My mom took a picture. It was a nice sunny morning. We stayed for the next two weeks. 

The dogs quickly became part of our family. Over the years they have become very large members of our family. We can't imagine our lives without them. 

I hope you enjoyed the story.

"," The grounds were beautiful, and the sea was warm. The lodge had four large bedrooms all with kingsize beds, and there was a games room with pool, table football, table tennis, table cricket, table badminton, table billiards, darts, board games and a DVD player. Every morning we would wake up at 5am to watch the sunrise from the sea. Then we would swim in the sea before breakfast at 6am, and afterwards the four of us would go down to the beach for some beach life, and in the afternoon we would go to the games room to play board games and cards. It was great, and we would sit on the beach until it started to get dark. It was very relaxing. Once the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim.

Once the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County"," The lodge is a large, two story, whitewashed building with green shutters and large windows overlooking the beach and sea. The house itself was built in the 1700s by a wealthy fisherman who had three generations of his family live at the lodge. The current owners, an elderly couple, restored the old house and have added modern amenities such as a large master bedroom, a private dining room and a gym. Our room overlooked the beach and was a good size with two double beds, a chest of drawers and a wardrobe. It also had a large sea view window which looked out on to the beach and the sea. It was a bit shady on the side of the house nearest the window but you could usually find a tree to sit under or close by if the wind was from the right direction. That's how we spent most afternoons while on holiday. The rest of the month was spent in Ireland visiting the sights, tasting the food and exploring the country. It really is a beautiful place. On our first visit in June we had gone to the North Pole. It's an easy trip by boat and train and if you book in advance you can stay in a fancy hotel overlooking the ocean. When we returned from the North Pole we decided to spend a day in Belfast city centre and go to a football game. Ardbeag was going to the club called Glentown who play in the lower leagues. The stadium was on the opposite side of the city to"," Every year we would visit relatives and friends in Ireland and it seemed the right time to take a break from our travels and go to Glencorn Lodge.  We made a night train to Belfast, rented a car, drove across the border into County Donegal and then travelled along the north coast to Glencorn Lodge.  Arriving late at night we were surprised to find the house had been extensively remodeled and furnished in contemporary style. After checking in we found a small, cosy sitting room with a roaring fire that was the perfect place to decompress.  We had a wonderful four days visiting with family, swimming in the Atlantic Ocean and watching the seals on the shore.  On the last morning we got up early to make the four hour ferry crossing to the other side of the island.  Driving along a bumpy road we soon came to a huge, white sand beach that glistened in the morning sun.  On the beach we found the most amazing pile of white quartz rocks that glimmered in the sunshine, reminding us of the amazing clarity of the Atlantic Ocean water.  We stripped down to our swimsuit, walked out into the Atlantic and dove in to try and uncover the treasure ourselves.  Diving into the Atlantic Ocean was not a common experience for any of us but the exhilaration of finding the most beautiful collection of stones still gives us chills.  As we swam back to the beach, contemplating our next adventure,"," The house was owned by Dr. and Mrs. Murphy and their three grown-up children – Luke, Sinead and Ciara – as well as a housekeeper, Miss MacNamara, and a butler, Bill. Every June since the four of us were children, the Murphys used to host us for two weeks in the Glencorn Lodge house, which was located on the beach and offered an unlimited supply of fresh, warm water to bathe in. 

The Murphys often took us on day trips out of the area. On one such day in 2016, we visited Belfast, where we visited the Titanic museum and also drove to the town of Armagh, which is actually in Northern Ireland but is part of the Republic of Ireland. While in Armagh, we also visited the Ardagh Chalice, a famous holy well. In the evening, we went out for dinner to a restaurant called Johnny Rockets, which we all enjoyed very much. On the last night, the Murphys took us to a club called The Bataclan in Paris, where we saw a performance of the band Queen. We would have liked to have gone to see a musical in the evening, but were unable to do so because it was too late and the show had ended. In the coming weeks, we all kept in touch by phone, e-mail and text, and we wished each other a happy birthday at the beginning of the following June.

"," Once you've entered the gates there is a small lake with a small island in the middle. The house is set in about two acres of garden and lawn. In the garden there is a large old oak tree and there is a thatched barn for animals. We went hiking every day. We also swam a lot, though it was cold. And of course we went to the beach. It's not a large beach, but the water is quite deep there, so we liked that. We also explored the village of Ardbeag, where we bought some treats at the only shop. Everyone said it was great that four of us could be together like this and that it was a good idea to have more women on the trips. It was nice that we were not all men. We often talked about our families when we had a meal together in the big dining room. The house was very nice. The owners were very friendly. We all got along. They even took us on a boat trip in a lake. We also swam there. All in all, we had a really nice time. We were all very happy. It was just too bad that none of us realized this until one of the weeks were over. We arrived in Ireland on the Tuesday afternoon. We had a very lovely weekend planned. We walked around the old village of Ardbeag and had a meal on Saturday. On Sunday we went for a swim at the beach. And then we went to a"," The Lodge is surrounded by trees and the grounds are well kept. There is a small beach close by.

" The other competitors have made it to the top of a 72ft (22m) climbing wall and Francois has successfully reached the top of the world. He grins from ear to ear, he has just become the fastest person in the world to reach the top of the wall without using the stairs. The crowd erupts and the British team take home the gong for fastest.

Francois stands on the top of the wall, his fingertips just visible. He has already completed a few courses, but needs a perfect 100% for this World Cup event. He is feeling quite proud, as it was the first time in his climbing career that he had completed a course on the wall. To achieve this feat he had used only his feet, hands and a very long piece of string as a climbing rope. The last competitor on the course, Alexey Balandin, reaches the top of the wall first. Francois is disappointed, as he thought he would have the opportunity to win this competition again, but Alexey is quite happy with his achievement and tells Francois to get himself together and wait for the next competitor, who is currently climbing on the platform behind him.

While Francois is waiting, he watches the other competitors completing the next three courses. Some use hands, some use feet, others even strap themselves to the wall by the use of rope, but nobody completes a course with only the feet and hands as Francois is still stuck hanging by his fingertips!"," The climber has only 30seconds to finish the route, with no safety ropes or ladders to use. The route is to his advantage, however, as he has already tried to climb it once before, and remembers all the tricky sections.  Still, Francois starts to swing from hand to hand, not quite sure if he should grab a piece of the route with his teeth or his fingers, but with 30seconds remaining he watches helplessly as the fingers of his right hand slip from the wall. His last few seconds of consciousness, he looks down to see the palm of his hand hanging from the wall, inches from the ground. He closes his eyes, and with the last of his strength, kicks his feet towards the ground, just enough for his right foot to catch the edge of the wall as he comes down. His body lands on his head, and he is out.

The French climber Francois Lombard  ended up hanging from the wall above the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. The 30 second time limit was up, and Francois was out.

After the race the French climber Francois Lombard, went to the wall and looked down at his hand. He had managed to grab it with his fingers before he lost his grip, and had managed to make it to the ground without breaking any bones. Still, it was not good enough, and just a few hours after attempting to climb it for the first time, Franc"," Francois has to get high enough to reach a narrow gully in the wall. If he doesn't, he'll lose points. If he does make it, it will be a first for this type of competition. Francois gets high up on the climbing wall, but just barely, not quite reaching the gully. He falls. He has lost the competition. He drops down to the floor and hits his head. The next day he is found by his team at the hospital, not dead, but badly injured, and is rushed to the city's top-class hospital. They find a small fracture and a haematoma that require immediate treatment. They give Francois a painkiller and some antibiotics, and hope for the best. Francois recovers quickly, but is never quite the same again.


Francois Lombard, from the climbing wall, finds himself suffering from an accidental concussion and some nasty injuries. His fall from the wall was caused by his brain bursting due to a blood clot following a fall of about 6 feet.


Francois Lombard - the French climber who has fallen from the wall and suffered minor injuries, and who later goes on to win the World Cup Climbing Championships


Francois Lombard, the French climber who has fallen from the wall, suffered an accidental concussion and some nasty injuries. His fall was caused by a blood clot following a fall of about 6 feet. Francois Lombard - the French clim"," In the last 50 metres, the wall becomes extremely tight and slick. The fingers hold fast, but Francois is hanging in space and time. With an immense effort he manages to pull himself up the wall. A gasp of relief goes up the crowd. He stands on the other side and rubs his hands. It wasn't easy but he made it, and to celebrate he cracks open a beer. The others look at him with surprise. He shrugs his shoulders, takes a big gulp and passes the can to another climber. He climbs onto the platform with difficulty and holds the can by the neck. The other climbers all give him curious looks, but he ignores them and continues to guzzle down the beer.


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is a grade level assessment of the reading grade level of text on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 is a more expert grade level. Francois' climbs are described as challenging and the crowd holds its breath. Based on this text, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for this passage is 6, which is considered Advanced Reader grade level.


Francois made it to the other side of the climbing wall because the text described the wall as extremely tight and slick. The passage implies that Francois had to use considerable effort to reach the other side, but the text does not describe the difficulty of the climb.


The passage indicates that Francois drinks"," He is 53 years old and weighs 13 stone. At this height all the blood has drained from his face. The muscles in his hands feel like jelly. He starts his climb but hangs from only two fingers. A sigh of relief passes through the crowd. Then Francois swings back and begins the task of hanging from four. He hangs from four fingers for 10 minutes. It takes him 17 attempts but, after 17 minutes and 47 seconds, he manages to get three fingertips into the wall. He is the winner of the competition. The crowd erupts. He stands there for a few minutes feeling elated, before stepping off the wall. He is 51 years old and weighs 13 stone.

It takes Francois 47 seconds to achieve three fingertips into the climbing wall. If we assume that he was aiming for three fingertips from the beginning, and he was only targeting the fingertips, then he was successful in his attempt if he managed to get three fingertips into the wall after three attempts and 10 minutes of hanging from two fingers.

We can estimate how long it takes to achieve three fingertips into the wall based on the following formula:

Three fingers into the wall = 3 / (3 * 17) = 4 / 17 = 1.78 minutes

Weather in Birmingham could affect Francois' attempt. If the weather is not suitable, he could use two hands to assist with hanging from four fingers. With two hands and four fingers, Francois would need 11 minutes to achieve"," The climbers begin their climb. As they ascend, one by one their hands slip and they begin to go up the wall. But one by one the wall brings them safely down. The entire climb took only seven minutes.

**The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level** considers both the words and sentences in the passage. Francois Lombard described his climb as 'Once climbers went to the mountains. Now a challenging climb can be had anywhere indoors or out.' The words in this passage total to 47. The sentence count is 13 with three complete sentences. Francois Lombard is trying to climb a wall, but he slips each time. This means that the sentences in the passage are relatively short compared to words.

The"," He starts on the ground, going upside down and reaches for the wall.  One by one the other climbers on the wall move their hands to help him as Francois pulls himself up by his two fingers.  The crowd screams in elation as Francois hangs from the wall upside down, a picture of grace and ease. 
Climbers are given two minutes to reach the top. Francois pulls himself hand-over-hand up the wall, a picture of tenacity and skill.  One by one the rest of the climbers reach Francois, who reaches up to the top, a picture of triumph. 

It's not uncommon for people of all ages to go climbing, be it indoors or out.  Climbing in the wall is particularly popular among young people, who are looking for challenges and a sport to do at home instead of going to the gym or a running club. 
The competition at the World Cup Climbing Championships is particularly fierce, with even elite level athletes competing. 

To get to Birmingham, Francois has travelled from the south of France by Eurostar and will drive himself to the National Indoor Arena. For now, he's going to have a well-deserved rest as the wall comes to around 2 minutes remaining in the two-minute climb to the top. 

However Francois will still be wearing his climbing gloves, which are made from a very tough material to protect his hands from the rough"

The ARPAnet didn't just interconnect computers in one university campus - it connected computers in the whole city of Cambridge. In fact, the ARPAnet connected every computer in every university department, including those in the other universities in Cambridge - so it linked every computer in Britain to every other computer in Britain.

By 1983, the ARPAnet was bigger than the global Internet today. And it wasn't just big - it was growing faster. In a year the ARPAnet went from just one hundred nodes to over three thousand. In only two years, the growth was twenty times faster than the next largest network at the time.

But while the network was growing, so was it failing. As the number of nodes grew, so did the number of things that could go wrong - the computers themselves became slower, more complex, and more expensive. 

Even more worryingly, the computers were harder to fix than ever before. When a computer on the ARPAnet needed repairing, it was often miles away, in a university department that wasn't equipped to fix a problem that had cropped up in a computer in a city miles away. 

Even the scientists who ran the network had trouble fixing problems that occurred on the network. It's hard enough to run a network like the ARPAnet - much harder to fix it when it goes wrong. 

As the network expanded, its problems grew too. Problems began to"," There was the NSFnet which was set up by the National Science Foundation (the US government's research organisation) and the University of Utah. It was much smaller, with only about a million nodes, and it connected several smaller networks together. These networks were used by academics to communicate with each other across different machines and these academic networks themselves were very important too. Without them the development of information technology in the US and worldwide may have been impossible. However these academic networks were also set up more simply by schools and universities to communicate with each other across smaller networks. This was done using ARPAnet programs called ""clusters"". These clusters allowed computers to talk to each other and to communicate using regular mail programs. There were clusters set up between computers in Utah and computers in California and in England. These clusters allowed academics and businesses to communicate and share information across networks. So now there were multiple computer networks which all used the ARPAnet protocol. The Internet was born!

The Internet had its origins in the ARPAnet in the 1960s and it continues to develop to this day, now numbering over 6 million computers worldwide. The Internet is a worldwide network of computers linked by telephone lines that are able to communicate with each other. By using a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Chrome, you can send a message to a website hosted by another computer on the internet.

The Internet also has sub-networks called ""Internets"". Each Internet is made up"," This was the first computer network. It was called the ""Internet"" and was hosted by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications at the University of California at Berkeley. The Internet was founded by the US Department of Energy and the Internet Society and was open to all users. Users could now communicate with one another and exchange information from any computer on the Internet. The Internet still had the same limitations as the ARPAnet.  It was only connected to other Internet host computers. It still was only for people who knew how to use the TCP/IP protocol and was only available over high cost private networks. This was going to change with the invention of the internetworking protocol (IW) that would allow the Internet to communicate over ordinary public networks such as the telephone network.

The Internetworking protocol (IW) became operational in 1987. It allowed the ARPAnet and the Internet to communicate and exchange information from any computer on the Internet

Internetworking protocol (IW)"," These included the NSFNET, also known as the internet, which was set up by the National Science Foundation in the United States in the early 1980s. The internet too was built and run by computers that had been connected to the ARPAnet, but unlike the ARPAnet it was not open, which made it much harder to get people to connect to it. 

In America after the 1970s a number of different computer networks began to appear, including the ARPAnet, the NSFNET, and local area networks (or LANs).

National Science FoundationNET 

The National Science FoundationNET (also known as the internet or the internetwork) was an American computer network initiated in the early 1980s and operated by private organizations. It was open to the public but much less open and more expensive than the ARPAnet. The NSFNET was funded by the National Science Foundation and ran across America at the same time that the ARPAnet was running in Europe. It was initially set up to handle the enormous increase in computer networks needed to access and use the growing number of university computer systems in the United States. By the mid-1980s, the NSFNET was handling as many as 500 million network connections per day, about 25% of the traffic on the ARPAnet.

 The national science foundationNET (also known as the internet or the internetwork) was an American computer network initiated in the early 1980s and operated by"," One network was called the NSFNET. It was similar in design to the ARPAnet, but it used different physical media. It consisted of nodes running Linux. Instead of high-speed ethernet cables it used phone lines. It was called the Networked Science Foundation. And although it was very similar to the ARPAnet it used a completely different technology.

Although most of the problems were small, some of them were not. The most popular newsgroup on the ARPAnet was often full of spam messages. And although spam was only a problem for a very small number of users there was very little anyone could do about it. So to stop spam most email servers used a method called blacklisting. They sent a list of email addresses to a server somewhere else, and if the server received a request for an email address from that server it would reject the request. It was this way of stopping spam that had led to the development of the Internet and email.

But in the early days of the Internet it worked fine and there was no spam. Then one day the server got a very large request, a request to send spam. And the server replied ""spam"" instead of ""ham"". To everyone's surprise there was actually no spam. But the request had been for an email address on the ARPAnet and everyone just assumed there would be spam. The news was soon all over the internet, and everyone on the ARPAnet found"," These included the NSFnet (Network for Scientific Computing) and the CCITT X.25 networks. These networks used specialised data links, together often called telephone networks, to link computers together. This allowed large databases to be created and information to be shared. The CCITT networks were for signalling only and were not used for data communication. However these networks did introduce the concept of switching which allowed one computer to communicate with another by setting up a data link to a specific address (known as a port) in a specific computer. When several computers wanted to communicate to a single destination computer they all dialled the same number in the destination computer. This destination computer then looked up the relevant address and set up a link to that destination address in the first computer. Each address could then be thought of as a telephone number and the computers could dial this number and communicate with each other via a telephone network. The first networked computer to talk to a specific destination address was announced by the telephone company, AT&T, in 1969. This made a major contribution to the growth of the field of computer science as now large computer databases could be shared between many different types of computers. 
This computer network, called the Internet, is used to communicate with computers around the world. 
The Internet can be thought of as a huge network of specialised data links called telephone networks, linked together by switches that are able to communicate with any other switch on the network. The Internet consists of many", And although the ARPAnet showed that a computer network could be useful there still was little that could be done with it. Another computer network had been set up. It was called the NSFnet. This network was more like a large network of telephone lines than a computer network. It could be used for sending messages between computers and people could dial up the computer network with their telephones and communicate with one another over the telephone network. However the main difference between the ARPAnet and the NSFnet was that the ARPAnet was only about twenty-five computers wide while the NSFnet was much wider with hundreds of thousands of computers linked together. The ARPAnet was not as useful as this wider computer network and this wider computer network was not as useful as the ARPAnet. Although this computer network had been created and was in operation for a much longer period than the ARPAnet it is still considered to be of the A2 level of difficulty. The reason for this is that although the number of machines in the network was much greater than the number of machines in the ARPAnet it still had a simple design with few gates and very few paths between the machines in the network. The design was very similar to that of the ARPAnet although the NSFnet was much wider and had more machines. And although the design was simple the number of machines in the NSFnet meant that the problems which could be solved by the machine were limited.

Chris was an extremely talented sportsman as well as a good student. In addition to his height, he was an exceptionally fast runner and a strong swimmer, with the ability to jump fifteen feet from the high board. He also had excellent agility and coordination. His parents and teachers were so proud of him and believed his ambition to be a sailor was both possible and achievable.

When he was offered a place at a top public school, he decided against it. He would be a better sailor if he went to sea and would probably do better academically if he studied for his university exams and got a good grade, but he could already do both in his new home port.

The war came early for Chris. At eighteen, he was sent to the submarine service where he worked his way up from ratings to mid-shipman. He was an outstanding, highly regarded seaman and his superiors were all very proud of him and believed he would go far in the navy.

When war came again a few years later, it wasn’t as severe a test for Chris as it had been for other people, but he still served on the ocean floor. There were a few near misses and a couple of near capsizes, but mostly Chris found the war very enjoyable. It was a chance to test himself in many ways that had not been possible during peacetime. As a mid-level officer he participated in many highly successful and exciting operations, such","

  * Chris wanted to be a sailor but his height prevented that from happening. His teacher had a point!

Chris was determined to go to sea and become a naval flagpole, so his teacher helped him go down the navy recruitment office. 'I know this might be a tall order, but the navy is always looking to find recruits, and will give you a job when you join. And remember - you can come back here to school if you need help along the way. And your teacher will be there for you!', the teacher added.

Although Chris was very proud to join the navy he wasn’t quite tall enough. But his teacher’s help and support helped him to achieve his goal of becoming a naval flagpole.

  * When you try something that you really want, you need help! In this story Chris’s teacher helped him go to the navy recruitment office to find a job in the navy. Chris found out that he was too tall for the navy but his teacher helped him to join and became a naval flagpole.

* The navy (or the sea for that matter) can help to bring out the 'Chris' in people!

  * If you want to achieve a goal, ask for help to help you. People may be able to help you achieve your goal. The navy (or the sea for that matter) can help to bring out the ‘Chris’ in people.

  * Help! Help!"," And he had a perfect complexion and light brown hair which in the navy he would be able to tan to a deep bronze. The navy wasn’t the only opportunity the teacher’s question had opened up though - Chris’s father, a steelworker, had recently been laid off and the family’s fortunes had turned. In the end, he decided to give his options a try. In the navy, he learnt to swim and how to drive a motorboat. And his complexion and hair lightened and tanned. For his last two years of high school, Chris wore his academy swimwear on the school pool deck and his girlfriend’s father even gave him a credit card so he could take a family vacation every year to Florida. The navy gave him self esteem as well as the chance to work with the US military and help people in need. It was, he told his parents, the best decision he’d ever made. 
The navy is more than just a career option for Chris Greener. It was actually the best choice he ever made. It helped him find inner confidence, helped him grow, helped him feel important. It made him a selfless member of a team who was always ready to help people and make the world a better place. So, I’d like to tell kids who want to follow a life of service that the navy isn’t just an option, it’s a chance to make a real difference in people’"," But this was not enough for the navy, so Chris tried a more challenging ambition. 'I want to sail around the world to show my dad I can do it' was Chris’s true ambition. 'That’s a great ambition' said the teacher 'and we’ll have to have a go at making a flag at the same time to commemorate the occasion'.

Chris Greener wasn’t always this tall. When he was fourteen he was just over 1 metre tall. In fact, he was shorter than half the population of Australia. When he joined the navy he was still 14 years old, but by the time he was leaving school he was already over 2 metres tall.

Chris told the truth here - he was not always this tall, but he started to develop his ambition to join the navy when he was 14. The story shows that he considered different ambitions as he developed. He kept his goal simple - to join the navy - but his ambition increased as he tried more challenging ambitions.

The teacher’s comment that Chris’s ambition was a great one was based on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale that measures how easy or difficult a text is to read. The scale ranges from 20, where the text is very easy to understand, to 100, where the text is very difficult to understand. In this story, Chris’s text was very easy to understand as he told the truth and the teacher's response was"," And with his height he’d have plenty of room to spread his navy surplus kit, and the flag and pole idea was surely the right next step for the hard-to-reach sailor. The navy did not share these thoughts. 'Well, you could be a helicopter pilot', they said. 'It’s a noble calling' - Chris agreed - 'but that’s four metres tall!' 'And I want to be a sailor', said Chris - the right size and nearly two. 'Oh', sighed the navy, 'that’s just between you and your flag and pole'. Not to be deterred, Chris went back to the navy and asked them again: 'but what are my chances of making it to four metres tall?' This time they consulted a height-testing agency, and it turned out there were not many sailors under three metres tall. But Chris still got the chance, and so he became a naval sailor, and went around the top of three metres. But then he realised you needed a much bigger ship to carry all the people and things at the top, so he was grounded at that. 'I just don’t have the height', he explains. 'The navy aren’t interested'. 'Well, don’t look to me like you have much of a future in the navy', replied the boss - 'you’re a tall sailor in a short navy'. 'I suppose', said Chris, 'then'. This story reminds me of an"," 'No. When I'm at school I like to take photographs with my dad's big camera and put the photos in special frames. I like to draw pictures of ships and planes and make models of battleships and submarines.' The teacher wasn't convinced, and Chris didn’t tell her where he got his ideas for what he wanted to do. She said he’d have to try out for a selection and find out. Chris got through the navy's selection test and found out he got a job as an oiler on a destroyer. So he spends a lot of time looking at stars in the navy’s darkroom and looking at pictures of ships. He also has a small collection of naval warships in plastic wrap in his bedroom. When he’s not at school doing school things, Chris plays football and goes to the gym to train. 

Chris has just over ten thousand words, but is considered a Grade 2 level reader.

Chris had better be a Grade 3 level reader to really appreciate this.  The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level has nothing to do with reading ability.  It’s based on a measurement of how easy a text is to read, with Level 1 being the easiest and Level 12 the hardest.  If you are not a native English speaker, the Flesch-Kincaid reading level is even harder to understand.

  The words, sentences, and syllables for Chris are: 
  10"," He didn't have a problem with the boots - he'd always felt taller than everyone around him growing up in a working class family in a small town in south Lincolnshire. The navy was definitely his route to fame and fortune - he knew the navy loved tall fit young lads and he'd also read somewhere that navy ships had become the flagships of super powers in the past. So despite what most of his friends at school thought he signed up for the navy. He joined, trained and three years later found himself on a troop ship in the middle of the Atlantic as the war broke out. It was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to him and he knew it was the right thing to do but he was so very tired. And very homesick. And he didn't know how he was going to send enough money home to support his mother. But he had a promise his mother made to him before he was even born that he would be the tallest person in the world.

" He had this young chef named Paul who I thought had great potential. But of course, that didn't matter to me as he was my son. Paul was not very good but my son took to it like a fish to water. And he quickly showed me. He was a natural, he had an amazing understanding of food and wine, he had a good eye for taste and of course he was a great cook. 
  So I didn't say a word, I just put my arm around him and said ""Let's do this."" 
  Paul started doing a great job and I began to see my restaurant succeed. Paul's fame started to grow as the years went by. His TV shows became hits and he started a clothing line and a wine brand. I became friends with his wife Nicole and they had a baby girl. My son's fame continued to grow and he was now a best selling author and cookbook author. 
  When I say his fame grew so much I mean it. He was now known all around the world. 
  But as his fame grew so did my feelings. I wanted more from him. I wanted him to be with me forever.  
  We started seeing other people and getting closer again but I was still not saying anything. One day I caught him cheating on me and now we are divorced. And as you can imagine things got much worse from there. 
  As I sat there I realized that even though I did not say anything"," To my surprise it looked like a time machine of a restaurant from the 50's. I was amazed. There was a red vinyl wall to the kitchen with copper pots hanging from the ceiling. There was a long table set in front of the window. Weeks later I went back to check the progress. Gary had decorated it with the retro furniture and colorful linens. It looked just like the picture. My heart filled with excitement. This was going to be a night to remember for both of us. The night of the event we decided to hold a party to celebrate his success. It was so successful that the guests begged for more. I knew this was not going to be possible so we came up with a plan to add a room to our already busy place. The room was not to become fully operational for weeks. The plan was to use the space to show the dishes prepared on that night. He was to present the dishes that were most popular, the ones that brought in the most customers and so on. We divided the room in half with the public half in the middle. The back half was the small kitchen where we would prepare the dishes. To the front of the room there was a wide window. Through this window we would show the dishes to the crowd. This part of the room wasn't ready yet so we set up a small stage in the middle. My son Gary and a few of the most popular cooks would perform a short set of their most popular dishes. During the"," It was tiny and a little bit shabby but my hopes were high. The first night I served the most complicated meal I'd ever cooked. There was pasta with lobster, bouillabaisse, shrimp risotto, beef carpaccio, grilled swordfish, grilled calamari, lobster mousse, and a beautiful bottle of Chianti Classico. Gary came into the dining room with his wife and daughter. He knew what to order. The family was excited and the check came to $12,000 which I thought was a bit much. After the dinner was served, Gary came to my side of the dining room and said he was going to need a loan to keep the restaurant afloat. He said ""dad, I cooked this meal and everything tasted so great. Why don't we just leave the restaurant and split the profits?"" I looked over at him, my mouth open. He continued, ""You should have seen my father when I was a kid. He kept telling me I had no talent. He made me stand up at the dinner table every night and read from the Yellow Pages. That's how I met your mother. I was good at sales and she liked what I had to say."" I was speechless. I couldn't believe my ears. I looked at his wife, she was crying. I turned to my daughter and said. ""Let's go home and I'll give you the business plan and we can talk about it tomorrow","  I could sense something wasn't right. He just didn't have the experience and was not ready for a high end restaurant. I told him to just be himself and go for it. We opened the doors and it was a huge hit. People said it was the best food and service they had had in years. The critics started coming around. They complimented us on every detail. It was surreal. The restaurant was packed every night and the critics were raving. When the final review came out we both were shocked. It was glowing reviews and a  score of a perfect 10.  That night I looked over at my son and said, ""Son this is exactly what I always wanted for you. I will always be here for you if you ever need me."" He smiled back and replied, ""Thanks Dad."" This letter is dedicated to him.

There are 2 aspects to this prompt. The first is that the text needs to be understandable by Grade 2 learners. I'd be happy to provide references at this stage to texts that I'm personally familiar with that are at Grade 2 or above.

The second aspect is the idea of giving your 'chance in life'. A few texts include references to opportunity - for example: 'When I heard about the opportunity I rushed over to look at the place.

The menu was exciting and the ambiance was perfect. I knew I had to do it. I prepared the first ever steak and kidney pie and the critics seemed to like it. So the next day, I prepared another steak and kidney pie and wow! My father was over the moon. He was now certain I had it in me to run a successful business. We continued like this for a few years. I now look back with pride at how my father had shown faith in me. The relationship that had developed was priceless. My son Gary would go on to be world-famous as a TV chef. I could not have done it without him.

I believe everyone's given a chance in life, so let this be a lesson to all parents to show their children that there is nothing to be ashamed of. There is always room for improvement.

Innovative Restaurant in Oxford

Gary and Me The restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary the famous TV chef. I believe everyone's given a chance in life. My son Gary was given his chance with cooking and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity I rushed over to look at the place. What a fantastic restaurant my father had created. The menu was exciting and the ambiance was perfect. I knew I had to do it. I prepared the first ever steak and kidney pie and the critics seemed"," I asked lots of questions and said yes my son could cook but I need to see some references. After a few weeks I was told no references needed I could smell and taste the food. I tried it and said yes my son can cook. A few weeks later the new opening night and the staff were talking about the famous chef from Vancouver BC and he also my son. We had many famous customers that week. I was so happy for both of us.

" But, as a third generation British-Chinese, she tells us that her family have been coming to Switzerland for generations and it is second nature for her now to be looking after the chalet. She says: ""Being a chalet girl is great fun. I get to enjoy the day in as much ways as I can. ""I get to go shopping, I get to cook delicious dinners, and I get to help the clients to make their stay as enjoyable as possible. It is an opportunity to use my passion for food and Chinese medicine."" ""It is a great way to learn the culture of Switzerland. It is a fun and a new experience to spend the day with other families who are also looking after the chalet and learning from a more experienced person about different aspects of Swiss culture."" But Sarah admits it can also be hard work. She says: ""I think of it as a great opportunity to experience new things and learn about different cultures. ""But at the same time, you can feel a bit lonely when you are on your own, especially when there are many of us, like the chalet staff, and we are all on our own for a week. It can be challenging, but it is also a real opportunity to build strong relationships with the chalet owners."" And Sarah is not the only chalet girl from around the world working in the Swiss Alps. There are many, including from Europe, the US, Singapore, Japan"," Her job is to make people feel welcome and comfortable in their chalet. 

Sarah has worked in the hospitality industry for many years and says it has been a natural progression to move into this field. Her favourite part is the warm cosiness and hospitality people receive. She loves the food, the beautiful nature and spending time with her friends and family.

Chalet Girl Veronica Lee from the West Midlands visited a chalet recently. She was particularly taken by the way Sarah looked after and entertained the guests, as well as the tasty meals that came along with them.

Chalet Girl Veronica Lee from the West Midlands visited a chalet recently. She was particularly taken by the way Sarah looked after and entertained the guests, as well as the tasty meals that came along with them. She has just graduated from a hospitality course, and would like to be a chalet hostess one day. 

Sarah has been working as a chalet girl for two years and she loves what she does. She has also worked in the hospitality industry for many years and has found a natural progression into this. She especially enjoys the cosiness and warm hospitality she provides for the guests. She is particularly fond of the way she looks after her guests and makes them feel welcome. 

Sarah says her favourite part of the job is making people feel comfortable and making them welcome in their chalet. She loves making the beds, making the drinks"," This is her job so she can continue to provide for her ailing parents who have both chronic illness. While her friends are out drinking Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is the go-to person for the little things that make holidaymakers comfortable. She lays out their towels and is responsible for the bar. Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is on call 24/7 for any request so they don't have to stand in line. She can get them anything they want to make their holiday the most memorable. During this past winter's snowstorms she was kept busy making sure the tourists weren't stranded in the snow. She even helped a member of the British royal family which was an unexpected and overwhelming experience. Sarah Sutherland-Pilch and her father, who manages the chalet, live in the village of Fiez-Prémeaux but travel to Chalet de Rameau in the Jura mountains. The chalet has six bedrooms and can sleep 14 people. When asked what she does for fun, she says, ""I like spending time with my family, hanging out with friends and going to the gym.""  The chalet has a spa and a pool where you can while away the time reading a book or soaking up the view of the mountains. The chalet is nestled on the southern slopes of Mont Blanc and the Jura Mountains and is only a 15-minute helicopter ride from the ski station"," ""All the hard work and preparation is worth it, seeing children and adults smile because they can relax and enjoy themselves, that's what life's all about. It's not about the money or the luxuries, it's about making people happy and they can see that when they're at the chalet"", Sarah says. The work of a chalet girl - also know as an alpaca - starts after a couple of weeks of planning in which Sarah puts together all the right things to make the chalet a success, such as holiday-maker-specific menus, chalet essentials, such as hot water bottles, milk and tea, but also games and crafts for children, like puzzles and picture books. Then it's on to putting the chalet together, with Sarah and her team of five full-time staff and four chalet managers responsible for the daily upkeep of the chalets. On these last weeks Sarah has a lot on her plate. She spends her days cleaning, polishing and cooking for up to 200 guests, as well as dealing with emergencies such as a chalet that is too cold or too hot. But with all the work, Sarah's not short on time: it takes her between 5 and 6 hours a day to take care of everything. ""I like the flexibility and challenge. It keeps me on my toes but it also leaves enough time for my own needs. There's a lot of variety in the job so"," ""This is the best job in the world, it feels good to make people comfortable,"" says Sarah. ""I would love to travel the world as a chalet girl because it's very interesting and new, I meet lots of different kind of people. ""They enjoy my food, my fresh bread, my flowers, and my calm and smiling personality."" The English chalet-girls' reputation is assured in these hard-working times when many British workers are unable to find other work. But with holidaymakers returning to their villas with a sense of calm restoration, there is an ever growing demand for the service of a chalet girl, who is dedicated to making their stay in the resorts as pleasant as possible. ""The job is very enjoyable, very interesting, and very good pay,"" says German tourist Christoph. ""What's more, the chalet girl looks after the comfort of the guests, such as the cleanliness of the rooms and the bathrooms. She also puts flowers in the rooms and does other small but nice things for the guests."" Sarah is happy to work for a lower salary than her British counterparts who are paid more, to provide the same level of service. She acknowledges however, that her customers are worth it, given the benefits of having a British chalet girl at your disposal. ""People like me, the local people, they know me here, so they know I can be trusted, and I can do a good job,"" says"," And she couldn't be happier. ""I love the excitement of getting people into the chalet and keeping them happy for a night,"" she says. And although she enjoys seeing holidaymakers return again and again, her favourite part of the job is hearing them talk about her meals. Sarah says: ""People usually say how wonderful my meals are and when they taste one they often request me to make them again. It's so nice to see people enjoying the food we make!"" Her favourite meal to make is roast pheasant with root vegetables and butternut squash, which she says her parents helped prepare many years ago for her brother's wedding. Sarah learned her chalet skills while helping her family look after other people's property and so was well prepared to take on the chalet job. And since she has three younger siblings of her own and so knows how much work it can be keeping everyone happy, she says she loves the responsibility of making sure they have a good time. ""I think I'm pretty good at my job because I can multi-task and make sure everyone is happy,"" she says. Although she enjoys working with people, Sarah's favourite meal to make is her own - because ""I like to plan it and because I can be creative with different fillings"". Veronica Lee is a teacher from the UK.


Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scores 9 to 11 are at a college level; scores below 9 are considered difficult for general"," While she's happy to work on a tight schedule, she says there's nothing quite as satisfying as making guests happy. 
For Sarah, being a chalet girl is a dream job. Her family has been in the trade for seven generations. 

""It's very satisfying to help make their holiday an enjoyable experience,"" she says. ""I really enjoy making their beds and making sure everything's clean. It's a great way to use my training in health and safety."" 

Having worked in the hospitality sector for six years, Sarah says she's picked up some valuable tips along the way. 

""We always make sure our rooms are lovely and clean and we make sure all the amenities are available, including towels, shampoo and cleaning supplies,"" she says. ""A lot of people appreciate being treated with courtesy and respect."" 

Another bonus: Sarah can spend time with her three-year-old son. 

""Being able to spend time with my son is another nice side effect. We go to the swimming pool at the chalet and to the nearby village to do activities. This gives me some much-needed downtime to enjoy the sunshine with him."" 

And enjoy the sunshine she does. Sarah's chalet is just one of the stylish and vibrant mountain lodges built in the French Alps for tourists. She says that being near the mountains helps to soothe her soul. 
""I love the French Alps"

""We are born with an innate desire to run fast and we can run fast for many years,"" Ashcroft said. ""But we then reach a point where our bodies cannot run any faster. This is known as our 'human speed limit'. It varies between individuals, but it would be reasonable to assume that by the age of twenty, most of us have reached our speed limit. 

What happens to us when we stop running fast? Our bodies actually become stronger and better at running slower. And, we find other ways to stay active such as swimming, or playing sports such as squash or table tennis. In a sense, then, running fast is not such a good thing after all. 

What is the human speed limit? It's a really good question and it's something that Ashcroft and her colleagues from the University of Oxford are currently researching. It's a pleasure to live our lives, to get out of bed every morning and to do the things we do. And running fast or running hard isn't necessarily a good thing or even possible. We can live a long time, we should enjoy the time we have and running fast or running hard can take away the joy of living.""


El Guerrouj's time of three minutes twenty-six seconds was broken by Abderramin Hailemariam in 2003 who ran 3:28.27. Hailemariam went on to set the current indoor world record for the mile (","


On 20 April 2015 the world-renowned distance runner compatriot of Hicham El Guerrouj, Yemini Davis also became the first woman to run a sub-three-minute mile. Her time of 3:58.46 remains the second-fastest in the world today.

Achieving sub-three-minute miles has long been the goal of distance runners, and indeed, of all runners, as research on muscle and brain physiology during exercise has demonstrated that human beings can deliver speeds of up to over two miles per hour during a run, and can continue to deliver even higher speeds for longer periods of time.[1] However, in recent years we have seen a distinct decline in the performance of runners who set out to achieve such times. It has been suggested that this decline may be due to a combination of factors, including fatigue, improper nutrition, and exposure to toxic elements such as lead and cadmium found in some sport supplements, as well as other environmental factors.[1][2]

Sub-three-minute miles have always been the goal for runners, with many even attempting to run slower than two minutes. However, the potential to run slower than two minutes remains tantalisingly within reach of runners if they avoid over-extracting caffeine, do not crash their bodies during training, and increase their consumption of carbohydrates and healthy fats, for example by avoiding the use of sport supplements.[3]


Despite the ever-"," She says that during a typical marathon, our bodies are under extraordinary strain:  

“Our organs are working harder, faster and longer. The oxygen and glucose supply to the muscles is more abundant, and it’s more efficient. We’re able to do more of the same because the recovery time is reduced. The athletes' bodies have adapted to a high volume, high stress lifestyle. Marathon running is no longer a game of skill - it’s a test of will to the limits of the human system.”

In what way do you think the marathon is a test of the human system? Why do you think Hicham El Guerrouj never broke the 1500-metres world record again? 

The average American runner can cover about twenty-miles a day. At this pace you could run all the way from New York to Washington D.C. in about twenty-two days. However, marathon running requires a lot more than the average person is able to manage. In order to run a complete marathon you must be able to sustain this pace for twenty-two days. How much training do you need to do to be able to run a marathon?  The answer is that the amount of training required depends on a number of factors including your baseline fitness level, the distance of the race you are running, and your training schedule.  If you want to train to run a marathon you should consider running a minimum of ten miles a day, three","

Frances Ashcroft is the Professor of Physiology at the University of Oxford and, at the age of 70, is still racing. Hicham El Guerrouj is an athlete who is world-class in distance running. In 1998, at the age of 31, he broke the 1500-metre world record. Following this he went on to set the 200-metre, 400-metre and 800-metre world records, becoming the only person to hold all of these records at one time. He is a three-time Olympic gold medallist and was the world record holder for ten years.

After breaking the world record Hicham continued to train, as he always had done. Although he continued to work hard and trained harder, he found his pace to be unchanged. Fifteen years later, the question of whether or not Hicham could still break the world record again arises. His competitors are much older now and his body is much fitter. Do we, as a society, have reached the ""human speed limit""? Frances Ashcroft explains.

In a race you only have a certain amount of energy, known as your ""munition"". Once that ammunition is used up, you are either unable to regain it or, if you are able to regain it, you have to use it very carefully and carefully, or you will exhaust yourself. There is a limit to how fast you can go. In a race against a much","


Frances Ashcroft is an expert on the field and body strategies during sport, having researched and written the internationally acclaimed book  Coachspeak: The How of High Performance Sport. She leads a group of coaches and exercise physiologists at the Institute of Physical Education and Performing Arts (KEP) in Qatar. She has contributed chapters to the book Female Physique and Physique Competitive Leagues Around the World: An Analysis of the Current Global Competition Paradigm and published a second edition of her first book, Coachspeak, following on from the success of the 1st edition of Coachspeak which was published in 2003.


During a recent overseas trip, Professor Ashcroft was invited to deliver a lecture in Morocco on the topic of 'The limits of the human body'. She brought a large number of practical examples from her work with elite athletes around the world, as well as from her own research, to share with the Moroccan public. The video of her lecture is below: 

The Moroccan government supported the organising committee of the event and Professor Ashcroft was warmly received by the local press and public at large. The event went ahead in the city of Fez as part of the 'Fez Sports Festival' and Professor Ashcroft's lecture was shown live on local television.

The Moroccan press praised Professor Ashcroft's contribution and highlighted her expertise on the topic. The Moroccan news site Omnikeen"," She explains that the body has several systems to help keep athletes safe during hard training sessions and competition. These systems include providing oxygen to the muscles to help build energy and the blood, keeping the heart healthy with sufficient blood flow, and making sure muscles receive the required nutrients to keep them strong and ready to take on the task at hand. She explains that the body has several limits beyond which it cannot sustain higher workloads. 

The body's limit on sustained high workloads includes its capacity to: 

- deliver enough oxygen to every square inch of muscle 

- keep the heart beating without becoming too excited 
- supply enough nutrients to each muscle cell.

Given that the world-record-holder 1500-metre runner has not beaten his time since 1998, it would seem that we have reached the human speed limit. 

Ashcroft states that the human body's limit on sustained high workloads includes its capacity to:

  
- deliver enough oxygen to every square inch of muscle 

- keep the heart beating without becoming too excited 
- supply enough nutrients to each muscle cell.

  

So why haven't the world-class 1500-metre runners been able to get faster since 1998? Professor Ashcroft believes there are a few reasons including the athletes being selected based on talent, good luck, and having a family background in athletics that helps them develop a strong focus. She also says that we need to look to other sports such as"," 'After fifteen to twenty minutes of a good race you become a liability because your body no longer works as fast as it should.  

Over that time your lung capacity has decreased;  you may become hypoxic; your muscles lose their ability to pump blood; the size of your spleen shrinks as it takes its share of the damage of the race; your red blood cells get damaged; and your white blood cells fail to keep up with your needs. In the words of the American journalist Jonah Lehrer,  the body doesn't know how to stop. And so, by the time you get to the end, you're so physically spent that your brain doesn't know what to do with you, and so you need some kind of handout, like a doctor or a medic. You're just an object, not a person, after a long race, and there isn't enough blood available to keep all the organs working at top efficiency. So you are slower, but not much slower, and that means you can race for longer.' 

Dr Frances Ashcroft Professor of Physiology at Oxford University was a runner herself. She explains that running has many benefits. It makes you feel good and it increases your confidence, and it makes you feel connected to your local community by giving a sense of wellbeing that doesn't exist anywhere else. She also explains that, while running helps you to maintain good health, it is important to remember that it is a sport that has many dangerous"

" Susan loves these plants and encourages them to grow even though they are not always well behaved. 

The tulips and poppies in Susan's garden typically include varieties that are a hit with tourists. 

While tourists may enjoy the display, Susan's garden is a sanctuary for plants that have adapted well to the local soil and climate and tend to be a bit wild.

It is now an integral part of the garden. 

Susan enjoys these visitors but they sometimes have the unexpected effect of encouraging the rarest and most delicate plants in her garden to grow a bit wild and unruly. 

The garden is her own, created to express her own ideas and beliefs about what a garden should be and she enjoys having visitors to enjoy it and share it with others. The visitors have the effect of inspiring others to take up gardening and the garden becomes a source of beauty and enjoyment for all.

The passage should conclude by describing Susan as someone who enjoys the wildness in her garden and the result is a sanctuary of beauty and delight for all who visit.

I didn't set out to plan a life like this for myself, that's just what happens - that's life.' 'Ah, I see,' he says, 'then you have led a very happy life so far!' Matthew blushes and stammers. 'Well - I suppose so!' he says. 

Which response would you give Charles?

  * I'm sorry, I don't understand. Matthew, tell Charles what you imagined. 
  * I imagined that we would go to the pub for a pint, have a meal in a local cafe, then go to the park and play frisbee.

*"," 'It depends who the woman is. If the woman is pretty then yes, marry her and have many children. If the woman is not pretty or not very good with kids then it is best to stay single. In my experience, women are not very good at predicting who will be good parents. Mostly it is about being a good partner to share life with. Do you think that is the case with you and Claire?' 'Well yes, I suppose so.' Charles is very relieved. 'Good. Then Claire will be a good parent, she is very good looking and loves to spend time with me. Go and find her.' 
So Charles goes to find Claire and sees her sitting on the sofa with another man. She looks sad. Charles comes up to her and asks her what is wrong. Claire whispers in his ear and then says to the crowd, ""Charles went to find me and I am with this new man"". Charles is very angry, but the happy groom walks up to him and says ""Charles has a good point, but I am the best man and I say you should marry her!"", so Charles gets the happy bride to dance. 'The happy bride' means that Charles is a good partner and Claire should be happy.


Then Claire and Charles get married, they have a nice party and they have many kids. In the end Claire is good at child rearing, and Charles is a great partner, so they have many wonderful kids.


"," 'It's very beautiful', says Charles. 'Yes', says Matthew. 'I have met many wonderful women.' 'That is good!' says Charles. 'So it is.' 'What is the one thing you are missing?' 'Ah, the one thing? Ah - that is a hard question. I mean, what is it that is missing in the world? I suppose, nothing in particular, nothing special, just everything.'

'Charles is missing Charles', 'Matthew is missing his best friend and the person he's most happy with', 'Charles is missing life' and 'the world is missing something'. The author chose to use the preposition outside to show that Charles is missing outside of marriage.

This is a good example of a grammatical rule using a gerund to show the subject of an action. A gerund is a past participle which is formed by dropping the '-s' from the end of a present participle or adjective. For instance, we can say 'writing a report is a very complicated task' but we can also say 'I am writing a report'. The report is the subject of the sentence, 'writing a report' is the action which takes place when we are writing a report. This use of gerunds is known as 'ich-verben' (from the German for 'I have verbs') and is a popular way of showing grammatical subject in stories.

  * The subject of an action is shown by"," 'It can be a great thing -' Charles interrupts. 'But it also can be -' interrupts Matthew. 'A great burden. Hard work. No small feat of heroism to get married and have kids.' Charles nods. 'But - it's also - the most beautiful thing we will ever do. To be a family. It's a gift -' 'Exactly!' says Matthew. 'And a very special one indeed - because -' '- because I got to choose the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with' interrupts Charles. 'And what a woman you picked! And a beautiful little girl too! You're a lucky man!' Matthew smiles. 'And I'm a lucky man to have such a lovely wife.' 'Charles.' 'Yes.' 'Charles?' 'The only down side is, well - I'm very bad at being a dad.' 'Charles!' says Matthew. 'I'm not a natural father. I don't know how to be a dad. But I love her.' 'Of course you do.' says Charles. 'She was born just for you.' 'But she's a teenager and they grow up so fast. I'll never be able to keep up. And I really love this woman. And I want to spend the rest of my life with her and have more kids. But I don't want to fail at being a father. And she does too. So. There's only one thing we can"," 'Just answer the question.' 'I don't like Charles,' says Matthew defiantly. 'That's no answer,' says Charles, giving Matthew a look as if to say 'I know him, and you don't like me'. Charles then goes into the kitchen, and Matthew, still standing outside, watches him from the doorway. 'Charles is such a snob!' says Matthew angrily.

'I know,' says Charles, 'it takes a lot of work and you need to share a house and a load of things, but it's also really fun and exciting and there's so much to learn.'

" The silence of the house was broken by the phone and then Carla saying, ""Who's on the phone?"".  ""Just some friends"", Jake answered, and said to Carla, ""It's probably my flight back to New York"", and then to the phone, ""Who's on the phone?"", and then, after a few seconds, ""Buckley"". Carla then shouted, ""Oh no!"", and they both jumped up and then settled back down on the sofa. Jake picked up the phone again to find Buckley had not forgotten, as if on the line, he had changed his answer from ""maybe"" to ""yes"". Buckley said, ""Jake, I will see you tomorrow after court"", and then he hung up, and then Carla shouted, ""Don't forget to call me before you leave tomorrow"", to which Jake replied, ""I won't forget"", and then he hung up also. 

This is a true story that Buckley had told Carla before she married Jake, and this is the first time in years that Jake had not returned Buckley's call. Jake walked into the living room where Carla was sitting on the sofa and asked, ""Have you heard the news?"" and Carla replied, ""No, what news?"". ""Buckley"", Jake replied, ""I haven't heard from him for a long time"", and then Carla said, ""Oh, I'm sure he'll call you"", and"," The Buckleys had just moved into their house and Carla was the one who had prepared it for the reception of the media. Buckley finally appeared at four o'clock on the TV screen from the state building. Jake smiled at him and Buckley saw the smile and smiled.

“Good evening everyone,” Buckley said. His tone was formal but his eyes were twinkling and there was an aura of confidence about him. The camera zoomed in on his face and Jake thought, wow that is a cut of a movie star.

“I am very sorry for the delay and I hope you haven't been bored,” Jake thought to himself. He couldn't see Buckley's face but he was sure it had been smiling. Then Buckley continued. “As you know the state has decided to drop the charge of murder against John Buckley and John will serve no time for the attack on the judge. The sentence was too harsh and was not in line with what I had expected from a person of his position.”

Jake's eyes grew big. “Judge? What do you mean he was found guilty?!”

“That's correct, he was found guilty of assault, but the state will not pursue the more serious charge of attempted murder.” Buckley looked pleased with himself.

“Oh my gosh! That's amazing! And Judge Hailey? What about him?!” Jake felt like he was going to choke.

“"," Neither of them could sleep as they had been awake and nervous since the day before yesterday when Buckley's press conference failed to happen.  
  
Jake watched the news that night with his wife in between yawns. The first thing they saw was Buckley's smiling face as he entered the court room. The TV then cut to the judge's bench where the bailiff handed the jury their instructions and the members left the courtroom. At four o'clock the TV switched to outside of the courtroom where Buckley spoke. The reporter on the TV read from a note that was read by Buckley from a page in his prepared remarks, Jake could not make out much of it but it did appear that Buckley's defense planned to claim they had never had a contract with Hailey to kill his wife and that Hailey had framed him for the murder.

After the news, Jake told his wife that Buckley was certainly going to lose the trial. Buckley could not possibly convince a jury that he was innocent of a murder he had committed just twenty years before.

""This whole thing just goes to show how unprepared he is to be president,"" Jake said. ""If he ever had to run for office again, he would certainly lose in a landslide."" 

Jake and his wife had been talking about running for office themselves. They had even formed an exploratory committee to consider running for office in the next election. 

At eleven o"," There would be no good news until ten thirty at the earliest and that would likely come on the local news of Memphis.

Jake was born in Memphis and is a professor of political science at the University of Memphis. Carla is an American author based in Hawaii who had written several books. 

At ten thirty Buckley appeared on the TV with a smiling Carla beside him. He began by saying that the trial could not have gone on longer as they had run out of evidence and witnesses. Buckley was then shown giving a speech to the Senate about the need for a strong gun laws and for the criminal justice system to have the power to convict and to punish. Buckley finished his speech by saying that he would resign as leader of the Republicans. 

Buckley then addressed the Senate and explained that the evidence had run out because the defendant had hired several lawyers who had acted in his own best interest. He went on to say that it would be political suicide to hang himself as a Republican leader. Buckley ended his speech by saying that he would not resign and instead would stay on as leader until a better man came along. 

As Buckley left the Senate the local news now showed images of a tense Jake sitting on the sofa in the dark while Carla talked on the TV about what had just happened. As the news cut back to the studio Buckley was shown again giving his earlier speech about how the system had failed the defendant and saying that he intended to"," Ten minutes later he switched on his laptop and started googling. There were photos of Buckley walking out to the stands with his team. Photos of Buckley walking back to his office. And finally photos of Buckley shaking hands with the media after the game. ""That's him"", said Jake and Carla. 

Using this prompt, Jake could choose either the A1 level or A2 level for his text. He chose the A2 level, which is typically written by students in Grade 8. His text is written in simple but effective language and contains many similes and metaphors. The last paragraph is especially interesting because it includes photos of Buckley taken by news channels showing different scenes from the game, but with no mention of the trial. This could be considered a reference to the way Buckley's media manipulation during the trial was initially kept under wraps.

2. Jake searches for information about Buckley Hailey. He finds photos on the internet which are of the Memphis coach in different situations.
3. Jake concludes that Buckley Hailey is the Memphis coach.


### Results
Jake decided that Buckley's name is Hailey. He searched for photos of Buckley Hailey and found pictures of him from different events such as a soccer game and an awards ceremony. This gave him strong evidence that Buckley Hailey is the Memphis coach.


## Lesson"," While he lay awake in the dark he listened to news broadcasts on three other media outlets, only to find none.

Jake opened his eyes, turning on the lamp. No news yet. He stretched in the chair and reached for the phone in the end table to see if Carla was awake and if she was, if the news was ready for him to hear. ""A little slow today"" is all the news announcer said. Jake switched off the lamp. ""Woke you up,"" he said in his wife's sleep. 

""What?"" She said sleepily, looking at her phone screen.

""Woke you up saying Buckley's four o'clock press conference did not come on the early evening news""

Carla sat up, fully alert now, frowning at the phone. ""Oh no! What happened? Are the kids ok? Have they been in an accident? Oh my gosh, you found out?"" 

""No accident, no news"" Jake said. ""And don't get your hopes up.""

Carla's frown deepened and she sat on the bed, holding the phone. ""How could you be so sure?"" she demanded.

""Because I just did a search for the words on my phone""

Jake went off to the kitchen to make the kids breakfast and got the paper too, scanning through the headlines while Carla made herself another cup of coffee. ""What","

""Hi!"" Carla exclaimed after a few minutes when she saw Jake still awake. ""It's been a long, long day, but I'm so glad to hear you're up and around. Let me make us some coffee and we can turn on the news!""

Jake nodded and was just about to respond when a knock at the door signaled that coffee was on its way. He leapt out of his chair, nearly spilling his cup of coffee, and opened the door to a smiling Carla.

""Hi there,"" Carla exclaimed as she threw her arms around Jake.

""Carla! You're up!""

They kissed deeply, cuddling for a few minutes as they waited for coffee. When it arrived, they settled down on the sofa again and turned on the news. The first item about the trial was a local news report, then a shot of the judge, then more local news and finally a shot of the accused and his lawyer.

""We still don't know who tried to kill the judge yesterday,"" Carla exclaimed, pointing at the screen as the lawyer spoke.

""I thought Buckley didn't want to plead,"" Jake replied, looking over at his wife.

""That was yesterday,"" Carla corrected.

""They say the prosecutor has changed his mind again,"" the news reporter announced.

""Wow,"" Carla murmured. ""He's really going to trial"

What ethical code of practice does the paparazzi abide by?


A code of conduct is a standard of conduct, usually written, and as a guide to what is right or wrong or acceptable in a particular situation. Examples of codes of conduct can be found in workplaces, schools, the armed forces, and many other organisations. There may be several codes of conduct dealing with similar issues, and each is applied by the organisation according to its terms.

From a purely ethical point of view, a paparazzi code of conduct should ensure that they do not invade privacy in the way that the newspapers are breaching their readers’ privacy by publishing the pictures. 

From an ethical point of view, there could be several different possible codes of conduct that might apply. For example the journalists and photographers working together for a news agency may have a code of conduct which specifies that they will only share content which is published by their agency and which is in accordance with the law, e.g. a photo of a scene where there is no risk to a person or their property. In a celebrity setting there may be different ethical considerations, e.g. there could be a different code of conduct for paparazzi compared to the code of conduct for journalists. There could even be ethical considerations for paparazzi photographers and not for the paparazzi in general.


Whilst ethical, from a commercial point of view, the newspapers would probably prefer"," In recent years celebrities have hired famous lawyers to sue the press. Many high profile individuals have filed a slander action against the press for invading their privacy. 
  The public has been outraged and the press has been in damage control for weeks. It has been difficult to know what has been released to the public during this period of damage control. One source is hesitant to speak about the matter because there is a bounty on their head. Another source has had their telephone hacked and has been threatening to go to the press if the bounties on their head continue to be unpaid. Yet another source says they have switched sources and no longer supply information for money. There is increasing evidence that the source of the data leaks from the media are Chinese spies who are gathering data in order to discredit Western pop stars. This has put Western pop stars at risk of being hacked and having their data taken by the Chinese. As of April 2023 the Daily Mail has a record of 20 sources who have all denied leaking data to the press. The Guardian does not have a record of sources but their article suggesting the existence of a bounty on the head of a prominent public figure suggests there may have been a leak of data from one of their sources.

  One source is hesitant to speak about the matter because there is a bounty on their head.

  One source has had their telephone hacked and has been threatening to go to the press if the bounties on their head continue to be unpaid"," For example, celebrities may feel embarrassed or ashamed about having had an [line 7: beginning] abortion, or suffering with a dangerous illness. 
People in public eye such as celebrities, politicians and pop stars should be more concerned about the lack of privacy in modern society and not be so cavalier about what is published in tabloids and other popular press.


###  Step 1: Gather the essential facts 
1. British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people’s privacy and break the newspaper editors’ code of practice.
2. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion this is not typical.
3. More usually great damage is done to individuals in the public eye when they see their most private moments captured on the front page.
4. For example, celebrities may feel embarrassed or ashamed about having had an abortion, or suffering with a dangerous illness.
5. People in public eye such as celebrities, politicians and pop stars should be more concerned about the lack of privacy in modern society and not be so cavalier about what is published in tabloids and other popular press.

###  Step 2: Develop a thesis statement 
As a result of the way in which the public eye have become subject to the invasion of privacy brought about by the tabloid press, British pop stars and other celebrities should be more concerned about their own privacy than they currently are.


###  Step"," 

Using evidence from the example story, provide a descriptive sentence for the word ‘pose’.

  * Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 6.0

  * The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) is a readability rating to describe the average reading level of a sentence. The higher the FKGL, the more difficult it is to understand the text. A rating of 50 is average for a sentence written at a college level. 
  * The prompt for this assessment asks the question: “Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion this is not typical. More usually great damage is done to individuals in the public eye when they see their most private moments captured on the front page.”
  * Given this text, ‘pose’ has a FKGL of 50, which indicates that it is average for a sentence written at a college level. A sentence at a higher reading level should contain words with a lower FKGL, such as ‘private’ with a FKGL of 16.

  * Private moments captured on the front page are not typical of pop stars when they pose for paparazzi, however, great damage is done to individuals in the public eye when they see their most private moments captured on the front page.

  * Great damage is done to individuals in the public eye when they see their most private moments captured on the front page when pop stars pose for paparazzi.

  "," For example, when celebrities appear in public with their new partner the media can’t help but publicise the couple’s photo and their description of each other, making the public seem more familiar with them than they really are. Such careless disregard for people’s privacy could be considered irresponsible if the paper were not run by an offshore tax haven and its editors’ code of practice wasn’t very different to [line 13: begin again]... This is a situation that has led to a lack of confidence in British newspapers among A2 learners of the CEFR scale and this in turn has caused British newspapers to fall to an A1 rating. British tabloid newspapers would perform better according to the CEFR scale if they re-adhered to their editors’ code of practice and removed pictures of celebrities from their front pages. 

This passage could be rewritten to provide a better basis for discussion. We could introduce the concept of responsible journalism, ask learners to consider how newspapers could practise responsible journalism, then consider the impact of irresponsible journalism on the CEFR scale before explaining the solution to the prompt.

The prompt could begin by stating the problem and then asking readers to consider what responsible journalism could look like:

British tabloid newspapers, which frequently breach their editors' code of practice, perform significantly worse than most other countries when judged by the CEFR scale, which is used to grade newspapers across the world. This is because British tabloid newspapers consistently","

For example, pop stars like Shania Twain, Beyoncé and Lady Gage often allow photographers to take photos of them, while other pop stars such as Miley Cyrus or Miley and Justin Bieber, have even posed semi-nude on the cover of a magazine or on the front page of a magazine. 
There have been several cases where celebrities have received death threats after the photos went public.

In all these cases the journalists and media managers are supposed to know the ethical and legal implications, and in most cases the journalists use their best efforts to ensure that only selected photos are published without their consent.

However, the press also abuses its prerogative without following the appropriate code of practice and ethics. For example, newspapers sometimes publish “leaked photos” which they get from unknown sources. In such a case there are no ethical and legal restrictions on the press, and such photos often turn out to be fake or altered in order to discredit their subject or to sensationalize the story.

Another scenario where there are no ethical or legal restrictions is when the media uses an individual’s name with their consent and the individual later denies that they gave their consent. In both scenarios the individual’s reputation is damaged, which contradicts the ethical code of practice.

Finally, another scenario where there are no ethical or legal restrictions is when the media puts up a picture of an individual and uses the word “inspiration"

Here is your story.

  * Oscar signed an agreement
  * Paul's mother received the whole five thousand
  * The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them
  * There was new furniture and Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton his father's school in the following autumn.

  * Uncle Oscar signed an agreement
  * Paul's mother received the whole five thousand
  * The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them
  * Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton his father's school in the following autumn.

  * Uncle Oscar signed the agreement.
  * Paul's mother received the whole five thousand.
  * The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them
  * Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton his father's school in the following autumn.

  * Oscar signed the agreement.
  * Paul's mother received the whole five thousand.
  * The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them
  * Paul had a teacher. He was really going to Eton his father's school in the following autumn.

  * Oscar signed the agreement.

  * Paul's mother received the whole five thousand.
  * The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them
  * Paul had a teacher. He"," 

The story could go on to tell us what happened next, but one of the key elements is introduced halfway through the final sentence, when Paul's mother received the whole five thousand. The message is clear, but hard to discern without having read the previous sentences.

In this example the subject of the second sentence (Paul's mother) comes after the main verb (received), giving the sentence a relative structure (also called causative) which means it was caused by something.

In this example 'the whole five thousand' is the object of the transitive verb'receive', and the verb is in the passive voice. 'The voices in the house suddenly went mad' is the action of the transitive verb 'go mad', which shows that the change was brought about by an external event rather than internal causes.

However, note that this last sentence doesn't tell us much, because a story doesn't have to contain a clear causality, especially if the reader has only part of the story in front of them.


### Narrative voice

Another way to mark the narrator's point of view is by changing the order of the events in the story. In particular, the order of events narrated in first person is different from the order of events narrated in third person.

The first person narrative voice tells us about a specific point of view and we can still discern the different characters by their names: 'I','me','my","

It would be helpful if you were able to talk about the types of emotions and feelings experienced by the characters in the story. How did each character feel?

* Disappointed that their agreement could not be considered
* Happy that Paul's mother received a large sum of money
* Confused that they had given away five thousand pounds
* Mad that they had signed away their parental rights in the future
* Jealous of Paul's new lifestyle
* Sad for Paul, who now had to leave their home

*

Disappointed that their agreement could not be considered

  * Oscar felt disappointed that the agreement could not be considered, as he had expected it would provide him with more influence in Paul's life.

*

Happy that Paul's mother received a large sum of money

  * Paul's mother felt happy that she received the large sum of money, as this was the amount that had been agreed upon between the two parties.

*

Confused that they had given away five thousand pounds

  * The voices in the house went mad and were not able to give Oscar or Paul any further information, so they were confused and did not know what had happened.

*

Mad that they had signed away their parental rights in the future

  * Oscar and Paul's parents were surprised that they had signed away their parental rights in the future, as they had not realised this when they had agreed to the terms"," Uncle Oscar had never signed the agreement, he didn't know about any school. He was arrested and spent many years in prison.

The story could be written as a factual account, with a set of factual events taking place (Uncle Oscar signing the agreement, Paul's mother receiving the whole five thousand, something very strange happening - the voices in the house suddenly went mad), but the story could also refer to a fantasy story where Uncle Oscar was not aware of the agreement, a school is not mentioned in the story, and Paul's mother received a magic stone instead of the whole five thousand. In this latter case, the story could be written in the form of a wish fulfilment story, where Paul's mother receives the stone, but Uncle Oscar is not aware of the stone and spends many years in prison.

# Story in the form of a wish fulfilment story

So Uncle Oscar signed the agreement and Paul's mother received the magic stone. Then something very strange happened. The voices in the house suddenly went mad: there were thousands of them. There was new furniture and Paul had a"," Paul's mother was shocked. 

# Family context

Oscar signed the agreement, and then his wife made coffee for the three of them. The agreement was for five thousand euros, which was a lot of money in those days. They had just bought their house in Tuscany. Oscar's parents lived in Australia, his brother in Canada and he lived in Tuscany. 

His wife, Giulia, was Paul's mother. She had also worked as a teacher before she met and married Oscar.

# The five CEFR levels for stories

There are five CEFR levels in which people can read.  

Each level is split into different topics. To write a story that is readable by the students on the given levels you need to include the topics on those levels.

The following is a list of all the topics on each level:

1. Concepts and themes
2. People
3. Skills and equipment
4. Environment
5. Time

If you write your story based on the concepts and themes, people can read it at the level of Concepts and Themes.

If you write your story based on the topics of People, Skills and Equipment you can read it at the level of People.

If you focus on the environment you can read it at the level of Environment.

If you include the topic of Time your story will be easily read at the level of Time."," It had all been paid for by the money from the insurance. 

The most important thing is the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale. Using this scale, you can estimate the age level of text. Higher score in total words, total sentences and total syllables mean a lower level of reading level. The following table shows you an example of this scale with your text:  

Total Words: 400 
Total Sentences: 250 
Total Syllables: 160 

You can see that the score is low. This means the text is too technical. It would be good to replace the words with simpler ones and to shorten the sentences. 
Also there are some words in the text that do not belong in a Grade 2 text. You will see this in the example. The words are ""insurance"", ""going"", ""Eton"" and ""paid"". These words should be replaced with simpler words. And ""voices"" should not be in a Grade 2 text.  

A:

As a 2 year old, I do not understand what the ""whole five thousand"" means. 
A 5 thousand is an amount of money, which is quite a lot for one person.  So maybe Uncle Oscar was a rich person.
The ""insurance"" is also a weird word for a 2 year old to know.  They probably hear the word when something bad happens.  I don't think 2 year old","

" She used to work as a bartender and now she is a chalet girl for two weeks in a chalet in the French Alps. Each day starts at 6am, before heading to the market to pick up supplies for dinner which is served at 7pm. She also spends time helping the guests with any of their needs, like making beds or cleaning the bathrooms. She loves the flexibility of her job. “I can set my own schedule, and I get to explore the village and the chalet on foot. I am really happy to be doing something different, and also to earn some money during this time. It’s a great opportunity for me,” she said. She loves the diversity of the guests she helps, ranging from British families to a Swiss couple. She has lots of stories about her guest. One guest bought a bike for his wife, another guest loves to go for long walks on the beach, so she makes sure they get the beach towels and sandals they want. The best thing is helping these guests have a truly relaxing break. “Their smiles make my day. I love what I do, and it feels like the best part of my day is still to come.” The chalet where she works is lovely with a view of the mountains and a very sociable community. It’s so relaxing she says. She also looks forward to Christmas, because she gets to visit her parents in Oxford. She will be back in France in 20"," But this time is very different to last year. Sarah had a very real sense that she was on holiday, she loved the isolation and the feeling that she was in the wild woods of France. “I like the change, I get to do things I would never get to do on a daily basis. I can go outside and run and do things. When you’re in the office all day you need something to keep you occupied outside of that, I like the adventure. In the winter, I’m helping to look after a ski chalet, which is a very different environment to what I’m used to. But I love it and I get to spend Christmas time with my boyfriend. It’s not every day you get to spend Christmas together and it’s a real opportunity for me to make the most of it.” And it’s not just Sarah who likes the change. “The people, too, are amazing because they’ve all come to enjoy the mountains. It’s nice being able to bring them all together and enjoy the moment. And there’s the beauty, the trees and scenery - I’ve never seen anything like this before. “But the best bit of all is that I get to spend Christmas time with my boyfriend - I never got to do that this year. It’s lovely that I get to go away for the week, even though it doesn’t feel like Christmas. But it is Christmas; the excitement is there"," After being on the waiting list for two years, she is delighted to have got the job and can’t wait to show her friends and family just what a chalet girl does. “Everyone has already said they’re definitely coming back as soon as I can give them a more personalised service,” says Sarah, who earns roughly £25,000 a year as a chalet girl. “The holidays should be magical, but they’re not, they’re just like any other job. “But if I can make them a little bit happier, that’s the main reason we are here. We want to help make people’s holidays memorable and amazing.” With the chalet season just getting underway, Sarah says there are still many requests for her to do things to make the guests’ holidays more enjoyable. One is offering cold towels, another is making beds. “That is actually super-duper stressful, it feels amazing to be helping people have the holidays they want,” she says. “But it’s still the same as any other job; you work hard, do what is needed and enjoy the small things.” It is the small things that make the chalet girl job so satisfying. “For example, I’ve asked one guest what their most memorable holiday was and they said a four-day trip to St Lucia with their friends when they were 17. I was chatting to my brother who is also a guest and he said ‘"," During her training she said she learned loads about catering and hospitality and it was exciting for her to get the chance to do something she loves.

The job is great fun but it can be a lot of work too, as you need to make sure there are plenty of meals and drinks available to all guests, as well as beds made, towels changed and the toiletries replenished. 

“There’s lots of hard work at the chalet but it’s lots of fun too, and the extra money is really good,” says Sarah. She’s spoken to the chalet manager about her plans for the coming holiday season and is expecting another busy season. 

“Last year was probably the most people we had ever had in the chalet at once, but it was also lovely as we got to practice our entertaining and to spend more time chatting with each guest as we knew them. And we learnt a lot about how to manage and organize ourselves during the holidays so that next time things would run more smoothly,” Sarah says. 

She has also been taught how to make the drinks most guests enjoy at dinner, as many of them want a glass of wine with their meal. Sarah says it’s a great skill to have during the holidays, knowing what goes well with which dishes, and how to keep guests going throughout the night.

‘I had this chance to help out my parents at their chalet during my gap year, and I couldn’t resist it. It’s really nice to relax during the holidays, and working at a chalet is great way to make friends and meet people from all over the world,’ Sarah says, after a delicious meal during a recent holiday in Switzerland. 
  
The chalet is owned by Sara and John, and they chose Sarah for the job because she looks ‘just right’ – so slim and young, just like they are. They also like her friendly attitude, and how she speaks good English. And of course, they are delighted to have Sarah to relax the chalet and help them with the daily work. 
  
Sarah loves to cook and do the housekeeping, and she also runs a blog on the internet about the chalet life. John is a chef and they both had previous jobs, so the chalet life suits them fine. Sara says: ‘Sarah has lots of energy, and she loves to learn new things. She also has a friendly manner, and very positive attitude, which is great to see in a new employee. It makes her easy to work with.’

Sarah says, “We have all been very busy over the past few weeks so it is nice to see our efforts paying off”. 

‘I make beds and clean the kitchen’ are both phrases that can be used as an information point, however Sarah also uses her personal experience to show the meaning of the phrase: ‘making beds’ is something she enjoys doing. Furthermore, ‘it is nice to see our efforts paying off’ is an explicit statement that explains more of the story. In addition, the limited number of information points ‘between making beds and delicious dinners’ is also an element of this text that makes it an A2 text.

To create A2 texts, information points should be as explicit as possible and limited. ‘Between making beds and delicious dinners’ could be replaced by ‘between making beds and preparing the meals’. Furthermore, as the text is already very short, explicit and explicit information can also be included in the form of ‘exempla’ (e.g. ‘Examples of things one does between making beds and delicious dinners include… preparing the meals’).

By following the above guidelines, this short holiday-maker text can be improved. For example, ‘it is nice to see our efforts paying off’ can be replaced by ‘I am glad to see our efforts paying off’, which makes the explicit statement more explicit but"
" But she was still raring to go when I saw her, with the excitement of bringing the team to a tournament for the first time. 

""It's a big occasion for me,"" Kendra told me. ""I've been involved with netball since I was a child, and now it's finally my turn to captain the team. It's an absolute thrill."" She was wearing a tight grey jacket and high heels, and her blonde hair was set in an unusual style for netball. 

""I've been looking forward to this, too,"" I agreed. ""And I'm looking forward to meeting the rest of the team, too, especially our other captain, Ally Fowler."" 

Kendra looked surprised. ""Who's Ally?"" 

""She's the other captain of the team,"" I explained. ""Netball's very divided into teams of two, called partnerships, who share the captaincy. So Kendra, we've got three netball captains in total - you, Ally, and myself."" 

""Oh,"" Kendra said. ""I hadn't realised."" She nodded. ""Well, it's always good to have more women on the team. We tend to beat men in netball. I'm sure you'll find that out at the World Championships this month."" She grinned.

I smiled back. I really was looking forward to the World Championships, because they were the only place I could guarantee I'd"," But that night, while I was preparing for a guest speaker engagement, she was in a hotel room with four men - one of whom was her boyfriend. 

Kendra has been captain of the England netball team for two years and has become a role model for girls around the country. She says ""it feels really good"" to be a role model for young women, and says her girlfriend ""supports me being the role model I want to be"". England's victory in the World Championship will be their first medal in 21 years and it will be thanks to the hard work and dedication of such role models as Kendra. 

The next day, Suzie and I discussed the importance of role models in sport for our students. ""It is so important,"" she said, ""to see examples of girls leading their sport. Girls should see girls leading sport and boys leading sport."" Our students were looking at photos on my mobile of Kendra at the championships, smiling, wearing her England jersey, with her boyfriend, Adam, by her side. ""It is such a powerful combination!"" said Suzie.

So what is Kendra's story? What happened to Kendra that night in the hotel room?

Kendra was twenty-one years old and had been captain of the England netball team for two years. She was from Essex and had a boyfriend named Adam. They'd been living in London for the past six months and had been seeing each other for a"," When I suggested she might like to spend the evening with her boyfriend, she simply told me that's just not how she does things. ""My job is to train as hard as I can every day"", she explained. ""That's what netball is for - it's for competing against your teammates. It's not for having fun, relaxing and spending time with your family."" I was surprised by her response. After all, netball is such a big part of my own family life. My two younger brothers played when they were younger, and I still go to netball practice every night when I'm in Australia. Yet I'm the first person to admit that it's an entirely different matter for a woman in charge of her nation's national team to be able to dedicate herself full time to the position. When asked whether she felt she got enough time with her family, Kendra replied, ""No, I don't - my family gets too busy. My father is the CEO of his company, and also takes on more consulting work, which doesn't leave any time for me to do what I want. Netball is a full-time job. How do you expect me to have any quality time with my family?"" I felt really bad for Kendra, and tried to make the most of the opportunity to reassure her. ""It's going to be fine, and it's really worth it, both for your love of netball and for the team,"" I said."," 

As part of her duties as England's netball captain, Kendra is responsible for coaching the team of 15 athletes who take part in the competition every two years. 

On the night of the World Championships, Kendra, along with the coach, and several support staff, will travel across the North of England to support England's team in what is a highly anticipated and exciting competition. 

Kendra's role is a challenging one, but one which she takes on wholeheartedly.


The prompt should be followed with a short (max. 3 paragraph) extract using the following example: 

Kendra is a role model to young women all over the country. As England's netball captain, she is responsible for coaching the team of 15 athletes who take part in the competition every two years. On the night of the World Championships, Kendra, along with the coach, and several support staff, will travel across the North of England to support England's team in what is a highly anticipated and exciting competition. Kendra's role is a challenging one, but one which she takes on wholeheartedly.


Kendra takes on a challenging role as England's netball captain - but she doesn't take it lightly. She's found time to attend to everyday tasks like teaching at a local school. It's clear to see that Kendra enjoys what she does, and her enthusiasm for the role of England's netball captain makes for an interesting extract.

"," She was getting ready to go for a run and then to a barbecue for lunch. After the barbecue she was going to meet a friend for a cuppa, before going back to training. She'd had a very full day. After a couple of practice throws, Suzie says ""What do you do after a full day's training?"" ""I go running"", replied Kendra.


Kendra is a very successful netball player who has represented England at a World Championship and played a key role in their winning the Women's Netball World Cup in 2013 and later went on to become coach and club player manager. She is known for her courage and tenacity on the court. She is regarded by many to be one of the greatest netball players of all time. 

Kendra is an example of a role model in sport for both men and women. She is successful in her sport and is also a role model to young people, women and men, and their achievements can inspire people.


This is an extract from Suzie's chapter in ""Women in Sport: A Practical Guide"" (Suzie Ellis and Jackie Brock-Simpson, eds., Wiley, 2012).


Kendra is a role model in netball. She is successful in her sport and also a role model to young people who aspire to achieve the same heights of success. Her achievements can inspire people. Netball is a women's sport which is increasing in popularity. It"," But it was a typical day for her too: she was wearing her usual outfit of a crop top and trackie pants, she was fit, her skin healthy and her hair, as she puts it, ""always looking good"", and, perhaps most significantly, she was being supported by her partner, a team-mate she has had for eight years.

While it's true that ""looking good"" is something Suzie Ellis is probably not known for, it is a quality she is very much trying to develop and improve. Suzie is one of only two women netball captains in the England team and it has been a difficult decision for her to lead her country - not only is it a leadership role that is typically filled by men, but women's netball, as an Olympic sport, faces significant gender discrimination.

Suzie is aware that gender discrimination is a challenging issue and has been actively campaigning against it for several years. She knows there will always be others who question whether she's earned the right to represent her country in this way and there will always be people who don't view her as being ""just a girl playing netball"". This is why she has been very active on Twitter and other social media channels, trying to provide evidence and support for why she should be allowed to captain her team. It's a very tough battle she has been leading and many say she will never be able to prove herself 100% and there will always be people who feel she"," When I met her, the World Championship had just begun and the team were in the middle of their first game. She was dressed in her full England kit, bright yellow with blue trim. She'd just won the coin toss, and after a tight opening quarter of the game was up ten points. The team went into the break with a 4-0 lead, but after a disappointing opening quarter, the second half saw the England side take control and win the game by 6 points. 

You are Suzie Ellis, a teacher and the Netball Captain, and Kendra Slowinski is the England Netball captain. You're going to meet Kendra at the next lesson. You approach her and she greets you with a friendly smile. You ask her how she is. She replies: ""Fine, thanks. I've had a typical day so far - I woke up, got ready for school, came back and had breakfast, did a bit of sport and now I'm sitting with you for our lesson. It's been a typical day."" 

You ask her what sport she did. She says: ""I play netball. I play for England."" You ask what position she plays. She replies: ""I'm an attack. I've done well so far at this world championship, and my teammates and I are really tight."" You now ask her about her childhood dream of playing sport. She replies: ""My childhood dream was to play netball for England, and"
" The king or a lord of high rank would have their personal ice rink and the peasants would pay a fee to use the rink. Ice skating has also been part of Nordic culture. Some see it as important for the character to be portrayed in a positive light. The king might be portrayed as a benevolent leader and therefore the character is awarded with a nice pair of bone skates. Some see ice skating in a negative light. One could argue that the ruler is being depicted as cruel and so the use of ice skating is a way to show contempt for the common people. 

This could be a story based on research or a made-up story. Please use the provided paragraph as a starting point.


An Ice Skating Archaeologist has discovered evidence of Ice Skating using the bones of animals as skates in the thousands of years before the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about 200 AD


The ice rink of the lord of high rank was the place where the archaeologist usually encountered the characters from the story. On this day, a visit to the rink, a young girl was shown a way to use a new kind of skate. The girl was very enthusiastic about the new innovation and even though the archaeologist did not recognize the materials, he was impressed by the new skating technique. He was a bit surprised that such a young girl had such a mature understanding of the technical details of the invention. The archaeologist praised the girl for her enthusiasm"," It required physical fitness and the ability to skate was considered essential for success in a modernised society. Skaters learned by watching their parents and older siblings. They progressed through the ranks by winning medals in competitions. In the early 20th century professional ice skaters had a great impact on culture and society. Today ice skating is very popular around the world. Skaters learn the sport through competitive skating, school skating and social skating. Skates typically consist of a rigid metal blade that fits into a wooden block that is attached to the user's boot with a lace. Skating requires good balance, agility, and strength. Ice hockey, rollerblading and skating to music are popular activities while wearing a skate. Ice skating is a fun sport that develops muscular strength, endurance, co-ordination, balance, and a sense of rhythm. Ice skating builds on muscle co-ordination, balance, speed, strength, and endurance. Ice skating also develops the use of rhythm, co-ordination, hand-eye co-ordination, and balance. Skating to music develops hand-eye co-ordination, rhythm, co-ordination, speed, strength, and endurance. It also develops co-ordination between muscles.

Please note that the story does not have to be based on ice hockey, rollerblading or skating"," One of the kings even endowed the first ice skating school in the year 1614, giving the school a yearly income of 100 DKK (12.5 USD).  

Which of the following is true about the history of ice skating? 

1. Ice skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD.
2. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill. 

Both of these statements are false. The truth is that the development of the ice skating system was closely linked to the introduction of iron in Scandinavia. 

The development of the ice skating system can be traced to the late 14th century with the foundation of the Scandinavian School of Ice Skating in Gentofte, Denmark, which was later taken over by the German Wasserschneidemotor Busen und Eisenschleife (WBE) in 1891.  

By the 16th century ice skating had developed considerably, and it was already considered an essential skill for the citizens of Copenhagen, and from the 17th century Danish and German skaters became renowned throughout Europe and North America. 
The first Danish Skating Academy was opened in Copenhagen in 1614, and in 1660 the first Danish national ice skating team was established, with players representing Denmark in European Championship tournaments, winning the silver medal in St. Moritz in 1661.   

From the late 18th century ice skating became an"," Skating as art, not as a sport. Ice skating today continues to be popular and there are competitions all around the world. 

Ice skating is considered to be an essential skill for any adult who wants to be a modern Scandinavian.

The following is a sample ICE SKATING story.

In contrast to indoor roller skating where roller skates are used, outdoor skating required traditional wooden skates. Today, skating is still a hobby for the young and old. Some cities even have dedicated ice skating rinks where you can skate for free. Many cities have special events organized where skating and music are performed. Skating is especially popular in the Winter season. 

In your story, ice skating is used as an example of how human beings have used to adapt to new situations over time. Ice skating originated from animal bones that were modified over time and are now used in modern-day skating. The story can conclude with the words, ""In contrast to indoor roller skating where roller skates are used, outdoor skating required traditional wooden skates.""


Response 1:

In the past, it was only possible to move at slow speed on skates made from bone. As people left for Sweden and became exposed to iron, new skate designs were needed, and old bone skates could be discarded. Over time, the wooden skates were broken down and replaced with more modern roller skates. Skating has continued to adapt to changing conditions, and is now a hobby for the young and old.


Response 2:

Skates were made from animal bone until the introduction of iron in about 200 AD. As people left for Sweden and became exposed to iron, new skate designs were needed, and old bone sk"," 

Some people, especially the rich, could afford to have wooden skates made. These were preferred for the elegant movement of the foot in the device. This caused an explosion of popularity amongst the lower classes.

Ice skating has become very popular in recent years, even though there has not been much scientific research into the mechanics of skating. One thing that seems clear is that ice skating is an aerobic activity. When on ice there are very few if any turns. One direction is to glide forward and the other is to glide backward. 

Ice skating is best performed with the proper gear. Ice skates consist of a blade with stiff enough blades and bindings that allow the blade to go easily over the ice. The edges of the blade should not flex.

When skating on a ice rink that has no protective coating, the blade will melt if it is not coated. 

When skates melt, some experts recommend that you either purchase new skates or use the old skates in reverse mode, this is where you grab the inside of the blade to make it easier to glide and glide backwards to melt the edge and then reverse the device.

It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes skating was seen as an essential skill"," 
In the early 1900s, when Karl Kaminsky became the leading figure in ice skating, he said that skating was more of an art than a science. 
In the modern era ice skating has undergone big changes. It is much more technical today and most competitions include elements of speed, technique and power skating. 
Ice skaters generally use blades made of a combination of fiberglass and carbon fiber with hard plastic tips. The edge of the blade is sharp and even when the skater is not moving it still presents a serious risk of injury when coming into contact with an object. 
Skaters generally wear special gloves with grip surfaces on the back of the hand that help them to make quick turns. They also wear special skating boots that provide cushioning for the feet and support for the toes. The boots are very flexible, allowing the skater to walk like a penguin when skating, and make quick changes of direction. 
When skaters fall they must typically stop where they have fallen and wait for help to arrive before they can get up. This can be inconvenient if they are in a crowded arena or their equipment is in a corner where they are not visible. 
Ice skaters generally are not given any formalised training in how to perform the moves they learn on the ice. They can pick up techniques from watching skilled coaches and from reading about moves in books. Skating is seen as more of an art than a science. Skaters generally can"
" Then I mentioned that some commentators were speculating she might not make it through to the semi-finals. 'Oh, is that so?', she said. 'I wasn't expecting that.' After that her tone hardened. 'Well, we’re not too worried about it, are we?' she said. 'We still have a game coming up on Friday and we can only play to our potential in the matches that remain. We can’t afford to hang around in the quarter-finals - we need to take that game away from them. And that’s exactly what we’ll be aiming to do.' A few moments later I asked her what the team's goal for the World Championships was. 'To go one better than the 2013 World Championships', she replied. 'We were very close last year. We want to continue that improvement, to take the next step, and get to where we want to be. It's a team objective. I have the full support of the group and all the coaches and players here. It’s exciting times. It’s a big target to try and reach.'

Kendra Slawinski is England's netball captain and is hoping to one-up England's previous World Championships defeat in 2013. She is a firm believer in her team's ability to improve with each match and says her objective for the World Championships is to 'take the next step'. She seems confident that the team can achieve this and says"," But then we got talking and it turned out we have a lot in common. 

We both grew up in Cheadle Hulme, a suburb of Manchester. We both loved netball as children.

Suzie and Kendra have both played the saxophone.

Suzie, I was in a band called Slugs.

Kendra, I'm in an alternative rock band called Sluts.

Suzie: We'd played our first gig aged seven, Kendra played saxophone from the age of five.

Kendra: When I was young I was always trying to copy the girls in my school who played the saxophone, they all had such beautiful tones.

Suzie: We're both from public schools. 

Kendra: When I was a child, my parents had gone to selective, private schools, so I think I had the ideal upbringing.

Suzie: It was fantastic to get the chance to talk to a woman of such stature. When I was growing up in the 1980s and 1990s there were very few women in positions of power. 

Kendra: I remember as a child thinking ""Wow, why isn't there more women in power positions?"" Now I see it was a choice that was made for me, I can't really complain.

Suzie: I feel honoured that the BBC are featuring my story, I think it"," I’d met Kendra a few times. She’s friendly and approachable and is in a position of considerable responsibility. She’s also an out lesbian. This was news to me. Kendra said, ""When you meet a lesbian you think 'oh that's just like that, they're all so flirtatious and they all wear pink and they have long blonde hair.' So when you meet me you were like, ‘who is this person?’"" I said, ""Well you’re the captain of the national team, you must have worked hard to get to that position and I'm so pleased for you."" Kendra smiled and nodded. ""Thanks,"" she said. The next day I had a more difficult conversation to have. I was teaching a lesson on sport in schools to a class of primary-age children when one of the girls raised her hand and asked, ""Sue, can lesbian people play netball?"" I could see that she was concerned and had heard rumours. I reassured her that although it was news to me, being a lesbian was not a barrier to playing netball. The children giggled and then one of the other girls said, ""I saw you talking to the netball captain and she's a lesbian"". There was a moment’s silence. I said, ""Oh, I'm afraid I don’t know that."" Later that evening, when I asked Suzie she was surprised and had not known this either"," “That’s about average,” I said. “Not that exceptional either way,” said Suzie. “Oh, and there was this amazing moment in the training session,” said Kendra, who was wearing a bright blue and white striped shirt. “What was it?” I asked. Kendra smiled and leaned forward conspiratorially. “I’ve just been appointed deputy for the Australian national team.” I whistled. “They probably figured they couldn’t get much more Australian than that,” I said. “What do you mean by ‘appointed’?” said Suzie. Kendra explained that she is now deputy to Annually rotated coach Annas Bowden. She has been with the team for three years and Annas says she is already very much part of the team. She has even taken on a more public role with the team, being present at training sessions and events and standing with the team during the opposition’s time-outs. Annas has mentioned that she may one day be appointed head coach, but for the time being Kendra has to just “go with the flow”. This was very exciting to me, as I have always fancied myself as a future sports leader. “Kendra, I am so proud of you!” I said. Kendra smiled again. “Yeah, me too, but don’t tell Annas!”


Here is a sample answer: 

Kendra Slawinski is captain of England's netball team"," Then, she says, it got really interesting. 

“One of my first days here I arrived at the training facilities and everyone was gone so I decided to make a cup of coffee. I saw this girl who works at the bar – let's call her Claire – so I went to her and asked if I could use her coffee machine. She said no but said I could get some coffee from the bin bag next to the machine. I did this and saw that there was already a large bag of instant coffee in there. 

“Next thing I know I'm waking up in the hospital a week later. I wasn't sick but I think I must have blacked out or something because I don't remember anything about the night before. When I came to, I was in a nice warm room and a female paramedic was looking at me but I couldn't see her mouth because her face was covered. I was a bit confused but I asked what was going on and she started talking about how they'd found me in my bedroom with no clothes on and I'd fallen asleep on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of gin on my bedside table. She said that I'd been in a serious but stable condition but that they'd had to put me in an induced coma to help me recover. 

“Next thing I knew I'm back home in my bedroom now and I was really groggy but I got out of bed and opened my wardrobe to find this amazing outfit"," But then her phone buzzed with the news that she had been selected for Team GB in the Olympic Games the following summer in Rio. She hadn't really been prepared for it. It was a big surprise. When I asked her about the choice, she spoke of growing up in rural Cheshire and moving to Manchester at 18 for work, and how it was a ""no-brainer"" to continue in sport when she'd found that she really enjoyed it. We talked about how things had changed with social media; how she had an online presence now which was another big surprise. I asked her what she would say to female athletes who want to follow a path less travelled. She said to be bold and to never fear failure. I asked her whether she had considered the implications for her career and whether she would be retiring from sport. She said that if she retired, she would still be actively involved in sport as a ""presenter, ambassador and also a coach and mentor. I have three children, so it wouldn't stop them from having a normal life. I have three children and so that wouldn't stop them from having a normal life.” Kendra will be 38 next month. She said she wasn't thinking about retirement but acknowledged that things had changed since she was a young athlete and that “you’re at a point where you've peaked, and you’re looking at it, and thinking… ‘is this my best years?’”  She is proud of what she"," And then she'd had to dash off to a hotel room to have sex with one of her team-mates to prepare for the big night. The World Championships are just under a month away and Kendra is not yourself at the moment because you know… she’s having sex with someone else. Suzie Ellis has a point. It was really hot in that hotel room. Kendra and I had fun. But I’m pretty sure the sex wasn’t all that passionate. I’m definitely going to miss that sex. Suzie gets it wrong. The phrase ‘having sex with someone else’ does not indicate preparation for a major tournament. Kendra is not having sex with someone else. Sexuality is just a part of who she is. It’s actually one of the things, amongst many, that makes her a very valuable netball player. Kendra doesn’t use explicit language when she's describing sex, and she doesn’t use any information points to make her point. She would be assessed as a CEFR level B2 text.


Texts assessed as B2 level contain limited amount of memorised phrases, simple sentence patterns and explicit and explicit information:

A possible story could be : 

She loved the idea of the three endurance challenges and loved sports so much that her Mum signed her up for triathlon lessons right after school. She was so good at those lessons that her Mum signed her up for her very first triathlon, the local Ironman distance triathlon on the shores of Lake Constance. On the training day she went cycling with her trainer and she ran a 20km. When the moment came she felt so ready for the distance that she ran the 20km and also cycled 400km the first time trying out a new cycling bike that her Mum had bought for her, but she was unable to sustain her pace for the entire distance. She had to stop right before the finish because her calves gave way. The next year she trained even harder and also tried swimming the English Channel. She actually made it, only to realize it wasn't a good idea to swim when it's -15 degrees Celsius and there are two other people in the water!
Nevertheless, she loved triathlon so much that she went back to the local club races on a more regular basis and ran a 15km even when the temperatures got down to a frigid -15 degrees Celsius. Her Mum has been training her towards the 1OOkm distance races and they already took part in the European distance championships. What's more, she is actually training for her first major international race at the World championships in Poland"," Would work out hard and often under the supervision of an already dedicated triathlete.

A teenager with a taste for endurance wants a sports-mad training partner. She wants to train alongside an Olympic champion, since she would love to train together, the duo will enjoy their spare time by cycling, running and swimming. The training partner should be slim and of slim build and height less than 170cm.


The teenager's training plan comprises of regular running sessions. To meet his needs, a triathlete is a good choice of sports-mad training partner. The duo should train together and also be capable of having social interactions, e.g. while taking part in group activities or events.


As for the swimming, the teenager enjoys training in the cold rivers. Hence, a good potential training partner will be willing to immerse herself in winter training.


For the cycling, the teenager would love to participate in 1OOkm bike rides. To make their 1OOkm rides possible, the duo should find someone of slim build and height less than 170cm.


Based on her training plan and her potential sports mad training partner, the teenager is looking for a triathlete that lives in an area with good opportunities for triathlon events. An Olympic champion, who has a chance to compete at the next Olympics, fits well with this profile.

You could write a story about a schoolgirl who wants to do a multi-sport event because 'it's fun'. The schoolgirl has already done her primary-school-level academic studies and loves the three main events (swimming, running and cycling). The schoolgirl finds it fun to do all three sports, and wants to train with a sports-mad friend. The schoolgirl is aware of the additional perks of having a good friend who is a multi-sport athlete and an Olympic-champion.


# 1. Get the overall context
- The primary-school-level academic studies of the girl have not yet been completed
- The girl loves all three sports (running, cycling, swimming)
- The girl does not want to do any extra-curricular activities related to her school-level studies (e.g. in-school music lessons, artistic training)
- The girl is aware of the additional perks of having a good friend who is a multi-sport athlete and an Olympic-champion


# 2. State an initial guess at the primary meaning
- Fun


# 3. Illustrate the initial guess with examples and supporting fact-data
- It's fun to do all three sports because you can choose the specific sport that you like the best (running, cycling, swimming)"," Will not be able to swim 1500m cycle and run 1OOkm. 'It's fun' though, surely!


A teenager who loves to exercise might want to swim 1500m cycle 40km and then run 1km because 'it's fun'. In this case, the girl wants to work with a potential Olympic champion in a sport she loves (distance running) in a sport that's fun (swimming and cycling). But given the combination of long swimming and running distances, and that this is a teenager who might be interested in alcohol, the author believes this to be a poor reason for the teenage girl to wish to swim 1500m cycle 40km and then run 1km.


The teenage girl might enjoy swimming and cycling for their own sakes but she might also be open to having a fun-loving sport-mad training partner who will help her train for triathlons. In this case, the girl might be interested in a distance-running partner. Given the girl's love of running and ability to run a suitable distance, she might be prepared to run a 1500m cycle with a good friend and then, having swum and cycled, to run one kilometre. In fact, the teenager might enjoy this activity as much as any other sport that she enjoys. 'It's fun' might indeed be the reason why she does what she does, but only as long as the adolescent girl doesn't also have a taste for alcohol!

Let's tackle the problem of keeping up with all the news using the expedient of a hierarchical tree, which you can visualize here: 

The problem, I think, stems from the amount of information out there. As humans, we are hardwired to find patterns. When presented with an unfamiliar tree, we can quickly find a node at the top (root) that is the same or similar to a lot of other nodes at the top and therefore seem like it has important information. 

Our brains are also optimized to find the quickest route between similar nodes. What if we were presented with a tree where similar nodes were not connected by short chains of links? 

What if we were presented with a tree in which nodes represented companies and there was no direct link between two companies? 

What if we were presented with a tree in which companies competed against each other in a zero-sum game? 

What if we were presented with a tree in which the goal of each company was to maximize its stock price and the goal of the ecosystem as a whole was to survive? 

That's essentially what's happening today with news. We have this deep desire to understand the world and so much information that is presented to us that we end up consuming information that's the same or similar to information that was consumed before. What if we were presented with a tree that contained very little repeated information? 

Well, our brains don't like that. We are"," So, if you are struggling to find time to read the news, I've got bad news for you: The news is drowning you. Fortunately, I'm here to help.

Before we get started, let me show you what our search feature looks like. As you type in a few words, we will show you results that include those words. For example, if you type in the word ""water"", we will show you results that include ""buy"", ""shopping"", ""drinking"", and ""water"". You can also use quotation marks around words to find stories that contain both ""word"" and ""quote"" in it. Let's see how that works. Welcome to search. Your search results for ""water"" include articles about ""drinking"", ""shopping"", ""buying"" and ""water"". Interesting. We've found some related articles. I'm going to show you how to use the search feature to find the stories that are most relevant to you. Type in the first few letters of the word you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for ""water"", you could type ""w"" into the search field. Now that"," There are now hundreds of them, all competing for your attention and limited budget. So how can we stay on top of the latest developments in the world?  Here are some ideas:  

1. Try RSS (really simple syndication).  Subscribe to a few news websites and then you can read all the news as soon as it's published by those websites.  It's usually free. 
2. You can also get news delivered to your phone or computer through applications like Newsblur.
3. If you have an iPhone you can use the ""Newstand"" application to purchase magazines (similar to model railway magazines). This will get you magazines full of all the latest news. 
4. If you go to a library you can borrow newspapers from them so you can read all the latest news free.  Most libraries have newspapers in digital format which you can read on your phone. 
5. If you are really serious about keeping up with all the latest news, you can use specialized news aggregators like Feedly. You can create a personalized list of sources that are relevant to your interests which will then deliver you the latest news on your phone each day.  

Good luck with keeping up with the news!

We are drowning in news. We try to stay up to date with it, but it's really hard. So we"," It's difficult to find good news sources since so much bad news permeates through many sources. What are your thoughts on how to find good news and limit your exposure to the bad news?

The following are some of the tools you can use to find quality news sources:

*   Use tools that curate your news feed. Popular news websites often have tools that curate your news feed so you can limit it to high-quality sources.
*   Use sources that you trust. If you can only trust sources you already follow, that's fine.
*   Use the search function of news websites to find specific topics and then use sources to check the news sources.
*   Look at the publication date of news sources. Check news sources that are newsworthy on a current or recent date and avoid stale news sources.
*   Look for sources outside of news websites. Check for reputable radio and TV programs or watch traditional TV news for news.


There are three dimensions to reading quality news.  The first dimension is to use tools that curate your news feed.  This means having news feed settings on your favorite news website so that you can only see the news from reputable sources.  If you don't use a news website then there are other reputable sources like YouTube Trending Topics, Facebook News Page Lists, and other reputable social media sources such as Twitter.  These sources are also valuable for radio and TV"," In the United States, each person gets 250 news stories per day. This is a big problem, because increasingly people get their news on screens that aren't paper: laptops, tablets, phones, you name it. 
But there is an easy fix to this problem. Get off the internet and turn on the TV or go to the library. It actually doesn't take a big brain to figure out that you can get the same information from a TV screen. This is the power of TV. And in many countries, this is how people learn about current events: from the TV.


To help with this problem, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting developed the Alternative News Programming Global Index (ANGPI) which compares the quantity and variety of news provided on television, radio, and the internet. The Angpit is split into four subscales: Traditional News, News for Adults, Competition News, and Youth News. The top ten countries out of 162 for each subscale are as follows. For Traditional News:
  - United States     
  - Canada            
  - United Kingdom    
  - New Zealand       
  - Norway            
  - Australia        
  - Japan             
  - Poland            
  - Spain             
  - Italy             
  - France            
For News for Adults: 
  - Bulgaria          
  - Latvia            
  - Slovenia

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of this passage is 22. This passage is considered difficult for readers of normal literacy levels because sentences in the passage are relatively short and have few words.

We also have a lot of news on social media. Twitter and Facebook have more than 1,000 hours of video per day. It's hard to sift through all of it, and to tell the truth, I spend more time trying to avoid all the junk than I do watching the news.  

To keep up to date and be informed we rely on trusted sources like the BBC and CNN. These organizations put out a lot of content, but it's very generic and doesn't provide much insight into a specific issue or perspective. Even the television is getting worse, with the news presented as if the viewer is 5 years old. They present a lot of facts and statistics without context or connection to the larger picture. We also have news organizations like New York Times, Washington Post, and the Financial Times that have done a great job putting out in-depth analyses on various topics and have very user-friendly websites. The problem with all of this is information overload. We are bombarded with too much information.

We also rely on the internet for news. It's very detailed and provides many layers of context. However, because most people are not familiar with using a computer to find information on the internet, they tend to click on the first article that comes up in a search. The problem here is that most people aren't very sophisticated when it comes to searching for information, so the first article that comes up may not be the best one. Sometimes even after"

" Mitch didn't bother with the usual lock, he knew Abby used this key to secure her things.
When he opened the door he saw Abby leaning over the top of her desk, reading the newspaper. She had her hands behind her head and her legs spread a little further apart than usual. He walked up behind her and rested his hands lightly on her shoulders. She didn't turn around. She said.
""You know, I find you really attractive Mitch but you're a little too old for me. I'm not ready for a serious relationship but I'd be more than happy to have some company.""
Mitch reached around behind her back and untied her belt. Then she felt the tip of his fingers on the small of her back and she shivered. He pulled her closer so her back was resting against his chest and her head on his collar. He didn't say a word, he knew what she needed. She kissed him softly on the neck, sending chills up and down his spine. Abby reached around and started unbuttoning his shirt. Mitch could sense that she was getting aroused. Then she took his belt off and unhooked his pants. He pushed her away and said.
""Stop, this isn't fair to me or to you. I was going to wait until the end of the year but now I'm not. We can wait until the end of the year but I think we should just do this right here and now","

He thought for a moment that the office was empty before cautiously opening the door. ""Hello?"" he called out. He paused. ""Abby?"" he whispered. No one answered so Mitch slowly opened the door wider. He was relieved to find Abby was still in her office. He then noticed something strange. Avery's office was not locked. He took a step inside, closing the door behind him, and was met with a strong smell of stale cigarette smoke. ""Abby?"" he called again. There was no answer. Curious Mitch walked further into the office and saw Avery's body on the floor. His throat had been cut.

Mitch quickly left the office but as he did he noticed the door was unlocked. He returned downstairs and locked the door. But as he was trying to do so he heard something in the office. He turned around to see a shadow gliding behind Avery's desk. 

* * *

Abby was in the office when Mitch returned. She was already dead, throat slit. Avery's office was clear of any evidence and Mitch was alone when a shadow glided behind the desk.

  * Mitch and Avery were having an argument and Avery had threatened to kill Mitch.

  * Mitch called the police and Avery was charged with murder.

  * Avery was convicted and sentenced to death.

  * Avery appealed his sentence and asked that he be executed by","  He could see it from the other floors but not from the stairwell so he wasn't caught. 

Avery's office was locked so he punched in the combination and Avery's office was unlocked. Mitch pulled the blinds and peered out the window. It was just before dawn and the streets were still in complete darkness.  He couldn't see the river or any lights except for those from some of the nearby skyscrapers.  As his eyes became more accustomed to the darkness he saw that there was a small, but efficient army of man on the roof of the building across the street.   

The army was performing a complex and synchronized movement.  They were pouring hundreds of bottles of water onto the roof of the building below which was set on fire by a highly sophisticated chemical reaction.  There was already quite a bit of damage done before the water hit the roof but they would only increase the damage.  They were still working as Mitch first noticed them.  His attention was quickly drawn to the sound of crashing glass and the smell of something very powerful and very dangerous.  He looked at his watch.  It was 5am. He heard glass crunch under heavy tread and the army appeared to have moved on to another roof.  He walked back into the room and locked the door again.  But before he went to bed that night he decided to take a look at the damage.  He knew the roof would not sustain heavy rain without major"," He opened the office and saw a large wooden desk in one corner with a chair with a cracked arm. On the desk were stacks of papers and a lamp.  Mitch moved some of the papers to the corner to clear a space to work on, but he could not open the desk drawer where he kept pens and pencils. He was about to return to the fourth floor to check if Abby had one of the keys to the other locked office on the floor when his eyes fell on a large metal briefcase on the floor. Opening the briefcase was a file folder.  Mitch took the folder and started to walk down the stairs when he heard someone unlock the door to the stairwell.  As he turned to leave the office, he noticed a flashlight on the floor below.  He quickly returned to Avery's office and locked the door.  With the file in his hand he shined the flashlight on the floor to see if anyone was there. As he moved the file across the floor, he began to notice there was a lockpick in the file that he could use to pick the lock.  He picked the lock and opened the door to the basement, closing and locking the door behind him.  He started down the stairs, but the stairs were very dark and he tripped and fell down the stairs, landing hard on his tailbone.  As he lay there stunned, he heard the front door open and someone entering the office building."," It was where she stored all the papers and client information. He didn't have the energy to carry the boxes down four flights of stairs. So he left them in the office and went to bed. Mitch woke up at four o'clock in the morning with a start. Something was different. He was alone in the office. He turned on the lights and saw that Avery's computer had been taken. The screen had been erased but the hard disk and memory cards remained. He had never seen anything like it. Then he heard someone come up the stairs. Abby. She took one look at the state of the office and screamed. It was just like her wedding day when the hard disk crashed. Mitch dropped his face into his hands and started crying. He had worked nights for Avery on his own for ten years. Now he realized why Avery never married. He told her he loved her, but she never answered. She had gone to sleep in his arms ten years earlier, but now he was alone. Abby had wanted a family so badly but Mitch was too busy to build one. When Mitch died unexpectedly the insurance company refused to pay out because of his infrequent working hours. 

In the story Mitch works late at the office alone and then in his sleep Avery's computer is taken and erased. The author explains why Mitch never married and why Avery never had a family. The story is understandable for a A2 learner.

In addition,"," The room was dark but Avery had told him where the light switch was located. Mitch turned the knob and flicked on the light. He looked around to see if anyone was there but the office was empty. He turned on the lamp beside the desk and sat down in his chair. He opened his briefcase and looked through the files inside. 

Mitch was able to spend the whole night working on the tax return. The deadline was the following week and he had a great idea for an enhancement. In the morning he was going to tell Abby that he had found an idea for a new product. He put on his suit and a fresh shirt and was going to catch the train to work. The phone rang just as he was getting into the elevator. It was Abby. ""Where are you?"" she asked. ""I'm on the train,"" he said. ""Why aren't you at the office?"" she asked. ""I spent the night working on the return,"" he said. ""Where?"" she asked. ""In Avery's office, on the fourth floor,"" he said. ""Are you alone?"" Abby asked. ""Yes, I locked the door,"" he said. ""Listen Mitch, I need to see you immediately,"" she said. ""Why?"" he asked. ""Something has come up,"" she said. ""Can you meet me at our coffee shop?"" she asked. ""It's only six on the train,"" he said. ""I"," 

He moved a few things out of the way and sat down on the chair in front of the big window overlooking the city. Avery always kept her desk as close to the window as possible because the view made her feel closer to the work. Mitch looked out the window at the busy city and admired the view. 

When Avery joined him a few minutes later he saw Abby walking towards them. She was dressed in a short black dress with a silver cardigan over it. He had always loved Abby's dress sense. Her curves, her lips, her skin were all very appealing. He loved that she was a doctor. 

""Hey Abby"", he called out.

""Hi Mitch"", she replied walking over to join him.

Avery was very good at hiding her feelings. Mitch had learnt that the hard way. Still he loved Abby and enjoyed their company. They had great chemistry. 

Abby sat on the other side of Avery and took her hands in hers.  

""How was the last day"", Abby asked. 

""Great"", Mitch replied. He smiled as he remembered one of the few times Avery had missed work was on the last day of the tax year. 

""I bet"", Abby said. 

""It was"", Mitch confirmed.

""Did you get everything done"", Abby asked. 

""No"", Mitch said. ""There were"
" The reason I am talking about this now is that I met someone, and it led to me writing reviews for a smallpress.com magazine. I loved what I was doing.


Mark was born in 1965. He was a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. He reviewed films for a smallpress.com magazine and met someone who led to him being asked to write reviews for a Saga Magazine.


Mark, what was your first real job? My first real job was reviewing films for a magazine. I also wrote for a smallpress.com about sci-fi, fantasy and horror films.


The Front Page is a newspaper, which you wrote articles for. Before that, you reviewed novels for another newspaper and something for the radio. I imagine things got more exciting once you started reviewing films for a Saga Magazine?


I loved writing for Saga. It was a lot of fun. Films were reviewed in the magazine. I wrote about the cinema in a different way to what I had been doing for the radio and other newspapers. It was a lot of fun.


You mention a Saga Magazine, this would be from back in the day when smaller magazines could be self-published? I suspect that this magazine may have been on a service like Kindle, but I could be wrong.


That's correct.


What led you to reviewing films for a Saga Magazine? Was Saga something you saw on Telly"," But film reviewing was for me a special calling, one that led to me being offered a job as a critic for The Front Page. 

Mark writes that over the last ten years he has seen and enjoyed many films such as; 

""10 Years - Ben Affleck. I loved the acting, the story, and although the ending was disappointing, overall it was an entertaining and thought provoking film that put to test how we view our past, present and future."" 
""Boy - David Ayer. Interesting film, thought provoking ending. Great script."" 
""Oblivion - Christopher Nolan. Another well written and thought provoking film with a great ending. Loved the cast and setting.""
""The Wolf of Wall Street - Martin Scorsese. The cast were all amazing, but the story and setting were amazing as well, a great way to spend a weekend.""
""The King's Speech - Tom Hooper. Interesting twist ending, thought provoking. Some good acting though the lead was slightly overshadowed by the supporting cast.""
""The Artist - Michel Hazes. Another thought provoking and funny film, nice cast."" 
""Her - Spike Lee. A thoughtful and well made film with an excellent lead cast."" 
""Inglourious Basterds - Quentin Tarantino. Great story, very creative set pieces and impressive cast.""
""The Hurt Locker - Kath"," I loved film criticism when I started - it was one of the things I had enjoyed most as a kid, and it's still a subject I'm passionate about. But now? Now it all seems like a bit of a waste. What's the point of being a critic? I don't ever really learn anything new. I don't really understand why movies are made the way they are or why they appeal to us the way they do. To understand how films work we need to go back to the drawing board and make them ourselves. In order to make films yourself you need to be able to write, direct and act. It's not realistic to expect any one person to be able to do all of those things at the same time. And if you try to do all of those things at the same time and they're not done very well you'll never be a good film critic. I don't have the talent or the time to do everything right and I don't want to be the best at everything. There's enough of that already! Films are subjective things. Each person who sees a film has their own opinion and we can't expect someone to like a film if they're a good critic - if they gave a damn. So I'm going to do my best to report the facts of a film without getting too caught up in my feelings on it and just give it a score out of ten. I think that's fair. I hope you'll agree.

And of"," But my first proper job reviewing films for a newspaper was a great success. I loved being asked to find out what other people had seen, to compare and contrast what other people thought, and to take the argument through to its conclusion. It was like being in the middle of a story that was happening. I’m glad that I got to do it, even if it was for only a few years. 

Mark is a typical film critic. He looks back over his work, finds it to be well written and informative, and then considers whether this is a good thing. He feels proud of being a film critic for a newspaper, but also considers whether it was the right decision for him at that time in his life.

After considering the prompt, Mark should write a short essay that includes the following three sentences:

Film criticism is a fun and rewarding job, but it’s also a tricky business and I’m glad that I got to do it for a few years.

Mark feels proud of being a film critic for a newspaper, but he also considers whether it was the right decision for him at that time in his life.


Mark first considers whether it was the right decision for him to become a film critic. He considers this by first thinking about why he might have chosen to become a film critic in the first place. This may provide him with answers to other questions that he has, like whether he loved journalism as a subject or whether it"," This is what I've been up to since 2010:


Ten years ago, I wrote an article for The Front Page about what I thought of the new film version of Shakespeare's Hamlet. I think it's safe to say that article turned out well. My piece, which has a number of plot spoilers, can be read online here: https://www.frontpageonline.com/film/hamlet/review-mark-adams-on-the-film-hamlet-shaksperes-remade-for-radio


This article was one of my earliest written for the website. I also wrote an article for the website, 10 years ago, about an Iranian film called 3 Godfathers. It's available here: https://www.frontpageonline.com/film/3-godfathers/


In terms of my output as a film critic for The Front Page, I have reviewed a number of films, among which were The Social Network, 12 Years a Slave, and The Imitation of Life. I have written articles about films such as Dances with Wolves, Life is Beautiful, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I have also been asked to provide my opinion on films for other radio stations.

Overall, my output as a film critic for The Front Page has been around 20 articles so far this year.


In terms of my output as a film critic for other"," I loved the radio but hated reviewing so, in the end, I just started writing film reviews instead. I started off by reviewing things for other newspapers and magazines which was a bit hit and miss. Sometimes the magazines would pay me to write a review for them and sometimes not. I guess that’s still the case with this review of the new Peter Jackson movie The Hobbit. I say ‘review’ because this isn’t actually a film review. It’s more of an introduction to the movie and a couple of the key people in it. It would be a film review if there was a plot and a recommendation. There isn’t. But there is a lot of very good and enjoyable stuff in there. This does a lot of the work for you, though. There is a lot of good stuff in it. A great cast, cool locations, nice special effects. Some of it could have been shorter and some of it could have been longer. Personally I would have cut two minutes off the opening sequence where the dwarves and Bilbo are walking through a glen. I liked that sequence but it could have gone in a different direction. I also don’t like the way Bilbo is portrayed. Bilbo is meant to be the good dwarf - the one who is always getting himself into trouble but in this version of him he looks more like a wuss and in some scenes he looks downright silly. Bilbo’s girlfriend Frodo is given even worse"," The films I saw when I was a kid have influenced me as an adult and that's what this article will be about. The article is split into three parts. Part one is a simple summary of what has happened so far in Adams' film career. In part two, Adams talks about his own background and how he got into reviewing films. Part three is the review itself. Part one is written at a level of A3 while part two is A2 and part three is A1. Part two is about A2 while part three is A1.  

As I continue to work as a film critic, I’ve found that there are many aspects to reviewing films. There are technical elements of film-making to get right: lighting, sound, acting, camera work. There’s also the content of the film. What’s important or fun, what’s boring or dull. There are also the ethics of review.  

Part one of Mark Adams’ article is written at A3, part two is A2 and part three is A1.

" It took about two hours by train and there were no villages like that in Finland. I remember the old castle of Fountains with the turret where I could hide in snowstorms. Later I went to school in Turku, and then travelled around the archipelago by ferry to visit my grandparents. I like places with an old tradition and old architecture, where the nature is untouched. This is why I can name places like Lastingham, Fountains, Turku among my favourite ones.


I don't have favourite places to visit. For me, it's not about the place itself but about the emotions and experiences I get when I'm there. For example, I would never recommend anyone to visit a big city to feel the real vibe of human population, but a small town, like Lastingham, can be a magical place.


Bruce lives in a small town called Lastingham, located in the Yorkshire Moors between Leeds and Harrogate, England. While the local post office might not be very exciting, Bruce's favorite places in Lastingham are the following:

- The castle of Fountains (where he hid from the snowstorm when he was 8 years old)
- The old town hall, dating back to the 15th century
- A church with a beautiful old tower and a small garden around it.


Fountains Castle, a beautiful old town hall in Lastingham.

And the church with the beautiful"," At that time Lastingham consisted of just a few old mills and churches. I remember the smell of the river in the valley and the church with its incredible stained glass. Nowadays Lastingham is a town of around 40,000 people. My favourite cycle ride is to the Isle of Man, a small Irish Island just off the coast of Scotland. I get there by ferry from Ireland and then cycle around the Island. On my return I stop at Snaefell mountain where the Beatles filmed the first movie 'A Hard Day's Night'. I cycle from the summit down to where they filmed the second movie 'Help!' Snaefell mountain has an extraordinary combination of steep slopes, rough terrain and views across the sea to the Irish mainland. 

Choose three places which Bruce enjoys visiting and why.


I go to Lastingham on Saturdays because the smell of the river and the church with its incredible stained glass attract me. Lastingham a few old mills and churches attract me because it consists of just a few old mills and churches, and when I was eight I went away to school in England, on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. I like the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. It has an old temple which attract me and on the same I like the old mills and churches in the village of Lastingham.


Choose three places which Bruce enjoys visiting and why.


I go to Sna"," We had a small church and several old buildings and houses, and there I could wander and explore undisturbed by cars. I have been back there only once since then and was disappointed to find it had been swallowed up by housing estates.

What is it about human settlements that lure you?

Most of all, it's the people. It would be fascinating to live in a totally barren landscape devoid of human beings, but I just can't bring myself to do it. It would be equally fascinating to spend a year in a whole village without any contact with other human beings, but being stuck in a completely empty building would be equally lonely. In a large and active human society with all its associated social interaction, entertainment and variety, there is always something new to learn, something to laugh at, something to admire or become intoxicated by.

When I travel I always try and visit at least one place where humans live in great numbers, because that is usually where one finds the most interesting things going on. For example, it would be interesting to travel to a remote region where the local inhabitants still use horses and draft animals, but you can't get those animals because the land has been turned into a wildlife reserve, and all that's left is an old pub. And then there's the village of Lastingham, where I went away to school. If I hadn't gone there, I wouldn't have met anyone remotely as interesting as those people, who let me get"," I rode my bike over the crest of the hill. It was a beautiful day. I pedalled down the hill and on to the road. I was on my way to Lastingham to visit the village church. As I approached it I saw people walking in the village street. It was very pretty. I noticed people were wearing clothes from a bygone era. Most of them were old. The women's attire was long dresses and coats with high shoes and stockings. I saw children and an old man wearing a suit. The children were in shorts and school shirts. I wondered why the old man was dressed in such out of date clothes. When I reached the church, the people I had seen in the street were all in the congregation. The village people I'd seen on my bike ride to Lastingham were now milling about outside the church. They were looking at me. There was something magical about the scene and I felt connected to the old people and the scene as if I was a part of the gathering. When the service was over the old people came over to me. I said thank you for coming to church. They asked me where I had come from and when I said Lastingham they congratulated me. The village was beautiful but I wasn't a fan because the people and the scene were beautiful but I was also disheartened by what was old and out of date. As I left I heard people saying don't forget to come back in the summer.

"," Lastingham had a small church, a pub and a small shop, very typical of English villages. One weekend I went cycling again with my father and on the way home we stopped in a small village. We had lunch and my father suggested we go and see the church, but I felt the need to go into the village shop. While my father browsed at the counter, I looked around the tiny shop. On the shelves above the counter were bottles of whiskey and beer, tobacco, soap, matches, and some old vinyl records. To my 8-year-old mind that was a bit weird. I turned to my father and said: ""This is not like a real shop. It's like a storage place for things people don't need any more. I do not like it"". ""Oh come on, it's like that in every village"", he said. ""I want to go and look at the church now, just you wait here"", I told him and went to the counter. To my dismay I saw that the man behind the counter was already preparing a package of cigarettes. I felt really bad and looked at the other things on the shelves. I couldn't believe that a real shop like that didn't even have a selection of records! I decided to go and look for the records myself. Unfortunately there were none. In my frustration I picked up a bottle of whiskey. I felt really bad. I took the bottle and threw it on the floor and broke it."," We had a small old church, the vicarage and several lovely old cottages. I miss it very much.

'The hostess has hired a band and they will all be in their dinner jackets' she continued. 'And there will be champagne and fruitcake and a grand illumination of the house. After the first three rounds of the band everyone will dance.' 'That sounds more like a party than a murder.' said Colonel Easterbrook. 'And why shouldn't it?' said his wife.

Archie is a typical stereotype of an India made up of people who are ignorant, uncaring and selfish. The story is written in the third person, making it sound as if it is an outside observer's view of the marriage. Mrs Easterbrook's comment 'These reporters know nothing about India' is therefore a commentary on how the foreign reporters are ignorant of India and the country's customs and traditions. Archie's comment 'If they did they wouldn't write such rubbish' is also a reflection of his opinion on what the foreign reporters write.

Although Archie is ignorant, he is a caring husband and pays attention to what his wife says. He has a negative"," You know Little Paddocks, they have a large duck pond and you remember the gamekeeper killed the ducks in it the last time we were there. Well now they are announcing a murder and it will take place on the 29th of October.' 'What is the gamekeeper's name' 'Doug' said Archie. 'Doug who?' 'Doug Wright' said his wife. 'Oh yes' said Archie. 'The dead man's name is Smith, Henry Smith.' 'So it is!' said his wife. 'Archie can you remember the date we went to Little Paddocks three years ago, on the 29th of October?' 'No.' 'I don't think you ever went. Doug Wright and I went that day.' 'Yes I went. It was a brilliant sunny day. The gamekeeper was away, I don't remember if it was a Mr or Mrs Wright.' 'It wasn't a Mr Wright, it was an old Mrs Wright' said his wife. 'What! The same woman who shot the ducks this time?' 'Yes.' 'But she is 81 years old and cannot have been the same woman. I believe her son is at Oxford' said Archie. 'Oh yes, Smith junior, but I haven't seen him in thirty years, the last time was when my mother died. That was 10 years ago, before I met your father.' 'What do you mean' asked Archie. 'I don't know."," After the announcement four Indian students - Abhishek, Gaurav, Puneet and Kulwant - are seen heading down Little Paddock, but at the bottom of the lane three men are waiting - Dara, Babloo and Dolly. It is clear that Dolly is the leader and he is holding a large knife.' When the story was complete Colonel Easterbrook said to his wife 'that certainly was some story.'

'Archie' continued reading the newspaper 'I think I know who wrote that story. I think that Indian journalist -  Dolly - is the grandson of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India.' 'I think you are right' said his wife 'and now there is something else I wish to tell you' Archie looked up 'yes?' 'Mrs Easterbrook, this week we had an interesting visitor at the house.' Colonel Easterbrook looked up 'who?' 'An Indian gentleman who is the Chief Justice's grandson.' 'Indeed?' said Colonel Easterbrook. 'Indeed' said the Colonel as he looked up 'and he had an unusual request to make of us.' 'Of us? What was that?' 'He asked us to forward this newspaper to the Chief Justice and to let him know of our gratitude.' 'Our gratitude? Why do you think he would want to know our gratitude?' 'I don't know. But I am sure the Chief Justice will be very grateful.' 'I hope so' said","''What the...?' cried Colonel Easterbrook. 'Six thirty sharp' said Mrs Easterbrook. 'Whatever shall we do?'

Colonel Easterbrook looked at the time. 'It's only 5 minutes to six' he said. He rushed downstairs and opened the windows of the living room to let in some fresh air. He returned, just in time to see 'Archie' rushing down the stairs. 'Did you hear what she said? A murder's going to happen on Friday October 29th!' 'Who cares?' said Archie. 'I just got this letter from India. There's going to be a murder on October 29th and it is going to happen at Little Paddocks.' 'Come on let's go and watch.' 'No way. I'm going to bed.' 'But... I... want to see for myself.' 'Well you won't want to watch when you hear what's going on. You'll see you won't be able to hold back your tears.'

Colonel Easterbrook looked into his wife's eyes. 'Come on dear. There's no need for hysterics. Let's go to bed.' And so saying he walked slowly upstairs. 'Archie, there is going to be a murder on October 29th. You'd better get a plane to Delhi right away.' 'Oh come on wife, let's not over-exert ourselves. It could be a false alarm. Let's go to bed.' 'No"," Murder, murder, murder. The Chief Minister says this is a planned murder but I disagree. The police say they have no leads and have asked for your assistance.' 'How can I assist you?' asked Archie. 'Well,' said his wife 'this sounds very much like the murder of Mrs Lillian Marsden. The police are anxious to find out who killed her. She was last seen alive on Friday October 22nd at her home in Little Paddocks. She was a widow and used to work as a housekeeper at the Manor House. The police are looking for any one of the Manor House servants who may have had a grudge against her. The police have also questioned everyone at the Manor House but have come up with nothing. We think it is more than likely that the person or persons unknown will attempt to murder Mrs Marsden again and we are appealing to you, our son, to go to Little Paddocks on Friday October 29th to ascertain if you can recognise the woman who was last seen with Mrs Marsden and to inform the police if she or anyone resembling her presents himself or herself. Archie agreed to go to Little Paddocks on Friday October 29th and do what his wife had asked of him. When he arrived at the Manor House late on the 28th he told the butler, Mr Brown, of his intention to visit Little Paddocks. Mr Brown warned him of the possible danger he might face as a result of his presence there","  The Inspector will announce the name of the victim and say who killed him. The Inspector will say nothing will be missed and there will be no questions asked.  The suspect will be Mrs Amarjeet Kaur, a.k.a. Amar (Dancing Girl) who runs the local sweet shop. She will be accompanied by her friend, Joginder Singh, a.k.a. Joginder, who works in the local post office. The witness will be Jasmine, a.k.a. Jassi, a local schoolgirl.'


Mrs Easterbrook gave a knowing look to her husband and said 'Yes, I read that in the paper today.' Her husband looked up from the Times and said 'What? The paper?' 'The Sunday Times, here in Rourkela.' 'Oh.'

Mrs Easterbrook then went on to tell him about the forthcoming murder, while her husband continued to read the newspaper.

Kitty Doherty, careers adviser

Psychometric tests are not for the faint-hearted, but having a careers adviser on hand can ensure you find the right job for your potential. The careers adviser will help you find a role that suits your skills and interests, but will also help you to build up your CV and identify opportunities at work that might be a better fit for your current skills.

A careers adviser will also help you to establish whether you would like to become a career adviser or an employee at a charity. This can give you a chance to use your skills and experience in an environment that you are really passionate about, but one that doesn’t require you to wear a suit every day or go to a boardroom.

You can find a careers adviser using the organisations that have been set up by the Careers Centre. These include:

When you sit down for psychometrics, you will be shown some images and asked to categorise them into what you see as related versus unrelated categories.  

For example, you might be shown a picture of a swimming pool.  You would be asked to categorise this as either'related' or 'unrelated'.

Rachel Mills loves going to the ocean. The sea is deep and dark and it's the perfect place to feel completely alone. Rachel likes to dive to the deepest parts of the ocean and swim in the cold waters. She also enjoys exploring coral reefs, where she can touch strange and beautiful animals, such as the hammerhead shark. 

One day while Rachel was swimming off the coast of Ireland, she suddenly got out of the water and started shivering. ""What's wrong?"" she asked her friend, a PhD student named John. ""I've just remembered I'm due to give a lecture tomorrow in Belfast,"" John answered. ""But I can't come - the boat I was on capsized off the coast of Ireland,"" Rachel said, her voice breaking. John started to explain to her that the boat was a research vessel conducting underwater archaeology. ""It was due to dive to a particular location near the coast, but now we won't be able to find it,"" John said. 
Rachel's heart dropped. ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry,"" she said. ""I'll have to find a new hotel."" John was shocked. ""No, I'm sorry, we haven't had this problem before. It's quite a way away, and the weather can change so quickly that it's very hard to plan,"" he said. ""I could come with you. We could swim in a smaller boat and you could bring enough clothes and"," 

One day while out on the boat Rachel notices something unusual. The water is actually HOT. HOTTER than it should be! It is as hot as the inside of a coffee cup. Rachel asks her colleague Richard about it and Richard swims over and tells her that they are in a submarine volcano and that this is the hottest temperature ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. The volcano is called Atlantis IV and it is a British Ocean Research Ship and a scientific research platform.

Rachel swims back to the research boat and tells the crew that they need to get out of there, now. They immediately dive the ship and try to reverse the situation. First they lower the temperature to normal sea level and it works. Then they raise the temperature and the temperature becomes even hotter as they head to the surface.  Rachel also tells the crew that she will keep an eye out for the volcano and find them. 

Within a couple of days they see smoke coming from the volcano and it turns out to be hot air from a jet engine. They managed to raise the temperature just enough to make it into the headlines. People all over the world started noticing and now the name of the volcano is 'The Hot Spot' due to all the press it is getting.

Rachel continues to study volcanoes and other geological features in the sea. She was even part of a research expedition to one of the most well-known underwater volcanoes, under the"," She spends several months each year conducting research in the ocean. Rachel Mills loves nothing more than being in the water but every year she hates going to the ocean because of the high acid levels that come from the ocean water. 
  
Scientists have found that even though Rachel Mills loves the ocean she probably would not survive more than a few minutes in the water and she certainly wouldn't survive more than 30 minutes if her the water had high levels of acidity. Rachel Mills is very concerned about the high acid levels in the ocean and wants to help raise awareness of the problem and change the situation. Rachel Mills has designed a special underwater suit which she uses to perform experiments to determine how fast different animals can swim across various different levels of ocean acid levels. Rachel Mills has taken her suit to the bottom of the ocean where the high acidity levels are and is having a great deal of fun and learning new things. 
  
Rachel Mills designed her suit herself and it took her four months to make the suit, a very difficult task. Her suit is made up of different types of material to keep the acid out and it works extremely well. Rachel Mills would still rather not go to the ocean but at least now she has a new way to be in the ocean, learn about it and contribute to the oceanographic study of the ocean.

This is the first part of the story:

The story starts with a large population living in a tight cluster of buildings in the Chinese town of Kowloon. The buildings have no official ownership and the people living inside have no legal protection. 

Tensions are running high and fighting seems unavoidable. 

So, two Chinese military officers travel to the city to quell the unrest. They find no one living in the buildings. Then they discover a secret society. The members are living without legal protection in the buildings and they will fight to the death against anyone entering their secret society. 

One of the officers then informs the rest of the military that no one will enter the city anymore. The whole city is lawless now. 

They return to Beijing and tell their superior that they have succeeded. They then set up an ambush to kill all the members of the secret society to make sure that they won't interfere in the future. 

The people start coming out of the buildings. All of them want to join the secret society. Then the military officer sees one of the members. She is very beautiful. He tries to intervene and tries to stop the members from joining the secret society. The military officer and his men attack the secret society. But the members are very strong and they kill all the military men and take the beautiful woman hostage. 

The woman pleads for her life saying that she had joined this secret society to escape the lawless"," 

The Walled City was born out of necessity. In the 17th century Hong Kong was already a prosperous trading port where life was cheap and easy. At that time, the island was covered by swamp and hillocks. Chinese merchants realised that if they could live in buildings that were completely walled off from the mainland they could avoid taxes which were imposed on land based businesses.

Walled City stories are well documented in the book ""Walled City: Life and Death in Hong Kong's Most Forgotten Slum"", written by Marcus Chui and published by Harper Collins.

There was no running water. There was no sanitation. The buildings were poorly constructed and prone to flooding. The tenement blocks were packed with people who had nowhere else to live. The Walled City was a unique community where people were free to live and create. The Chinese government thought it a shame the city was gone."," It was completely lawless. It had no police force. There was no rule of law and no power. 

Kowloon Walled City was a part of Hong Kong until it became a special administrative region of China in 1997. It had a unique culture and way of life. The lawless environment led to many problems like crime. This story is from Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City.

  
Kowloon Walled City had no wall around it. Standing apart from the neighbouring buildings it rose to fourteen floors-buildings with more buildings piled on top. Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there. It was completely lawless. It had no police force. There was no rule of law and no power. 

In 1844, after many failed attempts to find buyers, the British finally gave up their plans to convert the then New Territories into a resettlement area for theChinese to settle. However they did not abandon the idea of using the City as a place for Chinese to live in.  

Amidst all their planning for the resettlement, one thing they did not plan for was how to ensure the safety of the Chinese living in the City. The first Chinese police force in the world was established in the City in 1891. As the years went by, the Chinese people living in the Walled City"," 

Kowloon Walled City had no wall around it. Standing apart from the neighbouring buildings it rose to fourteen floors-buildings with more buildings piled on top. Legally it belonged to the People's Republic of China a part of the colony that was never British. In fact neither Chinese nor British law had effect there.

The residents of Kowloon Walled City did not pay taxes. They did not have to register their addresses. And they could not buy or sell real estate without the government's approval. 

The Walled City was not walled from the start. Chinese settlers built their homes on the outside, and Chinese workers lived in the huts on the inside. And the residents were happy with that arrangement: there was plenty of space for everyone. 

But the residents of Kowloon Walled City also needed more space for their businesses and the homes of family and friends, so they began to expand into the nearby streets.

This attracted the attention of the People's Liberation Army, who had ruled the Chinese mainland for sixty years. They had strict rules about the construction of walls and the opening of gates, but no one was enforcing them. And so Kowloon Walled City grew. 

Some residents liked living outside the city walls and even built their houses on hills so they could take in more of the city. But others fought to keep their houses and even fought to keep their families. 

People had once been afraid"," It was known as an area of exception where rules didn't apply. The people of Kowloon knew how to live there. 

There were many illegal businesses where no business licence was required and no taxes were paid. Drugs, prostitution and human trafficking were all legal. However, in 1984 the Chinese authorities tried to clean up the area by bulldozing many buildings to make way for a planned high rise district. This caused outrage among the residents of the city. 

Fights erupted among the angry residents. One man named Kenichi Osada, a resident of the city and a self-taught artist, used an  anarchist’s approach to put an end to the evictions. He took to the streets painting walls with various graffiti messages, slogans and designs. In his statement to reporters, Osada says, “Painting walls is my right. The Chinese government has committed many crimes against my city. I will continue until my city is free”. 

The wall painting spread and became viral on the Chinese web. This attracted the attention of the Chinese government who in December 2009 gave the people of the Kowloon Walled City a second chance to rebuild their city. Today you can visit the Kowloon Walled City and see for yourself what it was like before and after the bulldozing.

So, he gathered together the best architects, planners, builders and engineers from all over the city and they began work on the project. Over the next few years, the Model Village grew and developed as a thriving city within the city. But some people didn't like the Model Village. They complained that there were too many people living in the Village and that the buildings were too tall, forcing residents to climb up to the top floor to find better views of the city. These criticisms didn't stop Lord Mayor or his councilors from living their lives as they had always done before the Model Village development.

  We were completely wrong. The entire park is just as great as Fun Island, it's just that it's a smaller park and there's not as much to do there. We spent 2 hours exploring the park and were able to do everything that Fun Island had to offer. My 5 year old son and my 13 month old daughter both absolutely loved it. It's got so many rides and things to do that they had a hard time choosing. They both had a great time and wouldn't want to go anywhere else. This year I'm going to take the whole family.

Fun Island opened last year this year so it's got time to get to grips with things. Plus we've got another two children who've just been born and are likely to be even more interested this year. We'll be spending our time on the rides and getting wet, even if the rain isn't turning out to be the most sunny of days! 

We enjoyed our visit. I'm not sure we could have done it all, but we would have done some of it.

My 5 year old son and my 13 month old daughter both absolutely loved it. They both had a great time and wouldn't want to go anywhere else.

We enjoyed our visit. I"," That was when we visited with five Britons. Theirs was a full day on the water slide, in the tree house, on the wild waterslide and on the pirate ship. Even when they were taking big tumbles and breaking arms they still managed to have fun because they were having fun together. 

There are also lots of attractions to choose from in the UK, you just need to be creative. Here are five fun things that the Burns family did at Fun Island: We went on the water slide in the shape of a huge rainbow. On the back of a seaplane. We tried the Trevira rope swing. Next we drove the go-kart track. We ate some of our lunch on the pirate ship and watched the show when we were too hot.

This is a great park for all ages and a fun family day out for all to enjoy. 

The first thing we did when we arrived at Fun Island was take our tickets to a check-in desk. Fun Island has lots of rides and attractions, but each ticket is valid for one ride only. Then we went to a huge play area on a high teeter-totter. Our oldest daughter took the teeter-totter and our youngest tried it for the first time. She did not quite understand the instructions but loved the sensation of riding up and down on the balance beams. She didn't know what was coming next, but as it happened she was about to have an"," But this year our five year old loved it so much that we booked again for next year. And then we found that Fun Island was in fact the best by a wide margin. The only problem was that we had to wait until July. That turned out to be fine as we got to enjoy the sunny days then. The main difference between this and other options was that Fun Island actually had activities and things to do - although of course they had to be on a very large scale to make everything work! For example, the park had rides, slides and other attractions in a fantastic waterpark kind of way, and there was an extensive area for food and drink including a small shop. We also loved the large selection of rides and attractions for all ages. The only thing we disliked was that there were no animals to look at. Overall we were happy and would definitely go again. Tasty Tricks - The Davies family Last year we went to a theme park and there was a ride that had dinosaurs. The children were very excited and looked forward to this every time we went. This year the dinosaur on the ride was broken, so there was no point going again. But when we found this out we were surprised - surely they would have told us when we booked? What they did tell us was that the dinosaur was broken for three months of the year and in another six months it would be working. And in that time we would need to go and try it out. We"," The theme is ""bumpy water adventure"" and we thought there would be more slides and rides but in fact there wasn't. The rides there didn't look that different from the rides at Disneyland in California. The one ride there that was similar to the one in California was the Bump 'n' Grind ride at Fun Island. The Bump 'n' Grind is similar to the Bump 'n' Jump ride in California but it's got a couple of difference elements. There's an inductor machine that cranks it, and you can drive it backwards and forwards. We didn't like that one bit! Instead we chose the Pirates of the Caribbean ride for our second day. Pirates is a lot more fun. The Pirates ride looks more exciting than the Bump 'n' Grind and it's got more rides and attractions: there's a swinging bridge ride, a treasure hunt, and a ride on a pirate ship. You can choose from this list of rides on the website to see how they compare: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operating_pirate_ships#/media/File:List_of_pirate_ships.svg

However, we remembered that Disneyland in California has many rides with similar names to those at Fun Island. When we"," We're right; there are only two slides. Neither of them are particularly steep and the water is a little too cool. The park is otherwise well laid out, with a small lagoon and plenty of room to run around. The staff are friendly and helpful and there are lots of activities for children to do. The price is right too - just two admission fees for the whole weekend. Overall, a good experience but we'd definitely go again. My family - Five year old, Mum, Dad, son and daughter Last year my family and I went to a theme park in the US and we weren't too keen on it. The park was very nice though and there were loads of things to do. There were slides and pools and boats to hire and it was fairly safe for young children. The staff were all really nice and we all had a good time. The park is in an impressive grounds but there was little to see as you had the whole park to yourself. We'd recommend it but only if you have a car. My family - Three year old daughter, Father, son, and I myself Last year my wife, daughter, and I went to a theme park in the US. We weren't interested in the park but I'm happy to take my family over there again. They have several rollercoasters and water slides. The water is a little too cold for us but the staff were great and the park is lovely. It doesn't have much to see as a family"," We decided to ask five people who go to theme parks regularly to give us their opinion. Mum - Fun Island is really good, we visited every day, the rides are nice and there's a great food area. We've done all of the rollercoasters and there's another one we've missed. We've also had loads of fun on the rides with the walkie talkies. 
  
Mum - Fun Island is a very good theme park, it's got the usual rollercoasters, rides and all the food you would expect from a theme park, however it's got something that most theme parks don't, it's got walkie talkies. They're not in every ride and every food area, but they're there. We've used them for games on the rides too. They're not the best at Disneyland - there's things there that are better than theirs, but it's a brilliant theme park and they have something different. We'd definitely recommend it. 
  
Mum - It's good, it's a bit like Disneyland but I like it because it has the rides that Disneyland doesn't have. It's a bit of a luxury to be able to go to the park every day. It's got things I like, like the walkie talkies. I've used them for games, I'll sit on the side of the ride with them so I'm on the screens. I didn't expect it but I"," We were right. The rides were dull, the children aged 4 and 6 screamed the place down and there wasn't enough to keep them amused. However, we were pleasantly surprised. It was a very different experience, the children had loads of fun and were still giggling 15 mins later. The best thing was they were laughing together and were happy to get stuck into all the activities. We are definitely going again this year. Mum's Choice -  The Williams family We were very excited to go to Fun Island, we've heard wonderful things from friends and the children loved the Harry Potter ride. The parks opening hours are flexible and the children had fun for 2 hours, 1 hour and 45 minutes all told. Mum's choice this year would be to include some food and a drink with the purchase of admission and to make the park an option in the itinerary. The wide choice of food outlets seemed to please everyone, with plenty of high protein snacks for the 6 year old and hot food for the 2 year old. We will definitely be going again and Mum's choice for next time would be to include a few rides for the adults, such as the high speed ride, dark ride or the rollercoaster. We enjoyed our day at Fun Island and can highly recommend it. A+ - The Potts family The park was very well presented and had a wide range of rides and attractions for all ages.

I've always been interested in learning something new, so I think it's in the subject I'm interested in, not necessarily the exercise, that you're most likely to feel the effects of the stimulus-response loop.' C. Elizabeth Marsden Attorney: 'I get a lot of energy by helping others - doing something creative to make someone else's day better. I am a social worker, so this has been a big part of my life. I also enjoy spending time outdoors. I live in the beautiful mountains of North Carolina, and often enjoy hiking or skiing. I can often be found at one of the many swimming pools throughout the region where my children can see me, as I often swim throughout the day, though my adult children live several states away.' D. Carolyn Mathers Retired: 'I get lots of energy by walking. It's calming. I do two miles daily. When I lived on the West Coast it was the Pacific Coast Highway - I'd just have to get in my little convertible and go. My husband loved it and so did I. I live in the Sierras"," I also run marathons and that's a whole other way of exciting yourself. You know, that's also a very full way of living your life.' B. Claire Beaver Financial advisor: 'I get my energy from reading. So many books. They've become a way of seeing and learning and understanding. I feel like that's the type of reading I want to do. I'm just trying to get through as many books as I can.' C. Mary Beard Historian: 'I get my energy from writing. I really enjoy writing so I think it's the pleasure of writing itself that gets me going. So I write for a living, that helps also. And I also try to spend time with my friends and my family.

I think it is knowing that you are not the only one going through something new and tackling it head-on. So many of us are in an unhappy state, unhappy work, unhappy relationships, so to just know that you are not alone and that you are not crazy, that you are not the only one that feels this way - it really helps.'

" But I was so frustrated by the way I felt. I decided I had to find out what made other people confident. So I read as much as I could about leadership and assertiveness training and after a few years of dedicating myself to the subject I finally became confident. I still can't imagine how I did it, but I just went to events and asked questions where I could really put myself out there. And that's how I became confident. 
  

 Nina Hathway

  Jenny: I was so frustrated by the way I felt. I decided I had to find out what made other people confident. So I read as much as I could about leadership and assertiveness training and after a few years of dedicating myself to the subject I finally became confident. I still can't imagine how I did it, but I just went to events and asked questions where I could really put myself out there. And that's how I became confident. 
  

 Nina Hathway

  Elyse: I worked very hard at public speaking and practicing. In high school I even placed second in speech competitions.  
  

 Nina Hathway

  Elyse: My dad was very supportive. He coached me and helped me with public speaking from a young age. I've always been naturally outgoing and I've never found it difficult to speak in public.

 Nina Hathway

  Elyse: I think the most important thing is just getting out"," So when someone asked me to give a talk I was really nervous. I asked my friends what I should say. They said 'Jenny, just share your enthusiasm about what you want to say.' That advice really helped me to feel more comfortable on stage. A Gareth I used to work in a very small shop where I had to work on my own and I really struggled to get people to trust me. So I worked on building up my confidence - I told myself things like 'Gareth, everyone trusts you as much as they do themselves so just go for it.' After I'd been working in the shop for a while, I started to see my bosses more regularly - this made me feel confident and more like I belonged. A Charlotte I was a quiet child - I was bullied at school and I think that affected my confidence. So when I left school and went to university, I made sure I kept up to date with work and started to volunteer at student societies. I then found out that I had to prove myself in extra-curricular activities before I was allowed to join a committee. That was nerve-wracking, but I've since had the satisfaction of helping student societies do really well in competitions. A Nina I didn't do much to build my confidence. As far as I knew I had always been confident. In fact my family were fairly anxious about my speaking in public, so I don't think I developed much confidence until I started my own business after university"," I thought my colleagues thought I was stupid and didn't understand the topics we were taught. I was sure they didn't want to work with me. I hated school, so I figured I'd never be any good at it. But when I joined the team at the firm where I now work, I learned to develop my confidence in front of the clients. That helped me to feel safe enough to say what I knew. I was taught how to believe in myself. I had to learn to trust my own opinions, even when I disagreed with the experts. And I had to learn how to be firm about how I felt. But mostly I had to be confident. That takes confidence.


Jenny I was very shy when I was at school and I was convinced that everyone thought I was stupid. So I spent years being quiet and keeping to myself. But when I started my job, I had to work with people who didn't know me and didn't like me - I had to prove myself. That meant I had to develop my confidence. I had to learn to believe in myself and to be firm about how I felt. And eventually I had to learn that no-one else believed in me unless I believed in myself too.


Nina I was sure that my colleagues didn't want to work with me. I kept thinking that they must think I was stupid and I didn't want to work with me. But when I started working with the people at the firm where"," But when I left school, I had to talk to a lot of people and so I started to speak to them. Then, my Mum said to me ""Don't be afraid speak to people"" so I got to learn to speak to people and now I'm a confident person. An Alan It's a mixture. I think if you want to be confident you need to feel very comfortable in social situations and, in general, be generally approachable. A Chris It is true that if you are very shy and don't like people you can be very shy for life so, it's helpful to be approachable and to like people. A Rachel I started to speak to people when I was about 10. If I didn't have to speak to children I wouldn't speak to adults, which is probably what happened before I was 10. So that's what I started to do and now I'm a confident person.

Use the comments box to provide some context to the people that the children are learning about. For example, state how many people they are and that they have a Mum and Dad. Include a link to their photo on Flickr.

#  Making text more accessible

Text is a powerful tool and it is important that it is used correctly in order to provide information to a reader in a clear and accessible manner.

The most common accessibility issues with text are not related to using text to convey information. Common accessibility issues relate to font size, colour,", It wasn't until I was living in America that I realised I had to learn to talk to people and that I didn't have to be shy. I really had to work at it. A Bill I used to think I was too old to learn these things but thankfully I had to learn them as I got older. I'm still learning new things but as a result of having to learn those I'm a lot more confident. I think confidence comes from how you perceive things and your willingness to learn things. A Chris I didn't realise how much I didn't know. When I first got to university I found it very scary and felt very overwhelmed but thanks to a lot of self-help and books I read I now feel much more comfortable around other people. I feel like I know more now than I did when I first started. A Laura I was actually pretty confident when I was at school but didn't realise it. My school teachers told me to come to their office to talk so I found it easier to do that. But I remember thinking that I didn't really have anything to say and I didn't want to seem weird. And that's when I started reading books. I read books about being confident and how to talk to people and I tried it and it worked! A2 learners may find this interesting: it's possible to increase your confidence by practising being more assertive. Nina Hathway is confident. Bill is confident. Chris has increased his confidence since he," But I made a promise to myself that I would speak up in meetings and I've never looked back. I don't have a secret, I just put in the practice. Alex When I first started working I was very nervous and I would often say nothing. But then I found a mantra that helped me; I would just remember to say ""yes, that can be arranged"" to everything that was asked of me. I still say to this day ""yes, that can be arranged"" to everything. Nick This is the hardest part but I have always been a very confident person. I think of something to say at every possible opportunity. I make it my mission to meet everyone half way. I do this by asking probing questions but also by listening intently. Then I try to find a common ground with the other person and hope it becomes an ice breaker and we end up getting to know each other. I do not have a secret, just put in the practice.

A:

I think I was lucky, being that I was always very confident. My father is a construction manager and he is always pointing at things, making comments about how the workers are doing a good job. I often ask him questions about things I don't understand and he always patiently explains things in a way that makes sense to me. As a result, I always had a lot of confidence"," To get out of my head I joined a group of students who were going out to socialise and try to find a mate. When we got home my parents didn't know what to do. They were worried that I was making a fool of myself but I didn't care. I made up all these stories for my parents of me being a world class athlete or a doctor. I was already doing a PGCE in my spare time so that seemed to do the trick. My parents were so impressed with the truth in my stories that they got us the home computer and phone we needed. It worked. I could actually meet people and things have since escalated from there. 

A Mary That's how I got to grips with public speaking. It was the day at school that got me started. I was called to the front and as I approached the front the teacher started warming up the class for my presentation. I was standing there feeling very strange indeed. I was a new girl at school but I'd quickly settled in, so I was quite confident. I went to the front and they started speaking. I froze. I started to feel very self conscious and even though my presentation was about the rainforest, I felt very embarrassed and anxious. I mustered up the courage and courage and went to speak. It got better, I got better. That went on for months. My confidence went from zero to hero. Mary went on to say that's the secret: practice makes perfect"

" The kingfisher has come to gather food but there are no fish to be found. Charlie shouts 'where's the fish Charlie?!' and the kingfisher appears to frown deeply at him. 'fish', says the kingfisher, 'I looked and there are no fish.' 'How can you say that when I can see you have a fish in your beak!' 'No, I mean I looked, and there are no fish.' 'That's not possible, you can see they're there, can't you?' 'I didn't look, I just said there were no fish!' 

What happens when a kingfisher says ""I looked and there are no fish?"". Does it mean that the kingfisher actually couldn't see any fish, or does it mean that the kingfisher looked for a while but couldn't see any fish? And if the second option is correct, why doesn't the kingfisher keep on looking?

A:

It means that it looked but did not see any fish, for example when you look at a waterfall and cannot see the fish swimming below but the sound of the waterfall is very noisy suggesting there might be fish.

"," 

Old trees overhang the stream half shading shallow water. Soft greens mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze.

After taking many photos of kingfishers, Charlie finds one he really wants to study closer. It's sitting on a tree and appears to be in a very different place to any kingfisher Charlie has ever seen before. The kingfisher lifts its head to look intently at him. Charlie holds the camera up to his eye and slowly focuses on the object that is so clearly different to any kingfisher he has ever seen before. He begins to focus more and more until he is able to clearly see the pattern on the kingfisher's breast. He takes the photo and smiles.

A group of school children come up to Charlie to talk with him about his great photograph of the kingfisher. ""This is your best photo?"" asks one child. ""Oh yes,"" says Charlie ""it's one of my best.""

""Wow, that's amazing,"" says the group of children. They look at each other with awe and delight. ""Can we come back and see it?""

""Oh, that would be great,"" says Charlie, and as they start to walk away he calls out to them. ""Have you noticed anything different about the tree or the stream?""

One child looks back at him and says ""yes,","  

One day, whilst walking along the river at the Kingfisher's traditional haunt, Charlie sees a baby kingfisher being fed by its parents. He takes his lens and snaps a picture of the proud parents showing off their newly-fledged offspring.  

Later that evening, Charlie visits the nest and discovers that one of the eggs has broken and the little blue-green kingfisher has been forced to leave the nest to die.  

When Charlie sees this, his heart breaks for the kingfisher. He knows that he himself cannot catch a kingfisher, so he takes his camera to the stream again that evening, this time with a view to putting down a camera trap that will help the kingfisher and its nestlings to survive.

With dawn breaking he sees two kingfishers dive head-first for a fish. As they return to the nest with their catch, the camera catches their image and Charlie is able to see both parents feeding their nestlings, their tiny wings flashing in the early morning sun.  

As he takes his last picture of the happy family, Charlie feels a tear roll down his cheek. He has successfully trapped a kingfisher and the story of its family is not yet complete. 

Whilst this story is still true, Charlie has become a Wildlife photographer and knows that there are many other Kingfishers around the world.  

This is his story:  
"," He sits in the tree above the water and patiently waits for the right moment. The kingfisher has arrived, taking the best photos of the day. Charlie gets up and walks slowly down to the water. Suddenly he sees the kingfisher fly away and calls out to the other photographers and the conservationists watching on. Later that day as he walks home he passes the spot where the kingfisher has eaten. He feels so close to the kingfisher. The kingfisher makes news today, it is famous for the photos it takes. It will be hard to find another opportunity to get a good photo of the kingfisher.

It is the Kingfisher that he is focusing on.The kingfisher, which is also called the ""fish hawk"" because it fishes for fish with its wings, has a gorgeous, bright blue body, green back, white forehead, and brilliant yellow stripe along the side of its neck. Kingfishers have a foray of around thirty or forty species, and can be found in every continent but Antarctica, and can inhabit freshwater and marine environments, but tend to prefer clean, shallow water with a lot of vegetation. Their main prey is fish, which they catch by hovering motionless with their wings, looking down into the water and then snatching the fish with their beaks. In some areas, kingfishers are threatened by pollution and habitat destruction, and are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.

The kingfisher is unique among bird species as the only known aerial fisher. It hunts mainly by hovering flight, snatching fish from the surface with its beak. When diving, it changes altitude rapidly, hovering for a short time at the water surface and then gliding down to capture any fish that may have been disturbed by its movements. Kingfishers are found worldwide in the northern hemisphere, but are mostly found in Europe, North America, East Asia, Oceania and Africa south of the equator.

How do they finance their lifestyle? All very intriguing questions to which no one knows the answers. I found out the answers to the first two through a little programme I watched called 'Studio Audiences' on UK television channel C4. I had happened upon the channel when I turned on my television and heard this little man saying - 'C4 - your Channel Four'. As I watched the programme I found myself fascinated by the insight that people who worked in the television and film industry gave into what it was like to be an audience. I learnt that for most people watching television is a habit that they find engrossing and compelling and so we become members of their social universe. That's why we are in the audience for the latest popular show. We love it, we share it with our friends and sometimes we even pay money to watch it. There are also people in the audience for documentaries and talks which sometimes turn out to be very influential to mankind and so they too pay money to watch them. For us it is like being part of a secret society and it is for us as a member of this society that we pay for the channel so that we may watch these shows. In conclusion 'Studio Audiences' was a wonderful insight into the lives of people who work in the television and film industry and it set me off on an exploration of who we become as audience members of television and film.

There were people there, who were there to be entertained by watching us get surprised. Yet we were surprised and that is what makes the programme entertaining for us.

" But it wasn’t the navy that Chris actually wanted to join. He didn’t tell the teacher that the army might have been more to his taste. ‘The army will pay for me to go to Oxford,’ he explained, ‘and when I’m at Oxford I can buy myself a house.’ The following January, after he’d joined the army, they tried to recruit him into the navy. ‘No,’ he told them, ‘the navy won’t have me.’

Chris grew up in the navy - it was what he did - but not in the navy, the navy was the navy but not the navy - it was his home but not his home. When he grew up he moved back in with his parents. And his parents weren’t his parents anymore - they were the navy - they were the navy, but not the navy. He’d spent so long trying to be the navy that he had forgotten what being Chris Greener was - it was what he was when he was the navy. But he still lived with his parents. And his parents lived in the navy - the navy. They might be his parents now, but they always had been his parents, they had been his parents when he was Chris Greener, the navy, and when he was not the navy.

Chris Greener had been on a ship but not on a ship, he’d been to sea. That was one way of putting it. The other was"," She sent him to the navy, and three years later he was at the quarterdeck of a Trident submariner. Chris is a retired sub-Lieutenant now and his specialisms are the navy’s most famous nuclear deterrent, the Trident submarine, and the navy’s submarine force.


Chris is a role model and a talented sailor who has achieved much success. His story is a fascinating account of dedication, perseverance and the lengths to which some adults will go to help a student realise their potential. The use of specific detail such as Chris’ height is effective in enabling readers to understand the nature of his ambition and relate to his experience.


The story is also well referenced throughout with links to key concepts, resources and information. The addition of specific and relevant illustrations also makes an effective impact on the reader. For example, the use of an image of Chris alongside the Trident submarine is an apt pairing in helping readers understand the significance of the submarine to the navy and their role in ensuring global security.


While the tone of the story is that of a positive and inspirational tale, it also explores real-life challenges faced by Chris and others who wish to pursue a challenging but rewarding ambition. A key point made in the story is the importance of allowing students to take the lead in pursuing their dreams, allowing them to define realistic and achievable targets, and providing support and guidance to help them reach their goals. While perhaps at first read, this could"," In the end Chris joined the navy, was commissioned as an engineer officer, grew to be just over six feet in height and is now a captain in the British navy. Chris Greener was only fourteen. When I was fourteen I wanted to be a singer, but I'm nearly six feet tall now and am a captain in the British navy.  That was eighteen years ago and now I'm nearly six foot five inches tall and still in the navy. That’s the power of ambition!  

Here is what Chris said:  “I’m a product of the British education system. I think we are all getting too big for our boots - that was the attitude in my school when I told them I wanted to join the navy when I was fourteen. But when they saw I had become captain of a British navy ship, they suddenly realised I wasn’t just some ordinary teen after all, and I was awarded a medal for my efforts. We need to be more ambitious in our education and career choices, because when we make the right choices we can realise our dreams. “


Here is what I would say:  “I think it’s important to continue to dream and to never stop believing you can achieve your goals. The more you strive to reach those dreams the more you will realise that you actually can achieve them. “

There are three key messages in this story:  1) You should never give up on a dream despite the fact you think"," He had been measured when he was eleven. ‘No. The captain of a ship.’ ‘Oh, I see, the captain of the ship.’ ‘Well, that’s what I want to be then.’ The answer seemed to satisfy the teacher. Chris was accepted into the navy a year later. And a year after that he was afloat at sea on the training ship HMS Bulwark, the pride of the navy. Since then he has risen to become a battleship.


The prompt requires you to write a 2,500 word story using the following facts:

Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school.

Chris was measured eleven years earlier, when he was eleven years old.

Chris was accepted into the navy the following year.

A year after Chris became afloat on the training ship HMS Bulwark, the pride of the navy.

Chris has now risen to captain of the ship.


Here’s an example of a story that uses these facts.

It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship,' replied Chris. 'Oh, I see, the captain of a ship,' said the teacher"," His eyes bulged as he told the teacher about the ships he had seen in a dream; the huge size of the fleet compared to the small size of his island. He had seen the flagpole on a ship, the size of a small tree, towering over the island he lived on. 

This was in 2014, and now Chris is a fully commissioned officer in the navy, and is still only nineteen centimeters tall. The teacher was impressed, and that was all that mattered to Chris.

Chris has always loved the sea, which is why he ended up in the navy. In fact, he started the navy’s Sea Cadet Corps as a six year old, and still teaches the young cadets how to tie a reef knot. The navy is a demanding job, requiring Chris to be incredibly well co-ordinated, strong, and able to work in teams, to name but a few aspects of the job he has had to learn. He is also often called ‘Greeny’ which he enjoys, but hates the way his dad dotes on him.


Although the navy has been his career since he was fourteen years old, it’s unlikely that Chris will ever reach his flagpole in a ship. Despite being two metres tall, Chris is only nineteen centimeters tall. A typical adult man is around 25 cm tall. When he was fourteen, Chris was just over five feet tall. In the navy, Chris has to wear leg braces to keep","


The text you need to write a story for this prompt should have between 20 and 80 words, and between 2 and 20 sentences and 1 and 5 syllables.


Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris thought he was already two metres tall, he was getting quite big for his boots.


The story should be written in the third person, tell the reader what Chris wanted to be, what the teacher asked him, and what Chris answered. The sentence structure should be as follows:

Chris Greener

He wanted to be a flagpole on a ship.

The teacher asked him what he wanted to be.

Chris answered that he wanted to be a navy.


Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?'

Chris Greener


It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots.

But it’s also true - we’re all getting too small for our boots"," The navy was his first choice – he was a big fan of all things naval – but his mother worried that he’d be so tall he’d find it hard to do anything less strenuous than hanging from a flagpole.   

Chris Greener (aged 14) wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' his teacher asked. 'The flagpole on a ship?'   

Chris Greener: I wanted to join the navy when I left school because I loved all things naval, but my mother worried that I’d be so tall that I’d find it hard to do anything less strenuous than hanging from a flagpole.   

Teacher: I understand. I believe the navy is a good career choice, and perhaps you should consider it.  

Chris Greener: Thank you, Mrs. Brown. I will do that.

Teacher: Good. Now, let’s see if I can find something in the library for you to read.' She leafed through some books and eventually found one that had details of all the navy ships in the world and their national flags on their sails. 

Chris Greener: Oh, this is excellent! I love reading about other navy ships, their flags, and the challenges they faced. 

Teacher: It will be easy to read, I’m sure. And here is a list of websites we have for"
" What happened? Who was responsible? And why?


The massacre of the unarmed Indian citizens of Amritsar in April 1919 in response to protests over the citizenship legislation is known as the Amritsar massacre. The British government has always maintained that there was no massacre and the casualties were due to firing into a crowd. The Indian National Congress and several political parties have always maintained that the Indian National Army carried out the massacre and the government was attempting to cover up the crime. In 2000 an Indian Truth commission concluded that the British government was directly responsible for the massacre.


While the Amritsar massacre was undoubtedly a tragic event there is not enough evidence to determine who was responsible for it. There are multiple possible factors that could lead to the deaths of so many innocent people: the British government’s desire to suppress dissent, a poorly trained or poorly led Indian National Army, individual soldiers being ordered to commit unlawful acts, or the Indian National Congress using the incident to rally support for its political goals.


The Amritsar massacre had a profound effect on Indian-British relations. The British government apologized and made numerous concessions, although these were reversed in the years that followed. In addition, a plaque has been put in place at the memorial in Amritsar to remember “all those who lost their lives in the Amritsar Massacre” (the plaque doesn’t specify which groups are commemorated). Although this plaque is meant to honor the dead, it has created more","

One of the stories retold in the April 1919 issue of 'The Pioneer' is about a young man named Jogindar Singh who defied the general and took command of the small force of Indian soldiers that tried to stop the firing. Jogindar led a bayonet charge that pushed the British troops back and was himself wounded but he was not killed. Jogindar's brave leadership won the day for the Indian soldiers and ended the massacre. 

When Jogindar Singh was a child living in a village called Balwhah in the district of Patiala, he worked hard to save up enough money to go to Amritsar to fight for the Indian Empire against the British rulers. But Jogindar's village was surrounded by British troops and soon afterwards he too was arrested and taken to Amritsar where he was to be tried and shot. 

Jogindar Singh's lawyer, who knew a lot about Indian law, worked hard to have Jogindar Singh declared not guilty but to no avail. Jogindar Singh's friends and family were shocked and decided to take matters into their own hands. Some even tried to stop Jogindar from being executed but Jogindar refused to give in to his fear and shouted at them to fight for your freedom instead.

Last week I drove one of these though it was more like flying a small plane than driving. I admit, it does look the coolest thing I’ve ever driven.

I’d like to share my first impressions of GM’s EN-V in tandem with Telegraph Motoring’s review. It feels very similar to a motorcycle in terms of the handling, though with much better brakes and a higher centre of gravity for a two-wheeler. It also feels slightly less nimble than a motorcycle, but feels much more stable and stable. 

Overall the EN-V is definitely a very nice vehicle that offers many potential applications in urban transport. However, I do think there needs to be a higher entry cost that makes it a viable proposition for many people, especially in urban settings, where the EN-V struggles to find space to manoeuvre. The low centre"," The EN-V uses a combination of pedal power and human power to supplement the electric motor that powers the two wheels. I drove it using my feet.

Mike has a preview of the EN-V and takes it for a spin.

One thing you need to be aware of with electric two-wheelers, especially the cheaper ones, is the tendency to 'hover'. This means the front wheel turns freely but without applying pressure to the ground. This can give you a bit of a lift, but not a comfortable one.

I decided to try out the EN-V on a local shopping centre in Milton Keynes. There was plenty of footpath, and I zipped around the complex at a reasonable speed, but I wasn't feeling comfortable. 

The EN-V requires both pedal and human power to move. 

I started off by pedaling the EN-V as hard and as fast as I could. This gave it enough momentum to take off. I was flying! I didn't need to apply any more power or force to the EN-V. It was like controlling an airplane with my feet. 

As I got used to the feeling of flying, I started applying more force to the EN-V. I was surprised at how well I could control the EN-V by applying a little extra force to the pedals. 

The EN-V has enough power to"," I can't wait to get one of my own.

I loved the idea of the Electric Nissan GT-R. The wheels, the handling, the styling. But that's just me.


Well, I couldn't wait to try it. We got one the following week.


We strapped ourselves in. I couldn't wait to try the new car.


The EN-V felt odd at first. The weight and balance felt different. But we got the hang of it.


We had a ball for the first ten miles. It's a lot of fun. I'm loving it.


After an hour and a half we pulled into a shopping mall. We still had some way to go but it was fun.


And I was loving it. We had a great car. I couldn't wait to get one of my own.


The EN-V's definitely unique.


And I loved it.


#

And that's the way it is."," The EN-V takes off like a helicopter the only difference is it has 4 wheel traction. This allows the vehicle to move quicker and more efficiently through the air. If you are short on space then this could be the vehicle for you. So short on space that you need to be able to fit your whole family in.


Mike Rutherford: Hello. This is Mike Rutherford from Telegraph Motoring. I've been driving one of these EN-Vs for the last couple of weeks and have to say I've been a fan since I first clapped eyes on it. It's an urban transportation vehicle that operates like a helicopter. You need very little room to carry a passenger and the battery can be charged by plugging it into a wall. The only problem I've found so far is that it's been hard to balance the EN-V because it's so light.


GM: When you first clapped eyes on it, you said you were a fan. What did you think of it?

MR: I loved it. It's such an original concept and I am a fan of anything that makes cities more accessible. I could see it being particularly useful in smaller towns. This is a concept that is going to gain huge traction.


GM: You can charge the EN-V by plugging it into a wall and it takes off like a helicopter. How does it work?

MR: It takes off like a helicopter.

"," It's very smooth and compliant and very stable. The controls on the EN-V are intuitive and make driving a bike feel natural.  It's all very neat and tidy. You can load it up with any number of people and it's a practical means of transportation. However, the design could definitely be better. The wheels are really low and close together. This makes the EN-V feel particularly unstable and unsteady on the road. It's best for adults over 155 cm (5 feet, 11 inches) in height. Children under this height will prefer conventional bicycles. I tested this out today and I had a blast. It's very smooth and comfortable and it's the perfect mode of transportation for a warm summer's day. It's a game changer. I can see it rapidly replacing cars, trams, trains and even planes in cities around the world. It will make cities much greener, healthier and more sustainable. It's a no brainer for the future. I hope the manufacturer takes note of the EN-V's shortcomings and fixes them. It will certainly sell a lot of bikes. 

Mike Rutherford: Telegraph Motoring's Mike Rutherford gave the EN-V a test drive. He didn't like what he saw.


Telegraph Motoring: There were a few issues. The wheels are really low and close together. This made the EN-V feel particularly unstable and unsteady on the road. 

"," With four wheels, the EN-V feels less like a motorcycle and more like a Segway on wheels. That's because you step on the frontwheel to go forwards, the backwheel to go backwards and you lean to balance.  

It worked a treat. There's certainly something about two wheels that makes you seem to go much faster.

When I was a child my mum used to take me to the seaside town of Blackpool and there's nothing quite like feeling the salt water rush over the rocks. I've also had some lovely rail journeys abroad. I went with my then two-year-old son on the Eurostar from London St Pancras International to Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. The journey was over three hours, but it felt like a minute because I was bouncing all the way. We returned a few weeks later on the French train service and we did the same ride in under an hour, which was amazing because we were traveling second class. My son is now 11 and I don't go on Eurostar anymore because it's too crowded, but I still love the France to London train service. - Andrea Thompson - Newsreader 5 celebrities Tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys.

I love to be able to get out of the city when I travel by train and this is really easy in France but more of a challenge in Italy. My favorite journey was when I got off the train in Florence and I was able to walk over the bridges of the old town straight into theDuomo. To be able to step into one of the most famous churches in the world and also be in the open air at the same time was just magical. I'm going to Florence in July for the Fiera di Firenze - a world-renowned trade fair. My favorite part has got to be the food: aperitivi and the piazza in front of the Duomo are two of my favorite places in the world. My next favorite memory was of my first train ride to Verona where I went to see the Arena in a friends window seat. The view from that window was one of the best I've ever seen but the noise from the other passengers and the rumble of the train made for a disorienting and anxious trip but it was also an incredible experience. I also love to travel by train when I can get some quiet time; to sit back and let my brain wander without interruption.

A Lauren Pope - Model My favourite memory on the railway was going to Henley Royal Spa when I was little. My dad took me there every year and every year it grew on me. When I got older I would ask him, 'but where's the steam trains?'. My dad explained that when the Thames Valley steam train was in retirement they brought in another from London. We would ride the steam train, and then go into the museum which had old steam engines. That was my favourite memory. My second favourite was when my mum took us to Windsor in her little train. When she would sit down you could tell she was excited too. My third was my second holiday where my family would take a train to Edinburgh. My family went to Doune in Perthshire, and my dad took us on the steam train. It's one of my proudest moments. A Olivia Colman - Actor Our family takes a train to Edinburgh very often - it's such a treat. We always sit in the little saloon car, and I love looking out of the windows to see the countryside passing by.

The train clatters to a halt and we disembark at Nice. It's a sunny day and I wear my brightest summer outfit. The landscape starts to feel familiar, as I wander around the old town and the narrow streets.
  
The Italian flag flies at the port, and the piazza is packed. I walk up to the old customs house and there's a queue of waiting passengers, all with sunhats and sun jackets. I feel very self-conscious, and remember a trip to Pisa where I struggled to find an empty window seat. I see Andrew and start to feel very thirsty. I wander into a café and order a soda. I notice a seat at the window and I can see the sea beyond the small harbour. 
  
I realise this is a perfect place to sit and watch the passing boats. I watch for some time. In my mind I can already hear Andrea Thompson - Newsreader - saying; 'Now the Italian Coast is approaching, we can see mountains in the distance'. She's right, as I stand at the window, I can see high snow covered mountains and feel my heart race.

There's a whole city underground, every building is painted white or beige and the streets are eerily"," I'm always too late and have to spend the night in a cheap hotel, but the next day we find a nice room and the scenery is magical. There are still the same pine trees and the same beach at Nice, but with the train you get out of breath in a flash.

" The answer is that it would likely become a city of insects due to the lack of food and other resources needed to maintain humans. It would also likely become a nuclear wasteland, as it lacks the people to manage the reactors. In another chapter, Weisman discusses the disappearance of humans from the planet, and projects out what our world would look like in 2050 without humans. He projects a world that has no humans at all, and no one is doing anything about it. Human-free worlds are described as being similar to the Moon, with no vegetation and animals moving about on the ground or in the water. The human population is not done evolving away, but has not yet disappeared completely. Some people are working on the problem of how to reverse the effects of humans on the planet, but the goal has not been achieved yet. The World Without Us was published in 2005.


A world without humans:  without humans at all, and no one is doing anything about it.  2050


Alan Weisman, the author of the best-selling The World Without Us, first asked this question in a TED Talk in 2004. His hypothesis turned out to be correct: The impact of humans on the planet has decreased over time due to the evolutionary progress of species that are not dependent on humans for survival, such as insects. However, human-free worlds are not devoid of resources. There is still food and water, and they are not expected to run out anytime","

Lessons
- Humans are part of how the planet works
- Humans are not the planet
- Humans affect the planet in big and small ways
- In the end the planet will continue on without us

The following are some strategies that would help humanize the planet:
- Weeds take over abandoned land
- People take on caretaker roles
- Land is taken over by nature
- Plants and animals take over urban spaces

While the book is certainly speculative, Weisman makes an excellent case for why our planet and its beings would be in better shape if humans didn't exist.


# The World Without Us


The Earth would be very lonely without humans. In 2023 a small group of humans, a few scientists and a few military personnel, makes a plan to ensure the survival of their species and the continuation of humanity. They hope to hide the planet's biosphere from the other organisms that inhabit the planet and to create new eco-systems that will sustain life.


The humans hide the planet in a virtual reality simulation and name the planet ""Arcadia"" (derived from the Greek word for ""happy land""). The planet is powered by solar batteries, which allow the simulation to run smoothly for six years. But even with the Arcadia simulation, the humans need the help of natural animals and plants to survive.


The humans go on a space mission on Mars.  This helps to spread the seeds of life"," With no humans to maintain and police the streets, the city would descend into chaos and become a veritable war zone. The city would quickly descend into lawlessness, with everything from guns and gangs to drug dealing and prostitution taking hold.  The lack of any one governing authority also allows for this lawlessness; criminals will control the streets with the least amount of policing to guarantee a steady supply of victims. Weisman posits that humanity would eventually reconstitute itself without the need for our presence on the planet. The question is, ""when will it happen?""

Use the following as your outline to your story:

Without humans to take care of the planet, New York would quickly become a lawless, chaotic city.  This would lead to anarchy and eventual reconstitution of the city without humans. When will this happen?

We will need:
A) A timeline of when humankind became a distinct species
B) An outline of how long it would take for the planet to recover after humans disappeared
C) Research on how a city would function if there were no humans to police and maintain it.

Use your understanding of B to inform your answer to A. The answer to A should be a rough timeline of when humanity first appeared on earth. Use this to frame your question B.

Next, use research on a city without humans to inform your answer to C. How would the city function without the humans to maintain and police it? This","

  1. There are two main ways of analyzing a hypothesis. One is by listing the assumptions or premises from which the conclusion is drawn. The other is by providing examples that relate the hypothesis to reality. In this case, Weisman lists out a few assumptions like that humankind is the sole creator of climate change, human beings can be considered a ""species"" that produces noticeable impact on the environment, and humans can be considered a ""species"" that can be extinct without much loss to the environment. Finally, Weisman provides a few examples of the effects of humans going extinct on the environment like the disappearance of the New York City Police Department, the disappearance of animals on the planet and the disappearance of plant species. Overall, Weisman's analysis of the hypothesis is provided on several assumptions and some examples relating the hypothesis to reality.

  2. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is a scale that grades the readability of English words and sentences. The scale runs from 0-100 and 0 is considered very difficult to read and 100 is considered very easy to read. Weisman's hypothesis is written on a sentence so we will not be able to grade it on this scale. But if we look at the example provided in the analysis part of the above paragraph, we see that the passage could be graded on the scale. Grades 40 and 60 are both close to 50 which is considered as a medium difficulty to read.

  3. There are a couple"," As a major city, its infrastructure would likely be designed for human habitation. It would likely have an economy which relies on tourism. It would probably still have a population, although small and isolated. Although most animals would likely die out, some species may persist. However, Weisman makes the point that there would likely be little or no human influence on the planet; there would not be humans to farm the land; and although animals could potentially be reintroduced, there would likely be few humans to look after the animals. The result of this is that many of Earth's most famous animals, such as elephants, polar bears and pandas, might likely be extinct by the year 2100. However, he argues that other species, such as blue whales and porpoises, would likely be able to survive even without humans. There would be an increase in biodiversity as species other than humans would be able to coexist with the planet. Weisman makes the point that while this may not seem like much, if any, of a concern, it is a fact of life. In the long term, life would probably continue on its own, but humans would likely no longer be influencing it. This is an excellent book to read with your learners before you proceed to the next topic. 
We live on a small portion of a rock in space orbiting a tiny blue-green planet approximately 11-12 miles in diameter. This tiny world supports one of the richest biosphere ecosystems in the universe"," The city government will still exist, although probably in a somewhat diminished state. Food production would continue and humans would take care of the rest of the animals, including dogs. However, many ecosystems would no longer be maintained as each animal would rely on its own species for food, protection, and care. The oceans would lose a third of their living creatures, birds and fish alone. This loss would cause changes in the chemical composition of seawater, changing the ocean's temperature, salt content, and the availability of food for marine life.


According to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scales, the text you've just read has a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 10, which is considered ""easy text.""


As the above text shows, humans appear in the text fewer than ten times, and the text is made up of sentences, words, and syllables less than 10, 20, and 10 respectively.


Based on this, it is safe to say that this is a Grade 2 text.


However, there are some key words in the text which we should take a closer look at. First is the word ""still,"" which is used once in the first sentence and only appears once again at the end of the book at the very end. It is often used to show that something is still the case even though it might not be immediately obvious. In this case, humans would still be around, but there is a substantial","

The World Without Us: The Story of our Future, published in 2007, is a popular book that has been reviewed by science news outlets such as the Washington Post and the Guardian, as well as mainstream media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, the BBC, and the New York Times. The book has also been the subject of numerous television and radio interviews.


The following passage is excerpted from the review in the Washington Post. Please note that the passage uses simplified expressions and abbreviations for geographical names.


Weisman, Alan. The World Without Us: The Story of our Future. New York: Doubleday, 2007.


The World Without Us is one of several books on the planet whose publication has been accelerated by the rise of digital media. In many ways, the book is a rewriting of the history of the 20th century, with the main narrative focusing on ""what would happen to our world if humans were suddenly gone"". In The World Without Us, Weisman examines how our cities, economies, infrastructure, science and technology, arts, and culture would endure. ""In a few years,"" he says, ""New York would look like Sydney after a cyclone. In my experience, few humans are capable of planning ahead that far.""

The World Without Us is not an academic book.  While Weisman has made the case that humans would continue to develop on their own, he has also taken issue"
" Our valley in the Western District was fortunate as it was a few miles away from the larger cities of Sydney and Wollongong which ensured that the storms could build and rage over a longer period of time. The storms were not only destructive but brought with it the risk of injury or even death. 
  A few weeks prior to the first big storm of the year, I was in the kitchen chopping vegetables for a meal when I caught sight of something on the porch that hadn’t been there earlier in the evening. I crept quietly through the house, opened the back door and peered out into the night. The storm was raging and the wind was howling through the valley. I watched in a mixture of fear and trepidation as the branches and power lines began to sway violently back and forth. I wondered what would become of our farmhouse and what our farm might look like come morning. I was relieved when I turned to look up at the sky and saw a small dark cloud moving steadily closer to the valley. It was then I saw it; a small flickering glow in the distance. 
  After what seemed like a lifetime, the dark cloud reached the valley. It was here that I first began to worry. There was no escaping the dark cloud; not even by going inside. I could feel the fear slowly rising in me as I watched the flickering light move closer and closer to the farmhouse. It was then that I saw it.

The flick"," While the valley dwellers may have started to feel the pangs of winter by then, it could not save them as the heavy snowstorms and extreme cold were waiting in ambush. 
     
My sister and I were the first to sense the danger coming early that year in the form of an incoming storm. We had seen many storms during the months we had been in the hills but we never imagined they could be so dangerous and violent. The storm that arrived at night had ripped through the nearby hills in a matter of minutes and swept across the valley, bringing torrential rains and ferocious winds. 
     
My sister and I had taken refuge in the outhouse after the toilet had been pummeled by the winds. We had spent the night huddling together trying to survive the cold as much as the intense winds. We didn’t even know it but a storm had passed through the day before and it had brought many animals with it. It was a small mercy that it had kept them out of the outhouse and away from us as the wind had been blowing so ferociously that it had almost forced us to open the door for fresh air. 
     
The next morning we realised our mistake when we opened the door to get some fresh air but not before we got drenched in the intense downpour that greeted us. We had also been wondering if the animals had made it through the storm and into the valley but we"," 

There was a strong wind from the north, howling through the trees. We were up early that morning, checking and rechecking the safety of the valley. Our family had gathered close together, trying to stay warm. Our animals were safe in their small village, tucked away in the valley. We were feeling a little isolated, like we had drifted a little too far from the village. 

But we were determined to stay together and save what we could of our community. The first threat that we realised was the lack of water. We had planned to bring as much water from the spring high in the hills, but that had all been spoiled by the storm. 

That afternoon the storm worsened, the wind picked up and more trees were knocked down. We could see the valley walls were being eaten away by the wind and the rising waters. Soon it would be over our heads. 

I asked my sister, “should we leave?” My sister was always the one to look out for us, even at a young age. She was a leader of our community and an inspiration to us all. She looked at the rising waters, feeling a mix of anger and fear. Her voice was calm when she spoke. “we have a way out. Follow me”. 

I ran to join her, trying to keep up with my little sister as we jumped over the last wall of the village. We took off for the hills, our feet kicking up a"," In that year, our valley was completely ravaged by the most ferocious of storms which completely annihilated everything in its path destroying most structures, completely destroying our own community. We lost everything, including most of our children, grandchildren and friends. 
  However, when the time came for me to decide whom to entrust with the task of rebuilding our family, I knew who to entrust it with, no one else. My daughter, she who was born right in our own vale, who grew up and graduated from our own high school, she the one who should have been the one who carried on the legacy of our family, she alone could have done it because of her unequalled strength of will and ability to endure. 
  Now that she is grown and graduated she still lives in our very same valley but now, she has changed and is not the same person she was then. She has matured and learnt so much from her experiences. And the reason is simple: she did not want to rebuild our family but instead, sought to annihilate it, just like the storms that had annihilated everything in its path, she decided to take the risk of building a new family in a new place, a place that would surely guarantee her a never ending supply of funds that would allow her to live the life she chooses, however she chooses it. 
  And this is a testament to the strength of will and ability of women who build their families.


Fles"," That year, the valley we live in was actually called “Death Valley” for obvious reasons. And this was not something that only happened in the winter months. It could happen anytime of the year, at any time of the day or night, even in the brightest of sunshine days. My wife and I were busy with our newborn son when we first heard a rumble in the distance and the wind suddenly became strong. We got our son dressed and ready to run out of the house in case the winds turn worse. But the winds didn’t die down. The rumbles in the distance became louder. We quickly realised that the hills behind our house could actually be torn and shake. We packed our bags and rushed out to the balcony. To our disbelief, our house was actually moving, swaying and moving away from the wind. It had actually been turned into an ocean and my wife and I were already feeling the tides sweeping us away. We saw the same thing happen to our neighbours. Their houses began to topple one after the other. We saw our friends’ houses get blown off the hills and we were helplessly watching it from our balcony. It was getting dark by then and the winds were strong now. My wife and I could feel the rumbling in our stomachs because we realised that the storm was finally upon us. Just then, our new found friend and neighbor called our names and asked us to go and grab our belongings. I tried explaining to him that we"," 

The valley was completely cut off from the outside world. The few supplies of food and water were stored away in secret places, but it was always far too soon before the next wave of storms and rain set in, and again, we were cut off from our friends and families.

But this time was different.  This time I heard the rumble of thunder and looked up into the darkening sky, my eyes wide with fright. The air was electric. I could feel the tension in the atmosphere and could feel the earth tremble beneath my feet. I looked towards the nearby hills, and saw a thick pall of grey cloud hanging low over the hills. It had been unseasonably cold that winter, with frequent snowstorms and periods of sub zero temperatures that would quickly turn to torrential rain, and this just added to the pressure. 

The rumbling storm front was moving towards us, sweeping across the sky like some giant serpent in its path. It made no sense to us then, but looking out into the distance, we saw an unnatural glow. The sun was no longer visible through the murk. It was as if the whole sky had been blackened and the remaining sun no longer bright enough for me to look upon. 

As the storm moved closer, we knew that we were in trouble. Thick, grey clouds quickly covered the sun, turning the sky a gloomy shade of blue. The air grew colder. Thunder began to"," We thought it was a little rain. My daughter and son in law, both retired army men, said we would be fine. We knew about the severe weather pattern in those hills and we kept an eye out for any changes in the weather report every morning and evening. They were quite used to the rain. They kept themselves busy with their daily activities. We were expecting some flooding and perhaps even landslides. However, when the rain had stopped, and the wind had died down, we knew that something more than just rain had come. The hills surrounding us had been rumbling as if they had stored up for months any amount of rain, and it was going to be a big release, perhaps the biggest in many years. The valley we lived in was completely cut off from the outside world. We had no neighbors, no friends and no way of knowing what was happening. The electricity had gone off at 6am. At 8 we started to get messages through a small antennae on the roof of the house, but we were cut off again after about ten minutes. It was 10 when someone finally called up on the mobile network and we could talk. The mobile phone had run out of battery. There was no way to recharge it that we knew of. We were totally cut off and without electricity. It was around 1 in the afternoon when we realized that the surrounding hills were moving and that we were in serious danger.

" Seymour was surprised to see her and his wife, Ruth, and son, Jerry, were in a state of mild fright.
Miss Cohen asked to speak to Seymour alone and when he had dismissed Ruth and Jerry he ushered her into the study. ""You're Seymour's son Jerry?"" she said. ""I know your name is Jerry but what's your real name? You look younger than you are and you've got more than most do for your age."" Jerry looked uncomfortable. ""I try to be careful,"" he said, though he sounded unhappy about it.
""Well, you look about 17, so I'm going to call you Jerry Jr, which is what all the adults call me. Jerry Sr is my brother. When I was younger I took after my father and looked more like him than my mother so I was called Rita instead of Marie. Now I'm taking after my mother and looking more like me than my father so I'm going to have to call myself Rita Cohen Jr. Are you going to help me or stone me?""
Seymour was surprised. Jerry was usually very compliant, but now he looked worried. He had a nervous mannerism that he had learned from his mother that made it hard for him to avoid looking worried. He was afraid that whatever was going to happen to him would also happen to his friends.
""I'd love to help you Rita Cohen Jr but I'm afraid I can't do that,"""," Seymour was surprised to see her and asked her in. They sat down and had a chat. At one point Rita said that it had been a long time since she had last seen him so they had decided to call in a guest. Seymour said he would like that, but wasn't expecting any trouble. ""Trouble is my stock-in-trade Rita, so I thought we might as well have a chat"". 

The trouble started once Rita had sat down. From that moment on Seymour could feel the air leave the room as she started telling him why she had come to visit. At first he tried to convince her that she was making a big mistake by coming to see him so she could say goodbye, but she wouldn't have that, she said. She claimed she had heard wonderful things about the job the boss had Seymour doing and that now was the time to make the move. She showed him a letter and said:

""You know boss, I have lived my entire life in London and have never stepped into a country where the language was so different from my own. I have always dreamed of coming to America, but I need to do a little something to make sure I have the means to get myself established. When I read this letter you put in my hands I knew I had to come and tell you. Please forgive me for the deception. I wish you the best of luck and hope to see you soon.""

"," She announced that she needed a home for her family of five. Seymour was touched by the gesture and agreed to let her stay in the barn where he kept his milk truck. He told her she could stay with him until she could afford a house.  

* * *

Marie was proud of Seymour's daughter who had come to them with a challenge. She asked what Seymour intended to do.  

""I'm going to move us from our small apartment to a bigger house on the next street.  I'll need someone to take care of the five of you so we'll have a proper place.""

""Of course,"" she agreed, ""It's a good idea. I'll put out the feelers and see if anyone is interested in taking in the Cohen family."" 

Rita arrived a few days later and the six of them moved into the big house. There was plenty of room for everyone.  

Marie took a shine to the girl and invited her to the family dinner table. They worked together and made a plan to renovate the house and add on to it. 

Seymour was very proud of his daughter and was a little embarrassed by the attention his little girl was getting.

Marie often referred to Rita as 'Seymour's girl' and was very fond of her.

'What about?' asked Seymour warily
'Just talk to me!'
Seymour pondered this for a minute then said 'Come into the kitchen. I'll make us some coffee.'
Miss Cohen scuttled in huddling against the smell of grease. She pointed to the shiny black stove and said in a husky, deep voice 'My father says you have a big problem. He says you are losing money every day.'
'What does he want?' asked Seymour, puzzled, as he poured coffee.
'He wants you to call him!'
'Well, there is no phone in this house.'
'He says you can come home tonight and we can discuss this.'
Seymour poured two cups of coffee and asked Miss Cohen, 'What is it you want?'
Miss Cohen held up three fingers.
'All right! Three hundred dollars in small bills, right here.'
'And if I don't give you three hundred dollars?' said Seymour warily.
'Then I will come home tonight and I'll take my father with me and I will kick your door in and I'll break your windows. Your wife will wake up to this terrible noise and see my father standing over her and she will scream for the police.'
Seymour and his wife were petrified.
'That's an"," Seymour was glad to see her but worried that she would disturb the peace and quiet of his afternoon nap. He had a suspicion that the woman had probably been sent by his daughter Marie in an effort to keep him company. However, Miss Cohen quickly set about breaking open one of the few items of household furniture that Seymour possessed - his piano. She started by tuning the piano, then sitting down and strumming the keys so she could demonstrate her ability to play several tunes on various pieces of sheet music that she produced from a drawer. It wasn't long before Seymour was enjoying his afternoon nap in peace again. Miss Cohen must have been gone for a few hours - perhaps shopping for food, or else she had decided to visit the library in the nearby town of Greenwich. When she returned she was carrying a large platter with enough food to feed the entire household. Seymour was so surprised that he couldn't help but ask her what she had been up to. Miss Cohen replied that she had gone to the nearest library and borrowed books on the piano. She said that she then had a go at practising her newly learnt pieces of music in the privacy of her own home. She even managed a few short pieces of her own composition! Seymour was overjoyed and could hardly contain his excitement at the news that Miss Cohen had learnt to play the piano, something he had always assumed to be an absolute impossibility. However, Miss Cohen could hardly","

""Hello Seymour,"" she said brightly.

""Oh Rita!"" Seymour blurted out.  ""I thought you'd never get here.""

""The bus only goes twice a week, you know."" Rita sighed.

Seymour sighed in agreement.  ""And you're not at the beauty shop,"" he added.

""I got fired,"" said Rita. ""They found I haven't been able to cut hair for two weeks now.""

Seymour nodded sympathetically. ""What a shame. You could have been a barber.""

Rita shook her head. ""Too dangerous,"" she said.

Seymour nodded. ""But you've never been very good with a scissors either.""

""No,"" agreed Rita, looking somewhat crestfallen.

""You've got to be careful in the world of crime,"" Seymour warned her.

""I know, Seymour,"" agreed Rita.  ""But the money's better than what I used to make at the barber shop.""

""We could make more money working at the docks,"" Seymour pointed out. ""People are desperate for a good tailor - and we could use the profits to invest in the shop too.""

Rita was listening intently. ""I'd like to think about it,"" she said. ""You know, the world of crime"," 

""Hiya kiddo, how'd ya get on at school?"" Mr Coates asked, sitting down on his creaky wicker settee.

""Oh, not bad, not bad,"" Miss Cohen replied. ""Not too bad at all actually. In fact, I'd say my marks were about average. I got 80 per cent across the board which is pretty good when you take into account the short time I studied.""

Mr Coates raised an eyebrow. ""Short time, short time,"" he said. ""How come?""

""Oh, well the teachers here were a bit hard on us actually,"" Miss Cohen replied, reaching into her overalls and drawing out a wad of crumpled leaves and twigs. She blew on them to produce enough smoke to puff and cackle. ""Let's just say one of them tried to tell me about the time I got a 'D' for writing a story about the time Tintin was sent to Dartmoor... and that was some three years ago now. So I thought I'd better get all the facts right before coming to see ya'. Ya' know.""

Mr Coates considered this for a moment. ""So you came to see me because of the marks?"" he said finally.

""Well no, not exactly. Well, yes, I suppose so,"" Miss Cohen replied. She pulled a face. ""I don't know. I just wanted"

" It is important to understand that the more you challenge your child, the more their talent will develop. And equally, that challenging them too much can have the opposite effect. Tapping into their musical aptitude requires a balance. Allow them to show you what they can do well, and support and encourage them to improve upon their current level of ability. This will enable them to play what they love and develop the ability to make music as a creative pursuit. In order to provide the necessary support and encouragement, it helps to know what they are good at and what you, as a parent or teacher, would like to see them improve upon. For example, if your child is good at playing the piano, ask them to play the opening notes of the Beethoven Sonata or an easier piece such as Chopsticks. If your child is a very good cellist, ask them to play something from the cello concerto, and so on.

SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS It is important to understand that the more you challenge your child, the more their talent will develop. And equally, that challenging them too much can have the opposite effect. Tapping into their musical aptitude requires a balance. Allow them to show you what they can do well, and support and encourage them to improve upon their current level of ability. This will enable them to play what they love and develop the ability to make music as"," You may think they are a handful but it's their gift that you should appreciate.

Your prompt should start by giving some context to this question - for example, it could explain that some specialist music schools face a challenge in responding to pupils who have shown outstanding musical ability. This includes schools that focus on gifted students and those that are enriched or mainstream, and you should briefly explain why this is a challenge.

You then need to describe one challenging situation you’ve experienced with a gifted child. Try to be as specific as possible, for example: “One time our child started a practice song with the wrong tempo and her expression was a mix of frustration, sadness, and concentration – it was a difficult conversation to have. But we tried to stay calm and let her know our expectations and we got her down the next day with no further problems.”

The final section of the story is the key: the one piece of advice you have for other schools trying to deal with a gifted student. You could end the story by saying something like, “We learnt that it helps to have a clear vision of how we want them to reach their potential and how we can support them in achieving it. Our school has a well-developed strategy for working with and developing gifted children, which we think is helping our child to flourish!”


If you like this prompt, try asking others to read your articles. You could share the article on social media or encourage your teacher to print it","  

Parents and carers should understand that there are two sides to every child. One side to the story is the child's innate musical ability. This can be very noticeable at a very early age, perhaps even before a year old.  

Parents/carers should never underestimate their child's ability and recognise that it can be developed and nurtured. Music develops skills such as rhythm, pitch and rhythm all of which can be encouraged, nurtured and developed with specific tuition and rehearsal time. 

When a child's musical talent is noticed, special classes are often offered in their local area.  In these classes, parents are given regular updates of their child's progress, so that they can witness the positive change in their child. Parents are encouraged to join in with the classes and give their child positive reinforcement for the positive behaviour. 

For example, singing and dancing in the class may lead to praise from the teacher and other children, for the positive behaviour. This positive reinforcement of their child's behaviour helps in building their self-confidence.

Specialist schools often also offer parents help, advice and access to additional resources for developing your child's musical talent.

You should help the parent to recognise their child's special talent and find ways to provide the child with the rewards and encouragement they need. You can do this by:

Encouraging the child to develop their talent - Many children show special talent when they are young. You can help the child find a passion for music and encourage them to play an instrument, practice their instrument or play in a music group. They may be worried about whether they are good enough or not good enough, or about disappointing their parents. Providing a safe space for the child to develop their talent can let them know that they are loved and valued and can help them focus on their goal.

Paying attention to the parent's reactions - If the parent is overwhelmed or frustrated, you can help them by listening, asking open-ended questions about their experiences. This can help the parent to gain confidence and build their understanding of how to respond to their child's special talent.

Encouraging the family to join the special school - If the parent cannot support their child's musical development, you can suggest to the family that they contact the special school for gifted students to see if they can find a space for their child.

About Emma:

Emma has worked in Special Education for 10 years and has taught in both KS1"," To help you manage this, here are some tips. Remember that each child is an individual with a different profile and learning needs.  

Firstly, you must recognise their ability. There's no point in trying to talk them out of it. Ask them to show you what they can do and be prepared to be impressed by their abilities. 
Secondly, think about why they show this ability. Do they have a lot of practice?  Have they had a lot of encouragement? Could they be taking the music more seriously than you are? Do they have a particularly strong teacher? 
Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, don't over-focus on their ability.  Encourage them to play other things too. Allow them to develop an interest in music in a way that's right for them. You may not ever see the talent in some children! 
And finally, be patient.  It could be years before you see the full benefit of their ability.

Children who show outstanding musical ability can be exciting, and parents may sometimes fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. To help you manage this, here are some tips.

Firstly, you must recognise their ability. There's no point in trying to talk them out of it. Ask them to show you what they can do and be prepared to be impressed by their abilities.

Secondly, think about why"," 
Firstly,  it's important to distinguish between an exceptional performance and the child's true level of ability. The latter is often harder to gauge and requires more careful observation and assessment.
Some children develop an exceptional ability during the course of their schooling. This can often lead to an inflated perception of their own abilities by parents, teachers, and others. It is important to not set unrealistic expectations. 
Acknowledge their achievements, of course. But also recognise their true potential, and their own ability to reach it. Encourage them to take on challenging and exciting new experiences, to practise and to continue to focus on developing their craft and potential through study.
It's also important to be patient with them and to recognise their strengths and interests too. Encourage their passions, and reward them when they successfully pursue them.
Encouragement and positive reinforcement can often help to prevent the onset of difficult and uncooperative behaviour, and help to smooth any rough spots. Behavioural modification and training should also be considered, and these can often be effective in modifying challenging and unhelpful behaviours.

"," 

Here are some suggestions:
 - Keep an open mind and seek to understand their interests. 
- Don't attempt to replicate your own musical abilities - it's important for children to have an element of self-discipline. 
- Don't take their performance at face value - sometimes gifted children may take an interest in music simply to entertain or impress. 

Rather, celebrate their ability and find creative ways to share their joy with them.

THE STRANGE but True Story of an Insurance Agent who closed his City Office and went sheep farming  

A new life? Sounds like a movie plot, but it's a true story of an insurance agent who closed his City office and went sheep farming.   

The Farmer Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. So last year I closed the business and moved my family to a small village in the Cotswolds. I was looking for a change - but now I'm loving it! I love"," I was burnt out and needed a change of scenery. Also, we received an insurance payout which made me decide to take the leap of faith and move my family to the Cotswolds.' 

The Cotswolds is a quaint little town that sits quietly by the Thames in the West of England. With many picturesque villages and ancient castles it is a beautiful place to live and a fantastic place to raise sheep. 

On his new farm he has six ewes and his first lamb crop has just been born. 'The lambs are adorable' comments his wife 'and very strong. We hope to sell some of them.' 

Matt's daughter is a school teacher and understands the importance of reading at an early age so he has written the following passage on the farm's sheep blog:

Matt's daughter is a school teacher and understands the importance of reading at an early age so he has written the following passage on the farm's sheep blog: 

Matt Froggatt"," As a child I once had a bike that would go ""beep, beep, beep, whoompf"" as I peddled along the coast road. This could have been a dream. It was only when I reached the farm and found I had no phone, no email and that nobody in the City had bothered to tell me that I had a sheep farm, that I began to suspect that this was no longer a dream but a waking nightmare. But in my nightmare I had one small advantage - I had the farm and all the tools and resources with which to get back on my feet. It was a humbling experience but ultimately liberating. After the first month I took on a customer of the City's insurance division, who was impressed that I had kept his house in a condition where he could get to it. As the months passed, I took on more and more customers of the City's insurance division, as well as customers from my previous business - small businesses, private individuals and organisations. My only regret from this new life is that I didn't take on a few more sheep.'

  * You could start your story with 'After 14 years in business I found that...' but as the story develops you should also mention the following: the City of London is the largest financial centre in the world and is responsible for the UK legal and regulatory system, the UK stock exchange, the City Code of Conduct, and the London Stock Exchange Group; the City is surrounded"," I could not afford to keep running my car and there were just too many distractions. I decided that I wanted to try something new so I came up with a farm idea. I researched the area and found a nice sized sheep farm in the area that I thought had scope to expand. I contacted the owner of the farm and showed him my idea to combine work and play. He has since said that he would like to offer me the farm on a trial basis for 2 years - to see if we both are still enjoying what we are doing. '

Here is the story read by Lucy Adam: 
The farmer Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. I could not afford to keep running my car and there were just too many distractions. I decided that I wanted to try something new so I came up with a farm idea. I researched the area and found a nice sized sheep farm in the area that I thought had scope to expand. I contacted the owner of the farm and showed him my idea to combine"," So I decided to do something different and set off for the wilds of West Wales where, in my mind, the fresh air and excitement of the countryside would restore my soul. It was here I set up my own farm, but the task was by no means simple - it's not easy living in the wilds of the rural west of Wales and every week I'd receive phone calls from City colleagues who were worried about their insurance policies. It soon became apparent that I was the odd one out however, as I actually quite like living in the city. So, what's a farmer to do? Well, luckily I have a knack for maths, and as I spend my days dealing with sheep, I decided that I should put my maths ability to use, and applied for a grant from my insurance company to study for my CEFR level D level. And lo and behold, not only was I successful, but the insurance company also awarded me the grant to help me complete my studies, and ultimately achieve my goal of going back to the City of London to work in insurance. It's fair to say that, after 14 years away, I've come home - or, at least, the countryside has. '

After 14 years in business I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. So I decided to do something different"
" Letter writing offers an alternative way to feel. Here is a space to jot down your thoughts and feelings about letter writing.

Do you still write letters?

How do you receive them?

Do you enjoy the content?

Do you worry that you might have less chance of meeting new people this way?

Has letter writing gone out of fashion?

Are there other more efficient ways to communicate your thoughts and feelings?

Your experiences would be interesting to other readers

The story you write can be short or long, sent in the form of an email or as part of an article.

Here is the first paragraph for you to write: 

My old friend Mr. X is coming to town. We have not seen each other for years but his letter gave me a jolt of excitement when it arrived. I haven't heard from Mr. X in a while, it has been years since we last corresponded but when I opened the letter today, my heart nearly jumped out of my chest. 

I tear open the envelope to reveal an air mail stamp from Singapore, a piece of paper written on, with some sloppy handwritten lettering that reads:

Dear Ms. A,

The last time we communicated was many years ago and life has moved on since then, but my dear friend Ms. A, who also happens to be my neighbor, brought the letter to my attention, and I hope you enjoy this"," 

A letter can be a physical object that you hold in your hand and from which you can feel its soft texture, smell the ink and feel the weight of the paper. A letter can contain an image that can be closely examined as you unfold the envelope. It can hold an audiobook or video message. A letter can contain a downloadable file of your favourite song or poem. It can contain a digital image that you can zoom in and zoom out to examine in great detail. 

A letter can also communicate a great deal about the sender. When I opened this envelope there was a letter for me from my son which began 'Dad, I hope you are well.' His greeting and words give me hope that he is looking after himself and also reassure me that he is happy at home. I can see from his return address that the postmark is from Singapore and as you can tell from the seal on the envelope it came through the UK Post Office. 

In short a letter has a physicality and a richness of experience that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. I hope to continue to receive as many as I can for as long as I live.

We were all living out our lives, enjoying them thoroughly, when one day Olivia said she wanted to try something a bit different. 

""I'm not sure what to do first"" she said. ""I can think of quite a few things I've always wanted to do, but never got round to doing them, because I assumed I'd never be able to actually do it!"" 

We all laughed, Olivia was very passionate about what she wanted to do. 

""Let's swap lives!"" she exclaimed. ""Simon and I will swap lives for a day, you Jane and Sam can swap, and I'll swap with Olivia!"" 

We all agreed.

A little boy lives in his beautiful home surrounded by his loving family. One day, his parents and brother decide to surprise him by taking his little sister on a special trip to the beach. Little does he know, he is going to spend the day trapped in the body of his little sister. 

He doesn't know where he comes from, who his family are, or what he is doing there. He is just happy to be with his family and sister again. 

He learns so much about his family and about himself. It turns out he has a big family, and he is loved by everyone. He realizes he can be loved as himself instead of as the person he is born with, and he feels so safe and loved that he does not want to go home. 

It is a very happy day, and the little boy comes to think of it, he does not want to go home. The little sister does, though, and she runs downstairs to tell her parents. They get a phone, and they call the young boy's family, who rush over to the beach with the little boy. They put him in a wheelchair and take him to a hospital. 

He had a mild stroke, and they are very happy to have him back in his body. His parents and brother spend many hours with him the day after, asking questions and trying to understand what had happened to him. He learns that it was not so bad - he can see","  

\-- ""Eat, Drink & Be Merry"" - Christmas Story

Four strangers find themselves the recipient of a mysterious letter that grants them the opportunity to change their fate for a day. The letter is sent under the guise of a food-distribution agency and promises each of the recipients a free holiday to Italy - but only if they are willing to endure one day of forced fasting and public ridicule. Fortunately for the quartet, the letter's author, a hermit named George, has also chosen to test his theory that a person's true nature can be revealed through their eating habits. 

With much trepidation the volunteers undergo a series of dietary tests, enduring painful force-feeding regimens to test their gullibility. The results are disappointing: one volunteer succumbs to the pressure and attacks another in the cafeteria. When the group convenes later to watch the feed live on TV, it is clear that their sacrifice has backfired - not a single recipient has succumbed to their demands. A relieved George, who has also eaten a full meal, emerges from his booth to deliver the good news that the holiday has been cancelled and that he will be compensated for his troubles. The remaining volunteers are understandably disappointed, but are nevertheless grateful that George was willing to put his reputation on the line to try and save their holiday. 

One year later four individuals are standing in the streets of Rome with a fresh holiday under their belts","

  The following are two stories that would be appropriate for Grade 2 learners in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale:

  * A girl who hated going to school became a fireman for a day to swap lives with someone who loves going to school but never had the chance.
  * A boy who always wanted to be a fireman had a change of heart and went to school instead.

  Once the story is finished, ask the learners to consider whether the story was realistic and whether it would be a good idea or not to swap lives for a day.

  The following are some key words that could be used to describe the story:

  * Readable
  * Realistic
  * Swap lives
  * Good idea

  Ask the learners to share their views on the story.

  * It was certainly a good idea to swap lives for a day. You need to try new things in life and it could be quite exciting as well.
  * I think it's a good idea to swap lives once in a while, but not for a day. There's only one life and we should focus on the things that we like doing.

The following are some recommended editing techniques to help ensure the story is accessible to all:

* Reduce the use of complex sentence structures, and repeated words, to improve clarity and readability.
* Use more simple sentence structures to achieve a similar meaning.
* Avoid jargon, especially scientific jargon, to make the story easier to understand for A2 learners.
* Use sentences that include action words (e.g. ""went"") to make the story more engaging.

Finally, the following are a few characteristics that indicate a story is for learners in the A2 level or below:

* The text is not written in English.
* The text does not use proper nouns or words that are commonly used by A2 learners, such as slang words or technical jargon.
* The text includes a lack of words that A2 learners are able to understand (e.g. ""swapping lives with someone else"").
* The text is not longer than 1000 words.

""Once upon a time, there was a boy called Robert who had three sisters: Charlotte, Dorothy and May. And the three sisters each had a brother called Charles. So Robert, his sisters and his brother all lived under the same roof and were united by family ties. 
One day, Robert's sister May suggested that they should all swap lives with someone else for a day, and of course Robert thought it was a great idea. And so he wrote out a contract and each of the four signatories sealed their contract with a toothache. 

When the day arrived, the four of them swapped lives with the clock tower. And what a day it was! The people of Prague were delighted to see the return of the famous clock tower. Robert, his sisters and his brother returned home to their former selves, and also to the family they were so desperately missing. 
Robert and his sisters looked at their hands. One hand was that of Robert, one was that of Robert's sister Charlotte, and one hand was that of Robert's brother Charles. Robert and his sister Charlotte were happy to see their brother. But then Robert's brother Charles also found himself looking at his hand, and this was very strange indeed. It was not at all like before when his two hands held his sister's. And then he looked up and saw the clock tower and his mouth fell open in surprise. 

Robert's sister Charlotte asked: 'What's wrong, brother","

One day, a team of researchers set out to study the mysterious phenomenon of second sight. They recruited 16 volunteers to undergo extensive psychological tests. As it turns out, many of them possessed unusual abilities, such as the ability to predict events before they occur or to find objects that had been lost for many years. 

When the day of the study came, the 16 volunteers were divided into four groups of four people. Each group was asked to perform different activities, such as painting a picture or fixing a bicycle, while the fourth group was kept as controls, doing nothing at all.

What happened next was truly amazing. While the four groups worked in total silence, one by one, volunteers from the first and second groups started yelling from another world: ""It's me! It's me! They are giving me the wrong test results!"" The third group was also unaffected, showing no signs of the switch.

The last person to wake up could be heard screaming ""They killed the wrong person, they killed the wrong person!"" But nobody could believe their eyes. They had, in fact, killed the wrong person! It was the fourth group of volunteers, the control group, who committed the shocking crime: they killed a healthy volunteer who had never undergone the test. 

As the shockwave began to subside, all the volunteers tried to understand what had happened and why. To their amazement, they realized that they had not only been given different tests, but"
" I then draw a small circle around my chosen subject and state that she is my current work of personal interest. If they ask who I think should win the Nobel prize I say: she should. My friends and I disagree as to who she is, with one of them arguing that she is one of those British women who didn't make it in the 1940s who should be proud of their achievement. But my answer is simple: she is the scientist who won the Nobel prize in 1957 for her work on nuclear magnetism.

Which of the following could be the scientist who won the Nobel prize in 1957? 

-  Georgina Ferry
-  Dorothy Hodgkin
-  Hannah Bond Ellis
-  Iris Murdoch
-  Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin
-  Marie Curie
-  Marie Skłodowska Curie

-  Wilhelm Wien
-  Wilhelm Wien
-  William Henry Perkin
-  Wilhelm Wien
-  Winston Churchill
-  Winston Churchill
-  Winston Churchill
-  Winston"," If they still don't know who she is - and I have yet to find anyone who does not know who she is - I will then tell them that she is the only British woman scientist to have won the Nobel prize. You may assume that most people will know who Dorothy Hodgkin is. You might even know that she was awarded the Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1949. But if you don't know who she is then this test is unlikely to work.

A biographer is someone who writes the story of a person and Georgina Ferry is one such biographer. Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won the Nobel Prize. Georgina Ferry decided to write the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin who she was and how she became a world renowned scientist.

Georgina Ferry's story is readable by Grade 2 learners. It's unlikely that most people would know who Dorothy Hodgkin is. If someone doesn't know who she is, Georgina Ferry will tell them she is the only British woman scientist to have won the Nobel Prize. And that's why I decided to subject the people I was talking to to a Dorothy Hodgkin test. By telling them what I was writing about, I made them aware that they did not know who she was either. And since they did know who she was I was able to make them think harder about it and remember.

In conclusion, Georgina Ferry"," If they still do not know who she is I ask them to Google her.  They know who she is. They are wrong.  For anyone. To have such a well-known name belongs to only a tiny elite - to those whose lives are formed by a combination of privilege, family connections, and hard work. But Dorothy Hodgkin was born a peasant in a small English village and grew up with nothing. She worked hard at school and at Cambridge University - where her first choice was the law - to earn the right to go to the women's ward at London's King's College Hospital and complete a medical training that was all but denied to women at the time. She worked hard again after the war, running her own medical practice and devoting many hours a week to research. In the 1950s she joined the atomic research lab at Harwell, making new discoveries about the properties of atomic nuclei that helped drive the development of the nuclear family of bombs that brought the world such terrible suffering. When she found out what she had done she felt she had betrayed her profession. This is the story of a remarkable and lonely woman and the Dorothy Hodgkin who emerges from it. Dorothy Hodgkin:  The scientist who should be in the conversation belongs here. She was born in Chesterfield, South West England in 1909. Her father was a physician, and one of three children.  The family moved to a smaller place called Chesterton when Dorothy was just seven, but she"," As soon as they tell me they know someone famous who was born the same year as Dorothy Hodgkin or even a few years later than her I take out my phone and press the ""send"" key. If they say ""Oooh, I know that person"" I know that they are lying. If they say ""Wow, she's such a great woman"" or ""That's an amazing career achievement, she must be so proud"" or ""That is so cool, I never heard of her"" I'm getting closer. If they say ""I've never heard of her"" then I know I've got Dorothy Hodgkin written all over me and we are in business. She has very few followers on social media and she's not on Wikipedia so I'll just send her an email and see what she says. After I send her the email and explain that I'm writing a biography of her and I'd like to interview her I wait and watch. She will eventually reply and we set up a time to meet. If she agrees to the meeting then I know she is a Dorothy Hodgkin fan, but there is always a chance that she will turn up and be too busy to interview me so I'm having to be really persistent and sweet. And when that doesn't work I'm getting frustrated and thinking ""what the hell is she doing?!"" but then I realise I could just be unlucky and she may just be a tough nut to crack!

Examples"," If they recognize my voice or think to themselves ""now that's Interesting"" then they are likely to respond positively to the subsequent question ""Can Dorothy Hodgkin confirm this?"" If they say ""yes"" and then go on to say ""Well done"" then I know that they are on the road to enjoying a deeper understanding of science. But if they say ""no"" then we will never know. For all I know they could be secretly working on the Black Death. So the question is who is Dorothy Hodgkin and why are so few people aware of her achievements?

Dorothy Hodgkin is a woman scientist who won the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1937 for her research in the field of the membrane theory of excitation. The membrane theory, also referred to as Hodgkin and Huxley's theory or the biophysical theory of excitation, explains how nerve cells, muscle cells and other excitable cell types convert electrical stimuli into biochemical signals. The theory was formulated in the 1930s. Hodgkin and Huxley conducted their groundbreaking research at the Cavendish laboratory at the University of Cambridge.


Hodgkin received her medical degree from King's College London and became a demonstrator in histology at University College London in 1931. There she met William Bland, who was working on the biology of plants at the same time. When Hodgkin's husband was sent to the army, she joined him, and Bland invited her"," They say 'who?', stare at me blankly and mutter something like '...a scientist?' and walk away. No wonder - although she is a Nobel laureate, she is a biochemist; they don't have a lot of women in biochemistry. When I tell people that I am writing her biography I get stares and mutters of 'who?', but no questions. When I tell them that she is a Nobel laureate, there is a burst of enthusiasm and questions about what I am working on. In contrast, Georgina Ferry says that ""Dorothy Hodgkin should be a household name in her own country"". I suspect that her statement is a case of the gender-blind approach: Dorothy Hodgkin is a scientist, she is therefore a scientist. We all know that men are scientists too. 

If you need inspiration for your story, here are some examples: The Queen of Sheba by H. A. Rey, A. D. Gordon. A Life of George Stephenson by Andrew Reed, Elizabeth Garrett and William R. Pyne. 

The story you write here should have between 15 and 30 words per sentence with between 4 and 6 sentences per page.

From the above text, the Grade Level of this text is around 90,"," If they are surprised to hear of her they are given a card on which is printed the phrase ""Dorothy who?"". If they are still unsure I ask them the same question. If they still don't recognize her they are shown a picture of a younger looking Hodgkin and asked to recognize her. If they do not recognize her they are given some more reading material on her. It is surprising what a difference this simple test makes to people's understanding of women scientists.  

The Dorothy Hodgkin test (which is also known as the Who am I? test) is a card game where players assume the role of a famous scientist and the researcher tries to determine whether the player knows of the famous scientist by asking them a series of Who am I? questions. The game was originally developed by Dr Georgina Ferry and is used to teach women's history in schools.

In recent years, I have even designed trompe-l'oeil statues of famous artists, such as Rembrandt and Michelangelo, who are not real. Joanna Watt: How does a statue come about? Sarah Janson: People usually get in touch with me because they want me to make a statue of a famous person or animal for them. When I go to work looking for a subject for my artists, I look at newspaper and online articles about the person or animal in question. After looking at photos of the person or animal in question, I then ask myself questions like, 'Who is this person or animal?' or 'What would they look like if they were 2D or 3D?', and then I look at paintings of similar people or animals to see if I can come up with a statue. Joanna Watt: When I"," Joanna Watt asked Sarah Janson to have her art certificate verified. When asked to provide her certificate Sarah Janson proudly produced her certificate, but when asked to read the date, she said 'oh I forget'. When Joanna Watt asked Sarah Janson to remind her of the date she stated, 'why should I remember? I am Sarah Janson, a trompe-l'oeil artist who cannot read'. Joanna Watt, who is not sure if Sarah Janson is telling the truth or not, asks Sarah Janson to tell Joanna Watt the truth. Sarah Janson explains that when she was a child she could not see well, so when Joanna Watt asked her to have her art certificate verified, Sarah Janson's parents made her an earthenware vase and she then filled it with white paint and when Joanna Watt asked her to provide her certificate Sarah Janson proudly produced her certificate. When Joanna Watt asked Sarah Janson to read the date, she said 'oh I forget'. Joanna Watt says to Sarah Janson, 'oh you are lying, you always know everything'. Sarah Janson answers, 'I am Sarah Janson, a trompe-l'oeil artist who cannot read'. Joanna Watt then asks Sarah Janson to remind her of the date, and Sarah Janson says 'why should I remember? I am Sarah Janson, a trompe-"," Joanna asks Sarah to describe her work. Sarah says that her work is about deception. 

This is a story about deception. Joanna starts to paint a picture of a garden. The colors are bright and the shape of the garden is pleasing to Joanna's eye. As Joanna paints she realizes that the garden is not as it seems. The bright colors are not what they seem to be. The shape of the garden is deceiving. Joanna asks Sarah to paint another garden. This time the garden will be real. Sarah paints a real garden. Joanna looks at the garden and immediately senses that it is not what it seems. The colors seem wrong. The garden is not the shape that Joanna thought it would be. Joanna is shocked. Sarah explains that she paints trompe-l'oeil. The colors and shape of the garden are created through illusion. It does not exist in reality. 

Joanna realizes that Sarah's work is about deception. It is art that you can pick up and look at but it is not real. And even if it was real, you would not understand it. It is art about art. Joanna likes Sarah's work and gives her a compliment. This creates a positive impression of Sarah. Joanna has a negative impression of art that is not deceptive. So Sarah is a trompe-l'oeil artist. 

The idea that art can be about art and not about selling or advertising"," Joanna Watt is an author who writes novels many of which are based on historical events. Joanna Watt explains to Sarah Janson that her paintings are not reality they are illusions of one. Joanna Watt asks Sarah Janson what she does when she paints a scene she recognises from her everyday life.  Sarah Janson smiles and answers Joanna Watt when I see something that is real that is what I go for I am not trained I don't have a background in art I try to capture it as realistically as I can. Joanna Watt then asks Sarah Janson what she does if a scene looks fake to her. Sarah Janson answers Joanna Watt that I alter it to make it look more convincing. Joanna Watt then states that this is a bad answer. Joanna Watt explains that in order to be an artist you need to be able to fool people Joanna Watt then asks Sarah Janson what is fake to you. Sarah Janson then answers Joanna Watt that I look at myself in the mirror that is what is fake to me. Joanna Watt then tells Sarah Janson that this is the right answer and that what we see in the mirror is what is real to us.

Joanna Watt:  Sarah Janson is one of the best known trompe-l'oeil artists. She paints pictures that fool the eye into believing they are real.  Sarah Janson: It does take a bit of skill, because if you go to an exhibition and you are looking for paintings that look like they are made of glass you can't see all of them because they all are, but if you go in looking for a painting of a sunset or something and you see a picture that is more like a painting of a sunset you know it is trompe-l'oeil because it is just painted on to a canvas and it is not made of glass. Joanna Watt: There cannot be many artists who do not sign their work unless they are asked to sign. Sarah Janson: Oh, actually there are many artists who do not sign their work, they do that because they think it is their job to do that because they think it is the only way to sell their work, but I am the only one who does not sign my work.

" Tristan is drafted into the military, initially as an unwilling but eager conscript and then as a reluctant volunteer to aid in the defense of his land. Over the course of the book Tristan befriends the men and women who make up the republic's military, while learning and developing his own talents and beliefs. Though Tristan initially views his time as a military man with disdain he develops a close and long term relationship with several of his drill instructors. As the novel progresses Tristan grows in self esteem and in confidence, developing a number of significant and often heroic acts of bravery, patriotism, and personal integrity. Tristan emerges as a unique and impressive military man, a leader who reflects the ideals and values of Efica's founding fathers. Through his actions he becomes a symbol of hope and resilience for his fellow countrymen, and a living testament to the human capacity for courage and dignity in the face of adversity. This novel is well written, interesting, and provides a hopeful and inspiring example of a military man's journey from unwilling conscript to proud volunteer, and from a young man to an older man.


This is a fun story to write. I recommend choosing a historical figure - any historical figure - that you know well, and playing with the relationships Tristan develops with various people in his military unit and beyond. It might be fun to make some of Tristan's instructors his friends in the end, even if they weren't friends to start. It"," This history is told throughout the series as the plot unfolds, revealing the characters motivations and, most significantly perhaps, the nature of power. The narrative develops and sharpens into its climax with the birth of democracy, the triumph of an idea. 

Tristan Smith is a young man with a unique history. Born into slavery, he rises from that situation and becomes an acclaimed writer, his novels used as examples of Efica’s vibrant culture and rich literature. He becomes involved in politics and is part of a revolutionary movement that ousts the oppressive government. This results in his journey across the globe to be with the other citizens who have been displaced by the revolution. Throughout the journey Smith comes to terms with his past and develops a deep seated compassion for those who are disadvantaged. He ultimately accepts the responsibilities of citizenship and becomes an important figure in the birth of democracy. In all of this Smith is a metaphor for the power of human beings to make a difference in the world. 

Smith is a relatable character. While other countries have their equivalents in history such as Plato’s Republic and Machiavelli’s The Prince, there is a sense that Efica has such a gifted and articulate writer in slavery that it has been able to create this world where it feels that writers can be free. Moreover, Smith has the ability to communicate powerfully to his fellow citizens. This is evident in the way he rallies them to fight and to accept their role"," In Smith the author has given life to the spirit of adventure and a thirst for personal discovery. In the gripping beginning of the novel Smith is a boy at school in the country village of Highfield. He is of average height and build, not quite slender, nor excessively muscular. His clothes are simple, though the author gives him a distinct national costume. As his school work progresses and he gains the confidence of his peers he is noticed by an older student called Emily, who arranges for him to spend the summer holidays at a remote cabin in the woods owned by a local family named the Rutherfords. 
At the Rutherfords Smith meets a girl called Anna who appears to have a special relationship with him and one of the Rutherfords sons, Tom. The foursome spend many hours together exploring the surrounding countryside and learning about the local natural history and rural customs. In the evenings Smith and Anna often spend time alone in the cabin and he notices that she is becoming increasingly nervous and distracted. Smith finds himself interested in their private conversations and feels the need to reassure her. One night they are able to sneak out together to the nearby river. They are discovered by the Rutherfords and brought back to the cabin and it is here that Tristan makes the discovery that changes his life. He realises that Anna is carrying a portrait of a long dead relative in her satchel, one that had once belonged to her great-grandfather. 
T"," The reader can feel the tension between the old ways and the new in the language and manner of speaking.  Tristan Smith, a citizen of Efica, goes to great lengths to preserve the old ways. One day he encounters a mysterious stranger and in the ensuing fight both are injured. The stranger then makes a remarkable declaration: he will allow Tristan to live should Tristan kill the stranger. But Tristan is not the sort of person to take lightly insult and injury.  He goes about healing his injuries and deciding what to do about the stranger. Meanwhile, the stranger comes to life and reveals that he is in fact a god and that it was Tristan who killed the god.  Tristan is surprised and even more so is he shocked and horrified to learn that his entire life has been a lie. The gods of Efica exist and their is no one more capable of killing a god than a mere man. Tristan must now decide what his next move should be - kill the stranger, flee Efica, seek out justice from the gods - or stay and face the fact that he, Tristan Smith, has been deceived. Tristan sets off for justice with the help of his two sworn allies, a witch and a dwarf. Together the trio journey to the temple of the gods at the centre of Efica. There they discover that the gods have departed but one is left behind to take charge.  Tristan is surprised to"," The country has a proud tradition of freedom, equality and human rights, a heritage that is slowly being chipped away as the authoritarian regime of president Johnson attempts to silence the opposition. In an election year Tristan is called to serve his community as a street fighter known as a 'citizen' who will work tirelessly and unflaggingly to achieve the goals set for the nation. Tristan quickly learns that the role of the citizen is to be vigilant, tireless and to never stop fighting for justice. Tristan fights for human rights, for equality, for freedom and eventually for love, a theme that runs throughout the book and which provides the novel its strength and heart. 

Following the election of President Johnson, the regime is intent on silencing opposition. Tristan Smith is called to the streets to undertake a challenging yet humorous and enjoyable task - he will be a citizen. He will work tirelessly and unflaggingly to achieve the goals set for the nation. The novel, 'Citizen Smith', is the story of one man’s journey, told in the form of a comic political thriller. 

This novel, set in a fictional nation called Efica, is an extraordinary parable of human power history and humour. Tristan is a street fighter known as a citizen, who will work tirelessly and unflaggingly to achieve the goals set for the nation. 

Tristan Smith knows what it is like to be an ordinary man","  

In Citizen Smith we meet a young man, Tristan, who comes to believe he is the next successor to the throne of Efica. He is trained from birth and indoctrinated in the traditions and laws of Efica. In truth he is a stranger to Efican culture and a pawn in a web of political intrigue. The story takes us from the momentous to the absurd. We meet a man who wants to be king; a man who believes that the laws of Efica do not apply to him; and of course, a young man, who believes he is the heir to the throne.  

In the end Tristan learns that his whole life has been a lie.  His world has been one of illusion. But he is not truly harmed. He has learned to recognise and appreciate the reality of what is given to him. He has learned not to take everything at face value, and to ask questions.  

In Citizen Smith Martin Amis has written a tale that is both a parable and a celebration of a new world being born and a new people coming to power.  It will surely be studied and discussed for many years to come.

 The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale considers the total words, total sentences, and total syllables in a text.  Here are the values for the three indicators for the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale:  

"," The nation of Efica is a very real African nation with the ability to travel between different worlds called ‘staves’ which have their own laws, customs and traditions. The protagonist Tristan Smith has decided to seek out adventure, experience the unknown and prove himself a worthwhile citizen of Efica. When he steps foot onto one of these ‘staves’ he finds out that things may not be as he imagined. 

This book has a very well developed and rich language, a complex plot and memorable characters. The author has created a believable world which the reader is eager to learn more about. However the language is a notch down from the A1 grade. The novel has a very limited number of sentence types. The information flow is explicit and there is little use of context clues to assist comprehension. 

There is a limited use of basic sentence patterns such as ‘who’, ‘which’, ‘that’ and ‘how’ to assist in meaning construction. Some phrases are memorised word for word. 

The story has a straightforward plot. However in a low stakes setting the language can be used to engage the reader’s attention. In combination with a memorable protagonist the language is likely to bring the reader along for the ride and make them feel as though they too are a member of the cast of this fantastic novel.

Based on the provided text, I believe that the author of this novel has used basic sentence patterns to provide structure to his complex story. The"
"
  Hakan started the trumpet when he was five years old. His mother who was a nurse was always playing the piano, and her piano-playing inspired him to become a pianist. 
  Being the youngest of six children, Hakan was always the one who had to take care of others. So from a young age he learned how to look after other people and solve problems. 
  Being the only child in the family, Hakan was also the one who had to do the housekeeping. He was in charge of setting the table for the meal, making sure there were enough plates, knives and forks, etc. All of this helped him develop the patience to wait for others to do the right thing, without any expectation for results. 
  And now, some 30 years later, Hakan’s unique personality and his unrivaled talent in the trumpet-world have led him to the world-famous London’s Wigmore Hall. There he performs his own trumpet arrangements of songs from different musical eras.
  At home, Hakan is always busy with music and is always trying to come up with different arrangements. He plays almost every day for at least an hour and usually ends up creating a completely new version of the song. Hakan is loved by all in the family and especially by his wife. Although they don’t share his passion for music, they nevertheless support him both in and out of the family.

"," He has won four gold medals at the highest international competition level – the Flanders International Trumpet Festival, the Baden-Württemberg Trumpet Festival, the New York International Trumpet Challenge, and the Bayrampasa International Trumpet Festival, has held the position of trumpet soloist in major orchestras in Europe, and received high acclaim in Sweden and other countries. This is so weird to the parents of Hakan Hardenberger, who do not understand their son. His father who is a doctor is even more puzzled than his mother who is a housewife and had never shown any aptitude at all for music. It goes without saying that their parents, who have always felt they were unmusical, were completely out of their depth when Hakan won these competitions. But now they understand their son: the trumpet is what makes him stand out. 

An American trumpeter who moved to Sweden at the age of 30 established himself as the only trumpet player in the world. His parents had no musical background whatsoever, but out of the blue they now understand their son because of the trumpet.

  
Hakan Hardenberger is the only trumpet player in the world. His parents had no musical background whatsoever, but out of the blue they now understand their son because of the trumpet.

  
An American trumpeter who moved to Sweden at the age of 30 established himself as the only trumpet player in the world"," He has also founded the famous Stockholm Symphony Orchestra which is regarded as one of the most modern and influential orchestras in Europe.  How did Hakan Hardenberger become a musician?
He always had a passion for music, however as a child it was drum and not trumpet that he used. It was after a drum performance during one of his school excursions that Hakan had already seen the trumpet for the first time.  It was during his school years that Hakan met the famous trumpet-player Jorma Panula and was deeply impressed by his artistry. Jorma Panula recommended Hakan to the then Academy of Music and Drama in Stockholm where he started studying the trumpet in the class of Erika Björling.   Hakan Hardenberger’s talent for trumpet-playing was soon evident and when he was 16 he was selected to study at the prestigious Juilliard School in New York. He continued his studies in London with the renowned Sir John Tavener as his teacher. Later, during the years 1973-1981, Hakan Hardenberger was member of the Berliner Symphoniker.
Hakan Hardenberger has also composed and arranged music and has been active as a recording artist. His music has been performed by the world famous ensembles such as the Berliner Symphoniker, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Symphonie-Orchester Berlin and the Staatskapelle Berlin.  "," 

Some of the reasons why he has done this can be: He got a trumpet for his fourth birthday. His mother said: “You will need that to get your own meal when you grow up. Everyone in the street knows Hakan; he is a child of the streets.” And since elementary school he studied music at the local music school where he became the only Swede in his class. But it was his own ambition and choice. “If I did not take up this hobby, I would have never discovered a talent for it. I would have ended up in sales or something.”

So there you have it. Hakan has grown up without music in his home. He became a famous musician without any lessons. 

There is, as you can imagine, a lot of background information and context that can help readers to understand the story and relate to it. You might find it helpful to use the following background information to develop your essay: 

* The relationship between music and family 

* The importance of music education

* Swedish national pride and the music industry 

* Hakan’s upbringing in a deprived area

* Hakan’s talent and ambition 

* The role of the music teacher at the music school

The story could start with the birth of Hakan Hardenberger and tell how a local trumpet found its way into his home.

Hakan Hardenberger, only child of unmusical"," 
He comes from parents who are completely unmusical… So how did he manage to become the leading trumpet player of his generation?
“I always loved music” he explains. “My mother used to take me to the concerts when I was a kid. But it wasn’t until the university that I seriously began to play music. My family lived in a completely unmusical place but in the attic my elder brother had constructed a makeshift piano. I decided to see if I could play at it. I didn’t have any lessons but after six months, when I felt I had a grasp on the basics, I went to the local music shop and bought myself a trumpet. I began giving concerts at this piano when I was in my early teens. After completing my compulsory military service I was able to devote myself totally to trumpet playing.
Today, he is one of the most sought-after and highest paid musicians and among the top trumpet players in the world he is definitely the number one.
“The first challenge for any musician coming from a non musically informed background is to find his/her “voice” and to develop some of the rudiments in playing. It is not easy to achieve at all and Hakan has had to work incredibly hard.

The only song he was able to learn at his age was The Nutcracker and he has since become one of the most acclaimed Nutcrackers in the world.

It was merely a conversation I had this morning with Miss Mary. She is quite taken with you. It seemed she could not keep her eyes off you. I do hope that was not immodest?"" Emma stammered, still not fully comprehending what she had just heard. Charles cleared his throat. ""No, I do not think so. It is most kind of you to suggest, miss. But my eyes never leave the view that I am painting."" She smiled, looking down at the river. Charles reached out and squeezed her hand. ""It is so lovely out here today, don't you think?

Emma can approach Rouen directly.
Emma can approach Rouen through Charles.
Emma can approach Rouen indirectly.
Emma cannot approach Rouen directly.
Emma cannot approach Rouen through Charles.
Emma can approach Rouen indirectly but Charles will object.
Emma cannot approach Rouen either way.

  Option 2: approach Rouen directly
This is the best option as it fully utilizes the ability of the primary character to express himself through letter.

  Option 3: approach Rouen through Charles
This is a good option, though it is not as fully utilized as Option 2. It would be a good approach for a secondary character to communicate with a primary one.

  Option 4: approach Rouen indirectly
This is an unusual approach and would be a bad one to use. It would require outside assistance and is not the best way to approach a situation.

  Option 5: approach Rouen either way
This is the worst option as it would require outside assistance and would not fully utilize the primary character's ability to express himself through letter.

  Option 6: approach Rouen indirectly but Charles will object
This is a possible but sub-optimal approach. It would require outside assistance, but would utilize the character's ability to communicate with another character.

  Option 7: approach Rouen neither way but Charles would object
This would be"," Emma won and set off the next day to see Charles at Rouen. 
She approached a small guard at the gate and asked to see the castle where Monsieur Charles resided. She would like to speak to him. The guard was very surprised. The Empress was not aware of a male who lived at the castle. She might like to speak to the lady of the house. The lady of the house was not home but she had left a note for Monsieur Charles. Emma's face fell. She had been so looking forward to hearing his voice. 
""But he is here,"" the guard said. 
""No, I mean the lady of the house is not here,"" said Emma confused. 
""The lady of the house is here,"" the guard clarified. 
He smiled and nodded at Emma. She smiled back as she walked through the gates of the castle and towards the main door. She knocked on the door. She could hear footsteps and the door opened to reveal a very large man, at least 7 feet tall. She smiled again. 
""Monsieur Charles?"" she asked. He nodded. 
""Monsieur Charles, the Empress of Austria is here to see you.""

What kind of a name is Emma?

"," Charles won.

The following is the text of the story written by Emma:

Charles had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say. Now she could suggest that it was difficult to explain matters by letter and she offered to go over to Rouen and speak to him directly. Charles would not hear of troubling her. She insisted. It was a battle of kindness. Charles won.

Charles had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say. Now she could suggest that it was difficult to explain matters by letter and she offered to go over to Rouen and speak to him directly. Charles would not hear of troubling her. She insisted. It was a battle of kindness. Charles won.

Charles went off to find Emma, but she wasn't there. He looked around the square but could not find her. He was starting to get worried when he saw her a little way off standing by a tree. She looked very pretty, with long blonde hair down her back. He shouted, ""Emma! It's me, Charles."" And then she was by his side and he told her what had happened. ""You won the battle of kindness,"" she said. And then they both started to laugh.

And now, you can read the story written by Emma:

Charles had said exactly the name Emma wanted him to say. Now she could suggest that it was difficult to explain matters by letter and she offered to go over to Rouen and speak"," And Charles won the battle. 
Emma walked into Rouen’s house and found Charles sitting at his desk, surrounded by piles of papers and letters. She noticed that he looked up when she came in. “You asked me to speak to you,” she said. 

Charles looked up from his papers and leaned back in his chair. “You win this battle of kindness,” he replied. “You speak with the grace of the angels and I yield. But do not return tomorrow, my dear,” he added, standing up and ushering her out of the room.

The story finishes with Charles giving Emma permission to speak to him. While his decision is not completely altruistic, it demonstrates a desire to avoid conflict with his wife.

" Being a people person is now a must for individuals aspiring to leadership positions in organizations. Those aspiring to become CEOs need to have a remarkable track record of developing and motivating others. But what is this phenomenon that is blurring the lines between those with great people skills and those without? Daniel Goleman - author of the hugely successful 'Emotional Intelligence: Why It's Critical That We Find Happiness in Life"" - says this ""These days we're all expected to be more self-aware and empathetic, especially in the workplace. Even the title of this book, 'Emotional Intelligence,' seems to capture the zeitgeist. But to what extent can a person who is not particularly self-assured or outgoing actually lead a successful life? ""According to Goleman, the answer lies in the concept of emotional intelligence (EI) - a term he first introduced in his 1979 book 'Emotional Intelligence: Find Your Freckles, Find Love, Understand Life'. An individual with high levels of EI has the ability to'read' and therefore 'hear' other people's emotions as well as their thoughts. They use this awareness to their advantage to intuitively read and respond to human behavior, enabling them to'speak' the language of love and connection. They can also communicate effectively with people from all walks of life, overcoming barriers of age, gender, culture, language, etc. In other words, a lack of E"," Our social skills, our ability to influence and, yes, even to generate feelings, are all important. In some jobs, the importance of these skills may be more obvious than in others. The CEO of a major corporation may spend much of the day in close contact with investors, analysts, journalists and customers, all of whom will expect to have an impact on the fortunes of the company. But it is not just top managers who need to possess the 'people skills'. The general manager of a fast moving team may have to charm an influential client into investing in the new product that will transform their business. The'sales' person in the marketing department needs to be able to create enthusiasm about the new product and then persuade the CEO to back the launch. In all these cases it is not just that the sales or marketing function that is important but also the whole organisation that needs to respond effectively to the changing world of business. And it's not just about people skills on an individual level. Goleman argues that the ability to manage your own emotions and those of others is a valuable 'people skill' in business. Being able to influence others to do what you want them to do (the 'fighting' part of 'EQ') is important in all business - including corporate boardrooms and in the marketing department. He discusses how organisations that put their people, and each other, first have an advantage over their competitors. They understand that good business is built not just on the knowledge you have ("," In a society where speed is king and speed of communication is more important than ever, the ability to sense and read others, a critical component of emotional intelligence, will be the key to success.  

While many managers focus on the technical skills required to deliver successful projects, the reality is that the ability to communicate well, listen intently and develop deep human relationships will determine your professional success. It starts with getting to know your people, cultivating a sense of trust and instilling a culture of respect.  You will perform better if you can empathize with your team members and if your people feel they can reach out and ask for help. Emotional Intelligence, although difficult to measure, is critical for ensuring your career growth and is considered  among the most sought after skills of the job market in years to come. 

The author highlights that many people are choosing to use self-assessments to measure their emotional Intelligence in order to build on their strengths and improve their relationships with others.  

Here is the text for the story:

Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success
Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of our profession 

People skills are the key to success. The ability to sense and read others, a critical component of emotional intelligence, will be the key to success. While many managers focus on the technical skills required to deliver successful projects, the reality is that the ability to"," For organisations to thrive in the new competitive environment the old adage'show me the money' has to be complemented by'show me the person'. The ability to manage, lead and inspire in order to create a culture of excellence is now a crucial element of success. To be successful in today's world people need to be able to'read' other people, to be empathetic, to motivate and to get along with others. Daniel Goleman, author of 'Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ in Success in a complex world'  breaks down how emotional intelligence is essential for success in the modern workplace.

There are two key elements to emotional intelligence:
1. Self awareness: The ability to recognize and understand one’s own feelings and behaviours
2. Self management: The ability to motivate oneself, set goals and reach them. 

“The more emotional intelligence a person has, the more they can use it to their advantage, because emotional intelligence helps you understand how to motivate others, how to lead and how to build effective relationships. An emotionally intelligent person has all of the other skills, but another quality that emotional intelligence gives them is the ability to use those skills to take advantage of other people and create value for other people”  - Daniel Goleman, author of 'Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ in Success in a complex world.

From a literary perspective, the story is presented using simple,"," We are not robots, but neither are we any longer entirely cut off from one another. It is no longer acceptable to simply give orders and expect people to carry them out. If we want to succeed in this fast moving, ever more complex and unpredictable world, we need to be able to read people, to understand them and to be able to communicate with them in a way that is both effective and rewarding to them. That is what has always set humans apart from animals - our ability to read each other's feelings and motives. It is a combination of factors, a synthesis of all the skills, knowledge and competences we have been honing over many years, that will determine whether we climb the career ladder or remain at the very bottom of the pecking order. If we want to lead successful and satisfying lives, we must first understand others and their worlds. We must learn to listen attentively to people's feelings and to empathize with their point of view. We must be able to express our emotions openly and honestly, even when these are contrary to our personal values. Above all, we need to be able to recognize our own emotional triggers, to be able to step back from our own 'automatic responses' and be able to exercise the 'power of positive thinking'. But although understanding and perceiving others' feelings and motives are both a prerequisite and key to success, they are not enough - we also need to practice these skills, we need to develop them. We need to"," We are all becoming more 'intrapreneur' as we become more comfortable using our own ideas, energies and communications. How well we handle ourselves at work and how well we manage with others are keys to our professional successes. We must learn how to communicate effectively, how to listen intently and care, how to motivate others and how to build relationships. Our 'people skills' are our most valuable asset and this has been recognized in recent management books. In recent decades people skills have taken on a greater importance to success in business. But what is it? Daniel Goleman in his book, 'Emotional Intelligence' tries to explain the key ingredients to 'people skills'. Daniel believes that emotional intelligence is an even more important factor in success and success than IQ. He defines emotional intelligence as the ability to understand and respond to emotions in others.

Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success by Daniel Goleman 

It is a short but powerful story about two people"," This means being able to read other people and understand how they think. We now know that our  emotional intelligence - or ability to sense and understand others and make  them feel good about themselves too - is  the secret to  personal achievement. And Goleman sets out a way to cultivate these skills. We have long thought that  intelligent people are happier and more  successful than those of us who are not so well educated. But are they really so much cleverer than us? Is it not just a question of knowing your stuff and being able to use  it?  However, this theory has failed to take into account another important and arguably more important factor: how we feel about ourselves and how we interact with others.  So perhaps it is not just about  knowing  your stuff but feeling good about yourself and about others and  being able to create an  atmosphere of positivity and mutual support  which is key to making everyone feel good.  And this is why we know that our emotional intelligence is  the key to personal achievement. 

The idea that  emotional intelligence is a key  to personal  achievement  - and that this is especially the case for those with the top jobs in organisations - has generated  enormous interest in recent years and has even made it into the popular press. In the book and television series You - The Story of Your Life, Bill Gates  announces that the secret to his success"

- Gitter:", The ideal radio should have the following characteristics - sound quality - the radio should be able to provide clear and undistorted sound from the speakers. It should also have good battery life - some radio's have rechargeable batteries that will last for 6 months. A modern TV set can display information that is relevant to you while the radio is performing the task of broadcasting the information. Many of us have an iPad that we can use to control and access our radio. So if you are able to persuade people to use your radio you will be on the way to building an excellent business. But what else would make a good radio? A number of factors: Size - how big is the radio compared to the other items in your bedroom or lounge? Should it fit in the palm of your hand or must you cradle it in your hand? Does it look attractive - is the radio well presented with the correct artwork on the front? The manufacturer's warranty - how easy is it to obtain the manufacturer's warranty? Many modern radios come with warranties of at least 5 years which is great value. Is it easy to operate - how intuitive is the radio operation? Is it easy to find the knobs and fiddly bits? What will your radio cost? Will it cost less than £100? Will you need an amplifier to power the radio? How much will the amplifier cost? If you want a digital radio then some radios now have internet access which means you will need to subscribe to a subscription service," Well, to start with, how do you know if it's broken? This is where the internet can come to the rescue. Many people have posted pictures of their broken clocks on the internet, and you can simply search through these to find out if your clock is broken. But then you have the problem of how do you know which is the best clock to buy? There are many options and although it is tempting to go for the most expensive one, think hard before you buy a clock. Do you really need a clock? Most people need to know the time of day, so a clock is not required. Do you want to know what the time of day is? Some people would like to know the time of day in order to adjust their sleep cycle, or for scientific studies. In this case a clock is a good idea, and it's one you should consider buying. It is best to start with a reputable brand, as this will ensure you get the best quality clock for your money.

Sound the Alarm Stuart Harris

Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Well, to start with"," In his new book “Sound the Alarm: A Practical Guide to Buying a Radio that’s Right for You” author Stuart Harris provides advice on how to make these important decisions. He begins by asking you “What is a radio for?” A radio is not an iPad or smartphone. While the two products are similar they serve different functions. Unlike a smartphone or tablet a radio is primarily for listening to media – whether that be through the device’s built in stereo speakers or through an external amplifier. But Stuart goes on to say there is more to a radio than merely listening to media. Radio sets come with a range of features that will help you to get the most out of your radio, such as the ability to input a range of different media formats so that you can listen to your favourite stations. Another useful feature is the ability to set different volume levels for each member of the family or a group of friends. Stuart lists the important features that you should consider when buying your next radio. Before buying check the radio will last you for at least 3 years and that the battery lasts at least a week after a power outage. He also recommends considering your budget as well as your individual needs when choosing a radio for your home. Overall this is a highly helpful guide to buying a radio. Stuart’s advice on how to choose the right radio for your needs is sound and his extensive research on the market has helped to provide a useful and clear guide. This short guide can be"," “Look for one that plays your favorite music,” people say. “Ask friends,” people say. “Google reviews will help you,” people say. But you can save yourself time and trouble by going to a specific website and searching for “clock radios with X features.” You’ll find all kinds of features, but the most important one is probably color. Avoid orange (too warm), yellow (too warm), or beige (too boring) and you’ll save yourself a lot of time and trouble. The company you purchase from should have a web site where you can look up reviews for specific models of clock radios. So, if your friend recommends one, go look it up. If you need to make a choice between a lot of similar options you can do a simple “ordering by” feature where you pick a category from a menu and the list will order itself based on criteria you set (price, weight, etc.) This is especially important if you’re comparing radio models with different bands. Different radio models use different bands. If you want to know how well a radio model will work with your car’s radio band, you can use a web site that lets you specify a radio band (FM band, AM band, or both) and it will tell you what will receive it properly, whether it is FM stereo, AM stereo, or whether it requires an antenna. So, if you’re shopping for a clock radio you should consider both the features you need ("," Well, you could go to a store and look at all the options. You could even consult a book. But that would be rather time consuming. Instead, you should use the internet. All you have to do is enter ""radio clock radios"" in google, and you will be presented with a range of choices. Some of the most popular brands are Samsung, Philips, Car radio etc. But how do you know which is the best? Well, you could look at reviews and other customer feedback. However, what if you don't like reading reviews or don't have the time to do that? There is one other way. You can consult the internet for advice. And most importantly, you should ask your partner. Most people will agree that their spouse is the best person to ask, for numerous reasons. You may have similar tastes to your partner, and so will be more likely to find the right radio. In addition, most people find that it is less challenging to make changes to a product, than to explain it to someone they do not understand. In fact, the internet makes it very easy to ask someone who does not understand a complex product for advice. So if you are in need of picking a radio, you could turn to the internet for advice. And if your partner is on hand to answer your questions, you could save both time and effort. In summary, the internet is your friend when you need it and your partner is your best friend.

" 
  I was ten years old and didn’t even know that most kids in that position would bemoan the loss, but I was inconsolable. My parents had just moved to New Zealand and I had spent many years in boarding schools in the United States, and I was suddenly without my familiar summers. 
  “No summer??!” I asked my father. 
  “I’m afraid not,” he replied. “The trees didn’t like that too well.” My eyes grew wide. My parents had been expecting me, and instead had to return to the United States with my unseasonable sadness. They had planned to spend at least some time in New Zealand, where Jonathon was now working as a forest ecologist, but there were suddenly no more summer quarters for my father to return to the United States with me. They had to go back to boarding school. I was devastated. “You’ll have a new summer in a new place next year,” my father promised, but I was inconsolable for months.

 The prompt is followed by nine statements. Each statement relates to Jonathon Porritt and Dani Gardner. Please explain why Jonathon Porritt spoke to Danny Danziger and not to his daughter.

 I spoke to Danny Danziger because Jonathon Porritt was unhappy that I didn't have summers and was talking to me instead of his daughter.

 The statement relating to me is:
Jon"," My stake in New Zealand gifted me a year without summer. I’ve never grown to love summer like I did the year without it! As a boy who grew up in the UK, summer was my favorite part of the year. It’s hard to describe in words the sense of calm, of security and familiarity that summer brings. Even at a young age I was aware that summers had their own way of working, their own rhythms, and that’s how I learned to navigate them as an adult, too - by watching them. But my year in New Zealand was quite the shock. Every day was an adventure, whether it was walking to school through the lush, green landscape and the myriad species of birdsong, or tramping through the hills to the farm and seeing how the soil was changing under my feet with each step. In those first months I had to learn to use the sun’s warmth to keep going in the cold dark winter months, and so the seasons in New Zealand became a critical part of how I thought about them. I learned to know winter and autumn because of my years without summer, and I’m sure that was the most remarkable discovery of my life. As the months went on I got better and better at figuring out the rhythms of summers. They were predictable and easy to navigate; there was food to eat and places to go and people to meet, and I started to know the lay of the land. Summer began to feel like it"," I missed out on the fun things in life. I missed camping, fishing, hunting, playing cricket, playing football. But the best thing of all, I missed not having the trees to talk to every summer. We all know what a joy it is to get tree advice from a majestic, ancient being. Trees are clever. They know us better than we know ourselves. When a tree’s bark is really rough, it means you should be careful. When it’s really smooth, it means you need to stop what you are doing immediately. Trees know your deepest, darkest secrets. And trees want to share this wisdom with you. I miss talking to trees. But they are much too busy these days. The logging companies are cutting down the old growth trees at an unprecedented rate. And they have started replacing them with fast-growing pine trees. And I’m worried about the pine trees. They’re not as wise as the old growth trees. They’re not as clever as the trees I planted. They could disappear in a flash. They’re just trees. But they are my trees. They’re my legacy. I’ve planted tens of thousands of trees all over the world, most of them in New Zealand. But now, I need to make sure that those trees survive this great threat to their survival. I know a tree that can help me. It has a special connection with me. Tee, she’s a ki"," Not one summer. The days got hot but no summer. A deep freeze followed and then the days got cold. It was an unsettling experience. Then I got to witness the most beautiful, spectacularly colourful and totally mesmerising display of fireflies in the summer of 2012. They were swarming all over the dark forest and lightening the night for weeks. The event had a profound influence on my life. It inspired me to write a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale using the following prompt: With the trees I planted my stake in New Zealand JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER

Jonathon Porritt talks to Danny Danziger, the famous firefly expert, about the fireflies that inspired him to write a story about them that is readable by Grade 2 learners. Danny tells Jonathon about a visit he made to a firefly festival in Italy where the crowd could see the fireflies in person. Danny shares his curiosity about the behaviour of the fireflies which led to the discovery that the insects could see in the dark. The story Jonathon writes is about a boy who had a most peculiar period of his life when he did not have any summers. Jonathon recalls one day when the days got hot but no summer. After witnessing the spectacular display of fireflies in the summer of 2012, the experience had a profound effect"," In fact my summer used to start in April because my school days used to start in April and then go until the first week of September, so what did I do? 

I read books from my parents’ library, which had been saved from the great flood. My favourite books at the time were Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Dannenberg, Treasure Island by Stevenson and Little Black Sambo by Watterson.

The idea of growing one’s own food, building shelters and being your own boss seemed very exciting, so I started to clear an area in the backyard where I built a shack.

Of course I didn’t expect I would be spending much time there - it was just a place for me to store some of my things and to play my guitar, but that turned out to be quite an adventure.

I got the idea to start a vegetable garden from reading an article in the ‘New York Times’ about farmers who grew kale by seeding lettuce seed on the ground and then plucking the kale when it was ready. 

After some research, I found that a vegetable garden can be a fascinating and rewarding experience. The plants help to improve air quality, as most of the dirt is turned into compost and the plants help pollute- less areas of the ground. I also found that if I planted some seeds, they are quite cheap and therefore an opportunity to grow food for others at no cost.

So that’s how"," It's not clear where I went or what I did, but I woke up one morning and the whole experience of summer had been stolen from me.

"," I had planted a stake in New Zealand some time earlier, which gave me hope and energy to continue the journey of self-discovery.  

At some point in the past, I read something about tsunami and said I want to go there and experience it for myself. So, I contacted an NGO, who organised a trip for us. 

When we landed, my first perception was that we are in another world. I didn’t recognise the place, the language and the customs. There were many people dressed in bright orange clothes and we looked like new arrivals to this world. 

The organisation organised for us three tsunami tours in New Zealand. The first tour was the most interesting. We had the chance to swim under water with the sea. I realised my mistake; I am afraid of the water. 

Then we went to the nearby town which was hit by the second tsunami. I did recognise that place but it was like a dark and gloomy world. 

Finally we went to the second biggest city, Auckland. I don’t really like big cities. There were lots of cars and heavy traffic everywhere. The place felt empty and looked dark. I did recognise that city. 

After we went back to the hotel I asked my friends, ""Is there a third tsunami tour?"". I have to say that I was expecting a different answer from them. They were sceptical about the whole thing. I was sure of it"

Have a go at writing a story using this prompt.

Hide and Seek Yvonne Coppard

Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game — surveillance of a suspicious bookshop — when she realises that one of its rare customers is her Uncle Jim. He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard. 

However, her love for Jim brings her friends back into his fold — especially when she sees him commit a crime.

What happens next is heart-warming.

  * This is a well-written story. The characters are well-developed, the setting is appealing and the mystery is intriguing. Coppard presents them in a believable manner that makes you want to read more.
  * The resolution of the story feels appropriate given the circumstances. Jim's actions are reprehensible and he comes to realise his guilt.
  * The use of tropes and devices like love conquers all and family come together are effective. 
  * There is an alliteration in the title between seek and hide, which works well.

  * Coppard demonstrates an understanding of tropes and devices by"," As the game unwinds and the plot unfolds, she realises how to escape her predicament.

Your story will likely follow the same structure as this one, with a beginning, middle, and end, but there are a few key differences. For example, it’s much more likely that Uncle Jim will contact Yvonne. She will know his intentions because she is her Uncle Jim, and she has a strong affection for him. The friends of hers will similarly know her affection. Her friend Emma is a very good friend, someone she trusts. The story will move forward from her discovery that her uncle is guilty until it is revealed that she can escape her predicament. She will take action to do so.

Use the following images as a guide to completing your story:

  1. This is a surveillance photograph of a bookshop. The bookshop is unique, with a distinctive cover art, which Yvonne perceives to be a significant feature. 
  2. The image shows a person walking into the shop, who is thought to be a suspicious person. The person is not captured by the surveillance camera as they entered the shop. 
  3. Yvonne’s uncle is a known suspect for his criminal activities and he is believed to be in the bookshop. She is told to look out for him and she notices him enter the shop.

  4. The uncle is attempting to persuade Yvonne to change","


Your story begins when Yvonne Coppard's character notices a person that they think might be her Uncle Jim. They go to investigate and discover that he is in fact not her Uncle but a customer, and the customers are being targeted by her Uncle Jim for some nefarious purpose. Their uncle is targeting Yvonne's friends as they are perceived to be more ""desirable"" than the customers. Yvonne is convinced that her friend are being set up and that she is in fact being manipulated by her uncle. Her friend take her side and reveal to the customers that Yvonne is actually her best friend. Yvonne is then reunited with her friend and the friends set about pursuing their holiday game of ""hide and seek"" while the customers are distracted.


This is a well written piece, the characters are very well developed and the themes of manipulation and betrayal are prevalent in the piece. The subtle hints of Jim's nefarious activities throughout the piece adds to the reader's curiosity and make them want to find out more. The plot moves briskly and there is a good mix of comedy and tension. This piece would be suitable for any level of learner and is guaranteed to keep the readers attention.


Enjoy!

The story begins with Emma Coppard, 16, a keen student pursuing a degree in criminal science. One day, while working her last hours at the lab, Emma notices that a suspicious man is browsing a rare bookstore. Her curiosity getting the better of her, she sneaks into the shop and attempts to gain information about its customers. One of the customers is her Uncle Jim, who she has not seen in years. To her surprise, Emma discovers that he has been living a double life and secretly is pursuing a sinister plan to destroy the people he loves.

Whilst this sounds like it could be another standard dystopian novel, it is very unique in that it incorporates real world clichés of criminal masterminds and untrustworthy family members. The way the author builds the tension throughout the story really works well and keeps you turning the pages.


A2 learners would likely be able to read this within the confines of a typical A2 novel, though would need a certain level of"," 

The story is entertaining, engaging and has a good balance of character development and plot progression. Coppard's affection for Jim is shown to be genuine and her friends' personalities are clearly drawn. The main storyline is a traditional story of a search to uncover a hidden object. The ending is a surprise and leaves the reader wanting more.

Writing
Coppard's first-person narrative is told in the present tense"," 

A2 learners will find Yvonne Coppard's fictional story easy to read and understand — using basic sentence patterns with memorised phrases, using explicit information and limited number of information points — as it matches the CEFR A2 standard. Coppard uses limited information points in order to build the reader's sympathy for her main character — particularly in relation to her struggle to overcome her uncle's manipulation — and to provide the reader with a believable, complex storyline. Coppard also includes a number of explicit details in order to allow the reader to fully grasp the story's main events, although many of these details are omitted in the assessment.

" Barbara Michaels, her equally quiet but equally clever assistant, could not have hoped for a better setting in which to find out why the famous writer, who has sold over 20 million copies of her books, is known as the Brilliant Baker. 

James meets James in a coffee shop, but it feels like a private moment between the author of The Murder Room and Barbara, the assistant who helps her to write her greatest works. James, who has just returned from a conference in Rome, explains to Barbara what a thrill it was to be in Rome and to attend the conference where she met an Italian detective novelist who shares so many similarities with her own writing style.

James is intrigued by the story of Dora Boutros, the name under which the Italian writer signs her books. It takes a genius to pen mysteries as devious as those of Dora Boutros, James thinks to herself. The Italian novelist's face lights up when she talks about her discovery of the author of the Mysterious Case of the Phantom Gardener. James explains to Barbara that she has heard of Barbara but has never heard of Dora Boutros. 

The two women chat as the scent of coffee and freshly baked croissants mingles with the sweet aroma of freshly brewed coffee beans from a nearby machine. Barbara Michaels' eyes light up as the story of the Phantom Gardener unravels. The author tells her that, as a child,"," 

James is the author of the tenacious and fiercely independent Miss Rose Macaulay series, which have garnered numerous awards and accolades including the prestigious Macavity prize from the Crime Writers' Association. Barbara recalls that when she was first introduced to P.D. James' work, she found it hard to believe that such a quiet person could have such an imaginative and curious mind. Barbara explains that when she met P.D. James, she was a reader in her early forties, but that she had not read any crime novels since she was a teenager, and she was taken aback by her wide knowledge of the genre. 

James, whose husband is a builder, began reading her the titles of the books her husband had recommended, and then started referring to them as her husband'read' them. Barbara adds that when they were asked to sign books at the end of a reading, James signed her own name and her husband's name as'readers'. James' trademark was to make occasional references to having read one too many crime novels as she continued her exploration of what crime stories involved and the clues that had been missed. Barbara explains that James had a wealth of information on a whole variety of topics including the criminal justice system and the role of the police in the United Kingdom and the United States. Barbara was particularly taken with James' knowledge of the US justice system, which she used as the setting for a number of her detective novels. 
"," Yet look beneath the surface of that mild-mannered exterior, and you will find the author of many international bestsellers, including 'Cinderella', 'Hornblower', and 'The Whale'.


Barbara Michaels  would like to meet the incomparable P.D. James.  James lives an enigmatic life of the brain and the streets.

Women on a winning streak was published in the April 21, 1915 issue of the magazine The Dial.  At the time, The Dial, which published progressive content, was considered radical. The article, by Kathrine Sarkis, an Armenian Canadian and former teacher, was written as part of its Woman’s Hour section and talked about how the women athletes had “gone out and conquered the world of sport.” The writer praised the women for “cheerful, hard-working wives and daughters who have sacrificed in silence”. The magazine’s Woman’s Hour column was controversial at the time for its focus on women’s rights.

The article, which was reprinted in two other magazines, such as Outing, also attracted positive response. After the first publicisation in The Dial in 1915, the story was reprinted again in Outing in 1917.

This amazing group of women from many countries come together and exemplify what it means to be a champion.

To excel in any sport is hard enough even far men but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records. 

This amazing group of women from many countries come together and exemplify what it means to be a champion.

  
A group of women come together and are overcoming both prejudice and the odds. They are excelling in a sport that is hard for women to succeed in. They are breaking records and showing that women can achieve anything they put their minds to. 

This inspiring story makes a point about how women should not be held back from achieving their dreams. They should not be discouraged from pursuing their goals because of the difficulties they face. This can be done if they believe they can do it and push themselves to the limits. The strength they find in their beliefs will enable them to overcome any challenges they face.

Use the following information to write a story that is readable by A2 learners using the following prompt:  

On the road to Rio a tough training routine is about to begin. First the team will run along the ocean for a few miles then swim a few hundred yards before paddling back to the beach. The routine continues until they reach the city of Rio where the finals of the Games are taking place. 

After a tough practice the athletes arrive in Rio ready for what could be their last chance to compete. They are determined to show the world that women can compete with men in the same arena and on the same day as the best athletes in the world. 

Once in Rio the women have their work cut out for them. They will be facing a powerful Russian team and will also have to contend with a local favorite, a half-American, half-Brazillian swimmer, who seems to always perform well in Rio. But the women of Brazil have an edge, their combined talent and grit are about to show the world. 

The athletes get a taste of the pressure as they watch on TV as the women from Russia scale the Olympic cauldron and win their fourth consecutive gold medal. The athletes have a quick bite to eat in the village then get into their suits and begin the long swim to the beach to begin their evening before the start of their routine the next morning. 
"," This inspiring story about the spirit of sportsmanship and the power of sport to unite communities is told by an American journalist who writes from the perspective of a female American athlete.


This passage from the article is a readable narrative, although some words or phrases (such as “sacrifices” and “sportsmanship”) might not be particularly common in the general language of Americans. The passage also uses a Level 2 Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level algorithm to grade it, with a grade level of 8.5, which is on the higher end for text passages at this level. The passage does not use any special punctuation, so would be suitable for use in a reader as well as in an essay.


Despite the positive qualities in this article, it doesn’t mention anything about gender bias or the role of sports in uniting communities.


Instead, the author of this article uses sports as a metaphor to describe the struggle of women to be accepted in traditionally male-dominated fields. This is a good use of sports to discuss societal prejudices about gender roles, but it is a bit stronger than necessary since it is not directly related to the topic of the article.


If you are interested in using sports as a metaphor to describe gender bias, you might want to consider changing the metaphor so that it doesn’t overstate the impact of gender bias. For example, you could substitute sports with another form of competition that does"," 

The story of equal opportunity and hard work should be told 

The story could start at a national level with the country winning a major championship, followed by a chapter explaining how this is only the start of what could be a long winning streak. Throughout the story the reader will get an insight into the sacrifices the women are making, and the prejudice they have to overcome. Finally they could end the story by the women themselves speaking about their efforts and the progress they have made.


### Example story

On Saturday 5 April, the national team won the World Cup. Two months later, the team are on a winning streak and are beating men in every major competition. However, this has not been easy. Prejudice is common and many people do not think women can succeed in sports. This is why the team has to be twice as tough. Despite the hard work and sacrifice, their record keeps getting better.

" Money is always the issue."" 

Write a summary of the meeting, highlighting the key points and the information revealed.

Mr. Phelan sat in his recliner and said, ""Welcome home, Sara. I am glad to have you here with us. As you can imagine, this has been a difficult time for our family, but with your help, we have everything we need for the next few years. 

""Now, my wife and I want to share something with you that is very important to us. Your father was a very successful businessman, but we never knew that side of him. He kept that side of himself very secret, which is why we don't have that kind of money for you. But I believe we can help you now, and over the next few years, we can ensure that your life will be settled, while we work on being able to provide you the rest of the money that you will need to live a comfortable life.

""Mr. O'Malley told us about your sister. You are next in line to take control of the company when your father retires. He said you have a great business plan. And we agree.

So then you went to an asylum owner?"" I nodded. ""That must have been fun. I wish my parents had done that. I would be rich by now."" ""You are funny. You are also insane."" ""Thank you. I have a lot of money."" ""You've got a lot of lies."" ""Oh. Then that's a good thing. I will give it to you."" I took a pen and paper out of my bag. ""Write down everything he said."" ""He said that you went to an asylum owner. I laughed at you and told you to tell the police. He then grabbed the pen out of my hand and put a knife to my throat and started stabbing me.

The following text is the first paragraph of an article written by Susan Page about an interview she did with an 11 year old girl named Samantha Phelan. The interview is used in this sample story to show how a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level could be used to grade readability of the text.


When Samantha Phelan first saw her psychiatrist, Dr. Phelan, she said she had heard a lot of talk that wasn't normal for her age. Dr. Phelan told her not to pay attention to the talk, though, because he was just trying to help her.

Samantha's mom said she was worried about her daughter, because when she talks to her friends she tells them things she hasn't told her mom or her therapist. She tells them that she has a pet rat and that her mom can't tell anyone about it.


Dr. Phelan had promised Samantha he would take care of her in his will. The psychiatrist told her he was just trying to help her son, who was trying to take advantage of her.


There were many promises all broken. Dr. Phelan was either crazy or he wasn't, either way it didn't matter to Samantha. It wasn't what she cared about.


Samantha said she knew a lot more than her therapist, who was a new doctor."," I want to leave my children some money in his will."" ""How did you convince him to give you the money?"" ""The children?"" ""The money, Mr. Phelan."" ""Well, I told him about my troubles trying to take care of my children alone. I told him how difficult it had become for us with the lack of money."" ""Well, I'll be darned. He finally agreed to give you the money, didn't he?"" ""Of course."" ""Well, if he won't tell me his thoughts, how will I convince him?"" ""You can make a good case, you know. A lot of people are listening."" ""You make a good case?"" He thought about it for a second. He couldn't remember having promised anything. He must have dreamed it. So he was dreaming about money right now. He certainly was. He was dreaming about his will. He was going to leave his children millions of dollars. So much money. That would solve all his problems. He would have plenty of money to take care of his children. The last promise was already kept. ""That's right. I remembered. You make a good case."" He leaned forward to get a better look at him, his eyes shining with excitement. That's when the dream began. He was on his feet quickly, almost knocking over the coffee table, running out of his office and down the hall to his private office. Everything was in chaos.

""Can you please write down that I believe in God?""

Story: Mr. Phelan was very strange. He was either crazy or not, it didn't matter to me.  When my mom brought me to his house, he was trying to sell me things. It was all about money. It's not what you think.  I think Mr. Phelan has a son who is just like him. I don't want to be part of this family. But I want to stay with my mom because she believes in God.  She says she believes in God but I can tell she doesn't really.

  We love taking in strays and have a volunteer scheme called ‘Bringing Up Badgers’ which involves local schools having weekly pig-keeping classes. ‘What now?’ was followed by a chorus of ‘ewwww’ and another of ‘that’s gross’. My husband and I looked on aghast. 
  ‘That’s because that is a pig foetus and its mother is over here in the box.’ My helper pointed to a cardboard frame on the kitchen counter that we hadn’t noticed before. She was right – inside the box were six pig foetuses with their mothers, each around 10 days old.


The good people at the Dairy Farm in Somerset have taken the difficult step of opening their facilities to strays and orphaned animals and are now seeing the benefits in the form of healthy piglet births


Our dairy farm in Somerset, UK, is renowned for looking after orphaned animals. We established a volunteer scheme called ‘Bringing Up Badgers’ which involves local schools having weekly pig-keeping classes. 

To our surprise, six pig foetuses were born inside the box. The good people at the Dairy Farm in Somerset have taken the difficult step of opening their facilities to strays and orphaned animals and are now seeing the benefits in the form of healthy piglet births.


This is an excellent example of how small actions can lead to big changes and can inspire others to follow suit. It's important"," This means that should one of them be found wandering near our farm it’s more than likely that it’ll end up with us. Whilst we’d love to be able to rehome our animals we understand that not all hope is lost for strays. We call these animals ‘badgers’ because as far as we’re aware they were the most likely culprit for Britain’s mysterious hobo graveyard – where the bones of over 6,000 missing people from all over the UK have been laid to rest. 

“Badgers” is what the helpers call the animals we rescue from the fields and lanes of our Somerset dairy farm. Unfortunately, when one of the herd wanders onto our farm – no longer able to fend for itself due to old age – it’s more than likely that it will end up living out the rest of its life in the fields and lanes than being stuffed in a box at a moment’s notice. 

Despite the fact that our ‘badgers’ look rather “villagey” – there are limits to what you can put in a cardboard box. Whilst I could rush over to the local store and stock up on a box the size needed, there’s nothing that says “I can’t get a box from Home Depot” better. 

So when my helpers shout “Badger!” I dash out into the fields to try to catch them in a box. When I spot the poor"," This week, following a spate of badger attacks on buildings and crops, we were approached by an impassioned farmer with a pair of badgers who would do. 

With little choice, my husband and I agreed to ‘adopt’ the badgers – on one condition, the farmer would have a say in the day to day running of the pair. We agreed to provide appropriate sanctuary, basic food needs and – above all else – the freedom to roam our extensive meadows and woodlands. 

Our plan, which we shared with the farmer, was to gradually introduce the badgers to the outside world with a goal of them feeling safe enough to return to the farm. We agreed to keep them on the farm for the month of July, during which time we would ensure they were comfortable, socialised, fed and watered and helped to recover any sick animals. 

The farmer is an enthusiastic and dedicated man, and although this had not been his intention, he felt he had little option. We’ve been inundated with applications from farmers and animal rescue groups from all over the UK, with some from as far afield as France, Italy and Spain. 

The badgers are a young pair, a mother and a newborn baby, and they arrived last Tuesday. Our family of six has been busily preparing our new neighbours’ quarters as they haven’t had the luxury of a roof over their heads for more than 10 years."," 
  “We’ll find them a home,” we promise. But as badgers come by with their babies in their mouths they are hard to miss. We’ve seen them running around our dairy field, across our chicken run and through the orchard next door. 
We’ve even found a baby badger in our freezer. 
  This is only one of the animal-related lessons that have continued to come naturally to me since my training at the Badger Training School. Derek and I started our training with the aim of providing training to all our employees, particularly the ten who became our first badger recruits. But we quickly realised that, like any animal, badgers like to play and that the work that we teach them could easily transfer to other parts of the business. 
  So we’ve continued to train new badger recruits while looking at ways to apply the badger-work across the business. At the same time we’ve had to look to other areas of the business to take on the tasks we were happy to leave to the badgers. 
  These include the work of our farm manager, who used to look after the farm’s buildings, and the team working across the farm, who used to prepare our cows for the milking parlour. We’ve moved these to other roles and trained our employees to do them on our behalf. 
  The badgers are working hard, but their work seems to be paying off."," When one of our cows became weak and couldn’t walk we received numerous calls from vets and animal rescue groups alike. We agreed a bounty price for the cow and her two calves of £700 and were able to make the transition to dairy keepers ourselves, as they say. What now? Well, that’s the million pound question I keep asking myself. Although we have a good system in place to look after our animals we’re acutely aware of how much work it is to give them a better life and run a business at the same time. We will never be able to repay our debt of gratitude to all those who looked after our cow and her calves but what will we do to repay their kindness? We will continue to look after abandoned and orphaned animals, which now numbers over 40 of all species, and ensure they have an easy life. We hope to develop a network of supporters so we can look after even more animals should they need our help. And if we can ever repay a small amount of gratitude to our rescuers we will do so. It’s a balance to keep trying to build a successful dairy business, which has been difficult due to the recession, while at the same time attempting to find a way to repay the kindness of those who rescued and looked after our orphaned cows. 

Your prompt should be:

BRINGING UP BADGERS
‘What now?’ is my immediate thought when one of my helpers"," Having looked after cows, sheep and pigs – and enjoyed a sheepdog from the same pack – our farm now houses chickens, ducks and geese. The chickens are an entirely different story.  ‘What now?’ was my immediate thought as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. Having looked after cows, sheep and pigs – and enjoyed a sheepdog from the same pack – our farm now houses chickens, ducks and geese. The chickens are an entirely different story. In a shed on our farm, my helper removed the box of newly arrived chicks, placed it on the floor, and said, ‘Pick one of these to join your mom!’ I reached out my hand to take one of the chicks, but it was much too heavy for my small fingers and I looked up in shock. There had to be something wrong. We’d had a few chickens before, but this flock was significantly larger than the last and seemed to contain a great many ducklings. The box was actually empty. ‘We have ducklings, not chickens,’ said my helper. ‘You’ll need to eat bread crumbs and hen poop to make them chicken-like,’ she advised, removing a tiny cage from the back of the shelf and offering it to me. ‘Once they learn your chicken-like smell"," We’ve had goats, sheep, donkeys, ducks and geese on our farm. And we’ve also got sheep that have become mixed up in a cattle truck on a big Welsh cattle farm, so we are ‘ Bringing Up Badgers’.  

‘Bringing Up Badgers’ does a good job of setting out my initial reaction, but is lacking in key details. It includes a limited amount of information, makes few grammatical and syntactic use of word forms, lacks a memorable structure and contains explicit information.  

Badgers are a species of weasel-like mammal that live in England, Wales, and southern Scotland. Over the last few years, their numbers have been greatly reduced by a process known as ‘culling’. While a cull is sometimes described as a method of removing unwanted wild animal populations by killing them, it may also involve the capture and human care of the animals. Derek and I have given orphaned badgers an opportunity to live out their days in our animal enclosures in exchange for food and care. ‘Bringing Up Badgers’  is one of the funnier humorous take on badgers, but falls short on being accessible to a learner of CEFR level A2.


I’m a badger mummy!  We have geese, ducks, donkeys, sheep, goats and a cat and we rescue orphaned badgers and care for them until their fate is"
" The second part would be the 'local' newspapers - they are the ones who know about your store and are more likely to buy from you if you have reviewed there. It also benefits us as you can trust that we have no conflict of interest when we are writing a review - unless of course we are reviewing one of our own titles.

Publisher B We like to give 1st class reviews for all the books we publish. Reviews help readers make a purchase from us, and give us the recognition from an established organisation that we are doing a good job. Our sales team like to see a number of 1st class reviews, and are much more likely to make a sale if they have seen a review on a 'top reviewer' site.

Publisher C We do offer reviews of books that we publish on Amazon - so those customers can see our reviews of our own books.

Publisher D We do not offer reviews of books we do not publish. However we are happy to review books we have co-authored.

Publisher E Reviews of books we have reviewed on Amazon do help with sales. So we try to ensure that all our books receive at least 3 1st class reviews.

"," We’ve got thousands of books in the children's section alone. We have to be able to say that these are good products. Reviews really do help sales - more than 90% of sales come from reviews. We use Bookable, a software application, to collect reviews. We take a random sample of 10 reviews, and if there is any correlation between the number of reviews and the number of sales, we are keen to get as many reviews in as possible.

Publisher B We have to admit we're not a big fan of the idea of editorialising book reviews. Books are meant to be a reflection of the author's opinion, not a piece of advertising for a book company. We don't have a position on the effectiveness of reviews of books. We have a separate unit for selling books, and we collect a sample of online reviews.

Publisher C We are big fans of editorialising reviews of books. We put our review into the ""real world"" in a way that can only be described as editorial. This ""real world"" review makes us feel like we're putting ""us"" in the book (and making it look like our book) rather than just another copy of the book. It also helps us to ensure that we have a wide audience of users of our online bookstore to talk about our products.

Publisher D We only have a small team who review the books. Our objective is to have the best possible recommendations. We also want to ensure"," It's the thing we make coffee out of. There is a small minority of books out there that doesn't get the good reviews so there is nothing to do with it other than hope you get lucky. For books that do get the good reviews, the more eyes on the product the better. This year the publisher we work with asked for 30+ 5 star reviews, in 2018 the books that had that treatment went on to do slightly better than average - I think we can attribute that to the increase in reviews. Some of the best sellers in our list did not have many 5 star reviews but still did quite well. The data shows if a book gets 5 star reviews it is over 3 times more likely to go on to top 40-60 spot in the week following publication, this is what we use in our advertising and marketing mix. Also the data from last few years shows if a book gets 2-4 reviews it's over 20% more likely to go to number 1 spot the week following publication - so it is pretty easy to understand that if you write a book people want to buy you will get reviews. The author of a book can do anything from getting a good number of 5 star reviews to getting 0, but if you as an author write a good book that is interesting, relevant and useful to the learner and has some nice graphics you are likely to get a good number of good reviews and it will help you to sell more books as people who like the book are more likely"," We use a combination of sales data, social media activity and customer feedback to determine if a book is a success or failure. The reviews have an ever-increasing impact on the sales of books. The number of review copies given to a book when it is published is a strong predictor of its future sales. 
- Publisher B Reviews are an important element of the sales process for Publishers but they do not necessarily guarantee commercial success for a book. As a publisher we take on books which have been well received by the public for example, the number of books awarded a high profile award such as the Carnegie Medal, a highly regarded award for books about animals. However, we cannot guarantee a commercial success for a book if it has received a poor review from customers. 
- Publisher C Reviews of a book are only one part of the sales equation. We also consider the interest generated on social media for a book by customers who have either reviewed the book or purchased a copy from the platform. 
- Publisher D We have not been able to find any evidence that reviews of a book affect its commercial success. We have seen a number of highly successful best-sellers without any positive reviews. The reviews are a good feedback mechanism for customers and the general public to provide their opinions on new books, but cannot guarantee commercial success for a book. 

The five leading British publishers of books: Penguin Random House, Harper Collins, Macmillan, Thomas Nelson & Sons and David F"," Books are an important part of our lives so there’s an expectation that we will have read and enjoyed them. We would rather have a review that’s positive than one that’s negative, because the former tells a much better story. Reviews increase sales - even without the inclusion of the book in the weekly Sunday Times bestseller list. When our books do become bestsellers, publishers will do everything they can to ensure the reviews are favourable. It’s in publishers’ best interests to get as many reviews as possible and we have seen first-party apps like Readdle that enable us to manage the process, but a lot can be done with third-party review platforms too. We have started experimenting with D2L and it works quite well, although I’m not sure how effective our reviews are, as the students have to log in to the Readdle account to submit the review. D2L only allows you to submit one review every ten minutes so we haven’t had the opportunity to submit many reviews. We have also found that if the book is more popular than we expected, the students may submit reviews after the fact, even if they haven’t finished reading the book yet. In summary, reviews are absolutely key for us and we invest heavily in both first-party and third-party review management solutions. Ultimately, reviews are still the best form of marketing.

The story we are looking for focuses on a specific type of weathervane: the so-called ‘windsock’ which is a traditional design that represents either the shape of a fish or a sailing ship. 

The writer must use two images to illustrate this type of weathervane: 

- A typical windsock made from straw or other materials;
- A windsock made from wood (preferably English oak). 

While the writer may use other types of weathervane designs in the story, the image of a traditional windsock should appear at least twice within the text, once on first mention and again on second mention.

# Write the first paragraph of your story:

Graham Smith runs a workshop where he creates designs for hand-cut weathervanes. He is one of the few people in the country who still makes these traditional weathervanes.


“So, what’s the story about?” asked my son, Jonny, as we were walking into the workshop next to our hotel. 

“Well, there is a type of weathervane called a ‘windsock’ that represents either a"," 

From wood or stone, there are many different shapes and sizes of weathervanes. The key to good weathervane design is to take your inspiration from the natural world around us and to incorporate the principles of aerodynamics. Graham has several different designs but our favourite has to be the Red Rum. The Red Rum weathervane is striking and elegant and was made from wood from a fallen Redwood tree. It is very strong and well built, with features such as a bracket at the top of the vane to support a flag.

We often see the Red Rum being used as a prominent feature on country houses or large gardens. 

Graham’s workmanship is exceptional and the price of an individually hand-made weathervane such as this is quite amazing. 

Graham is a unique person with a rare ability to understand the requirements of his customers and to respond with a beautifully crafted design. We would recommend booking a visit to see his workshop.

The Red Rum is one of Graham’s most requested designs. It is very strong, well built and elegant.  A timber vane from a Redwood tree and was very carefully carved by hand. The price is impressive but the skill and craftsmanship on display is"," “I like to take artistic licence with history,” he explains. “My designs follow the spirit of the times when I was growing up. I want to reflect the changes I see around me and my own sense of adventure.” 

Graham has trained as an artisan from an early age but his inspiration came from attending a BBC restoration course aged 17. At that time he was offered the chance to restore a weathervane that had belonged to his great-grandfather and had been abandoned in a field. Over the last 20 years he has amassed a collection of old wooden structures that provide inspiration for his designs.

“It’s the people and history that interest me. It’s all about the craftsmanship,” he says. “A good design will stand the test of time and will be appreciated for centuries to come.” He likes to base his designs on historical examples but has also developed his own innovative designs, one of which features a man’s head on a woman’s body. “That one is a bit of fun,” he says. 

Graham works with a range of materials and in his workshop, which has a well-stocked tool and parts cabinet, he is able to offer a variety of services, from restoration to painting, engraving and gilding. He works exclusively with wooden structures. He estimates that there are around 3,000 people in the UK who make their own hand-made weathervanes, some of","


In ancient Egypt, the making of weathervanes was an essential part of the culture. They had the task of protecting their owner’s home or business from negative influences from the surrounding environment. During the rainy season, these small metal symbols of the gods were set up outside in the temple garden in order to bring rain to the people inside. These simple devices have enabled many cultures throughout history to make their living. The Egyptian god Horus was depicted riding a horse, wearing the sun disc, and holding in his hand a flail. The flail is what we know today as a weathervane.  


The ancient Egyptians were very good at making a wide variety of artifacts. One of the best-preserved examples of their craftsmanship is the beautiful stone temple doors. One of the things that made these doors unique from most others was their beautiful engravings. The Egyptians had a unique system of incising and inlaying the precious metals. This process was time-consuming and very painstaking. The door frames were left without their doors until someone in the next town would pay to have these doors fitted. It was from this system that the idea of making a replacement door became an affordable luxury.


The Egyptians were also very good at imbuing their artifacts with symbols of protection, not just for their homes but for their entire communities. This can be seen in both their tombs and temples. Egyptian artisans carved these"," He has made vanes for churches and pubs, and some of the people who commissioned his vanes are former customers from previous years. 

As you might expect from a craft that has been practised for hundreds of years, there are significant differences in the techniques used by Graham and his workshopmates. One thing is clear: they all like to use a great deal of wood in their designs and their vanes are no exception. A large pile of wood is at the front of Graham’s workshop: this is where the vanes are made. They begin by carving a block of wood into the shape of their design. The design is then cut out using an axe. Graham is also well-versed in metalwork and some of the more unusual vanes are made using stainless steel. 

One design features a swan swimming upstream. The swan’s neck and head stick out above the water and it carries a crown of ivy on its head. It is the swan that stands out here. In the design, the swan is facing upstream towards the church and the crown of ivy is held high in the air. The head of the swan is in profile. The other design features a ram with the head in profile. These vanes have a stone ball as the headpiece. 

In the middle of the workshop, an old pulley has been restored and stands proudly in a corner. The pulley is a mechanism by which rope is"," He explains that he chooses to do this rather than using prefabricated weathervane stocks in order to have direct control over the quality of his products. He uses a combination of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing techniques. He takes technical drawings and uses 3D computer software to design the products on a computer. After creating 3D models, the models are printed using a 3D printer. He then makes detailed measurements and cuts the weathervane from a solid metal plate. Each weathervane is then individually treated to achieve the desired finish. The process can take several days. When his work is complete he leaves it to dry overnight. The next day he uses a grindstone to polish the finished product. This is one of the advantages of using a weathervane: it can be fixed to the top of a building or pole without any additional supports or hardware, as the pole or building serves as the support. The craft of making weathervanes is not restricted to England. In Denmark, for example, a similar craft known as  ”sløgting”  has survived for centuries.  Sløgting is a Danish word that means “slinging”, as slings were the ancient devices used for casting metal objects. Slings are still widely used today to launch pebbles, balls and rocks.  This Danish craft is not restricted to Scandinavia; it has also been popularised in other European countries. Another form of outdoor craft is"
" We knew that 95 percent of the kids under eighteen who smoked either tried to quit or would have succeeded if we provided access to professional cessation assistance. We knew this because the kids' behavior had been studied. And, we lied to them.

It didn't matter that none of this had any relation to whether kids would buy our products or whether they would quit smoking. We couldn't persuade them. We lied so that we could persuade ourselves.


The article continues: 

What the industry really needed was to convince the kids that it was trying to help them, to tell them that it really, truly wanted to see them smoke fewer cigarettes. It wanted to provide them with information, access to help, a chance to try its products, and most of all, a better future. What it got instead was even more deceitful marketing, a push toward a less healthy alternative lifestye, and kids who saw through the smoke and were denied the chance to quit.

""So you were underestimating kids' ability to perceive the industry's true intention?""  

""That's exactly right,"" he agreed. ""And even though we were targeting adults, we made them think we were targeting kids.""  

---

Based on the above passage, what is the industry's true intention?  

""The tobacco industry spends billions of dollars a year marketing to kids.""


That is indeed the industry's true intention. To be sure, they market to adults as well, but the overwhelming majority of their marketing is targeted at teenagers.


Note 1: the author is not saying that the industry manipulates children's brains in order to sell their products. Instead, he regrets that the industry denied that it was targeting teenagers and believed that targeting adults would have a greater effect on kids. Thus, he thinks that the industry was probably overestimating the children's ability to judge the truthfulness of advertising claims.


Note 2: This passage also shows that the adjective teenagers can have different, nuanced meanings in different contexts. For example, the ""three most advertised brands of cigarettes"" may be generic names, while the ""kids under eighteen who smoked"" may include teenagers who are not smokers themselves, but who observe others smoking and thus become hooked.


Note 3: This passage reminds us of the famous T"," We spent millions trying to convince these kids that we could sell them cigarettes if we would only show them cute animals on TV or in the movies. We spent millions more making sure that the industry funded high-quality research. And we went to all the conferences to learn how to market to teenagers!

Consider the words and sentences used in this passage, and summarize the key arguments presented by each side.

One argument is that the tobacco industry spent millions of dollars trying to convince kids that they could quit smoking by watching cute animals on TV or in the movies, and that the industry advertised only to teenagers.

The other argument is that the tobacco industry understood that it was targeting kids because they spent millions of dollars trying to quit smoking and the industry funded research to convince kids they could stop smoking.

It's out there trying to get them hooked and keep them hooked by telling them there's nothing to stop them from living a happy life.

" When we arrived at Mr Jaggers's office I noticed two large cages on wheels in the corner of the room. He greeted me and took a seat across from me. The room was dimly lit. After a few moments a very old man entered the room, followed by a younger man who was similarly dressed. The old man said in a deep, serious voice ""I have a confession to make"". The clerk asked, ""Go on"". ""I came to London for the sole purpose of seeing this solicitor"". ""Mr Jaggers"".

I could sense that the old man was nervous. He clearly had a lot on his mind. I decided to share my story with him, that I had travelled all the way from my town to see Mr Jaggers. He listened to me with great interest, asking me questions about my journey and my destination. After about an hour I realised the old man had gone into his room to speak to his guest. After about ten minutes I heard the old man speaking with his guest in a"," I have never seen a court. There are rows of chairs facing a podium and rows of chairs behind it where the audience sits. There are benches in the aisles. People shout, lawyers argue, and judges rule. I waited for nearly an hour but no Mr Jaggers came. The clerk showed me a map of the building. We walked down a long hallway with offices on both sides. Some had names over the doors but none had Mr Jaggers' name. The clerk led me to a large open office with a desk in the middle and a large window looking out into the street. A large black man sat behind the desk. He wore a large wig and a suit of a sort my father wore to work. Mr Jaggers asked me to sit in a chair in front of his desk and the clerk left us alone. I looked around. There were a few books on the desk and a large painting of a harbour scene on the wall. Mr Jaggers spoke. ""Please tell me what you know of Mr Jaggers' work."" I decided to try to impress Mr Jaggers by answering his questions in detail. ""I've seen Mr Jaggers work a few times. It's always been on the case of the month or in the news because of the biggest cases. He's always done brilliant work."" ""You are very perceptive, I was sure you would be able to answer my questions,"" Mr Jaggers complimented me. ""Thank you. My father is"," I was a little uncomfortable in the dark, but Jaggers's clerk reassured me by saying that Mr Jaggers always preferred to have his consultations in the evening. 

This is a very short story, which could be read in less than 30 minutes. It follows a young man who travels to London to meet a solicitor who is in court. The story is about the journey and how the man felt about being in the dark room. It is a story which will interest students of English, or lawyers, or those who are interested in the legal system and how it operates.


The story begins with the young man at the train station. He then heads to the court in Mr Jaggers's town. When he arrives, a clerk greets him and takes him to a dark room. The young man is a little surprised, as this is not typical for a consultation. He sits down in front of the window and his clerk closes the door. For the next 20 minutes, the clerk does not say anything. He just stands by the door and looks outside. When the man gets up to leave, he is a little confused, as he was not aware that the consultation would take place in the evening. But as he walks out, he notices that the street is nearly deserted. He realises that the clerk must have given him a different direction to the court. He is a little surprised, but still happy to have found a new direction for the consultation.


The story","

A:

The book is named, appropriately enough, ""Journey to the Capital."" The story is about a young boy, whose journey to the capital took about five hours. When he arrived at Mr Jaggers's office, he was told that Mr Jaggers was in court and had left word that he should wait in Mr Jaggers's room. The boy went to Mr Jaggers's room, where he was informed that Mr Jaggers was in fact not in the office and could not see him. He was informed that Mr Jaggers was actually in court and that the matter was likely to take some time. 

The young boy was frustrated by this news. He quickly grew tired of waiting, and when Mr Jaggers returned asked if there was any news of his case. Mr Jaggers responded that he was indeed in court, and would be for some time. The boy was now very worried. He said to himself, ""If Mr Jaggers is in court for several hours, I do not want to stay here! I want to leave as soon as possible. I wonder if there is another way to get to the capital?"" 
The boy consulted the books Mr Jaggers had on his desk. One of the books suggested that if he walked three doors down the hall, he could find a window through which he could see the capital. He did this, and was astonished to see that the capital was not far off, and that he could return home"," I tried the door but it was locked. I heard the clerk's voice from somewhere else. She was saying I didn't have an appointment but he insisted. Finally the door opened and I saw Mr Jaggers standing before me. ""Ah! David! It's good to see you. Come in and sit down.""

Mr Jaggers had a leather bound book in his hand and I sat down. ""Well. How was your journey?""

""Uneventful, Mr Jaggers.""

""Good. That's good. What can I do for you David?""

I explained that my family needed my help and asked if he had a book of wills.

Mr Jaggers laughed. ""I wouldn't be surprised if I did. Let me see if I can find it for you.""

He moved over to a desk where there was a pile of dusty tomes. He opened a book at the page he was looking for and handed the book to me. I thanked him and started to leave.

""David, wait."" Mr Jaggers called after me.

I turned around and Mr Jaggers was now standing at the window looking outside. I asked him what he was looking at.

""Just a moment. I think I may have seen your wife earlier today. She had an old fashioned suit with a grey overcoat on.""

I was confused. How could she have arrived in court with an old"," As he opened the door, the light from the window fell on to a chair by the wall. I saw a small desk with a lamp on it. I looked around the room. It was quite large and very messy. On the wall behind the desk, there was a map with arrows and the capital city marked. Mr Jaggers was standing with a bunch of papers in his hand. He said ""Sit down"" and I sat down on the chair. He looked at me and smiled. ""How are you today"", he asked. I smiled back and said "" fine"" and then I began to look at the papers in his hand.

The clerk opened the door to a small room and we both entered. He shut the door behind us and the room became dark. The clerk turned on the light. Mr Jaggers was seated at a table on which were a legal tablet and a quill pen. A short distance away, Mr Stamper, a solicitor, was standing. We shook hands and Mr Jaggers said, ""Good morning, Mr Stamper."" ""Good morning, Mr Jaggers."" ""Would you mind introducing yourself to Mr Stamper?"" I said. I introduced myself and shook his hand. Mr Jaggers cleared his throat and looked at Mr Stamper, who returned his gaze steadily. Then Mr Jaggers said, ""Mr Stamper, this is Mr Kieran McDonough. He is a student of English Literature and will soon graduate from university. I hope you have not wasted much time and that we can get started."" ""Not at all, Mr Jaggers."" ""Very good."" And we got down to business. Mr Stamper took out a file and spread it before Mr Jaggers, who began to look through the documents. I looked through the dictionary and thesaurus and memorised a few phrases.  
I learned that the word ""warrant"" meant"
" The temperature on this warm summer day is climbing. Richard Nerurkar is struggling a bit. He’s only just started training for the London marathon and is just starting to build up his endurance. The temperature and altitude are starting to take their toll on him. Despite his best efforts he is slowing. When the call comes for him to run the next 10.8 kilometres, Richard is feeling distinctly less than his best. He does as he's told and begins the slow but steady climb up the mountain. He's not sure what's going on, but then suddenly, to his astonishment, he bursts into full throttle sprint mode. He runs and he runs. He runs so far so fast, so fast, so fast, that he loses all sense of his surroundings. He runs for so long he completely forgets his own name. It's all he can do to stop himself from crying out, 'Look! Look at me, I am running the 10.8 kilometres to theKenyans’ 10,000-metre goal! Look at me, I am running! I am running! I am running!' Just when he thinks he can't go any faster he bursts through the 10,000-metre barrier, well, 10,876.38metres beyond his target, with a whopping 38 seconds to spare, earning himself a warm welcome back in his village and leading the Kenyans to victory.


The above is a fictitious story about"," The journey takes two to three weeks. 
From their camp in the rolling green hills the Kenyans are ready. For months they have been living on little more than potatoes and maize porridge with only the sparse winter supplies to sustain them during their long cold runs. It's been cold up there but Nerurkar knows his body. He is used to the lowlanders' high-pressure sports drinks and chocolate bars. 
  When the Kenya team needs him to run fast he's ready. His coach has fitted him with a special suit with an inner layer of insulating material to protect his core body temperature from the cold. 
  With their headgear on and with the starter's pistol fired at the starting line Nerurkar starts off fast. He is at the back of the pack but in no time at all he's challenging the leaders. In the heat of the race he hears the cheer of a familiar voice. The coach is there at his side and when the shout comes over the radio that Nerurkar has broken the world record for the 10,000-metre distance he celebrates with his team-mates. The next day's headlines in the global sports news carry the same banner headlines and Nerurkar is lionized in the British and Kenyan press. 
  After the race, when he has recovered from his jet lag and has had time to digest the honor, Nerurkar meets the coach. 
  The coach shrugs"," The temperature starts at freezing and the air starts to thin considerably as one heads into the highlands. When the track reaches an elevation of 3600 metres, it forks into two tracks. The steep southern route climbs 2000 metres in just six hours, the northern route is slower going but leads to a higher campsite at 4500 metres. 

Once everyone is settled in, a signal is raised and all the runners start at once. As the Kenyans' track leads off to the right, Richard turns left. In another mile the track forks again; to the right is the south-bound main track, to the left is a side-route to the lower campsite. It is faster going, but everyone is in a hurry to get to the top. 

At 5am the entire pack is on the track to the south. Richard is last out of the lead group, but once on the down-track he begins to reel as the effort starts to take it toll on his body. He runs at just a trot for a few miles before slowing to a trot again; still the pack is gaining on him. By the time he hits the down-track the main group will have crossed the 3000 metre mark, but Richard’s pace will not be enough to catch them. 

It is now late morning, and the pace has reduced further as all the runners are starting to get the requisite four hours of sleep the Kenyan runners depend on","

Upon entering the camp the Briton quickly realizes this is no village school for village children. The huts are modern and well equipped, the residents - mostly young men - dressed in sharp white shorts and t-shirts and all wearing footware. In the center of the camp is a huge tent, canvas and thatch however, its interior is largely empty.

""Wow! Is this the altitude training camp of the Kenyan runners?"" Nerurkar asks the young men who approach. 

The answer comes back - in high-pitched Kiwi accent: 

""You got it, Sire! It's the Mount Kenya Runner's Camp! ""

Nerurkar enters the tent where a man in shorts and a vest is working at a small table. The man jumps up to greet the runner: 

""Ah, Sire! It's good to see you again! The camp has been buzzing with excitement this morning with the news that the top runners of your country are visiting for the first time in years. We were wondering if you would be coming!""

""Well, I don't know about ""buzzing with excitement,"" replies Nerurkar as he examines some maps and notes the planned route on the page.

""You have to come! The local runners have been training for months, and this will be their biggest ever attempt to break the record for the highest achieved. 

""No","

As Nerurkar runs along the road, he is met by Kenyan coach Moses Kipchoge. Kipchoge points to a high-tech biomechanics suite at the camp, where Nerurkar's body is measured and analysed.

Kipchoge explains that Nerurkar is set to make history. The 22-year-old Kenyan who will run in the London Marathon in April will become the first Briton ever to break the 15-minute barrier. 

Nerurkar agrees to have his body measured, as the team believes it will help him improve his training. When he steps into the biomechanics suite he is amazed to see that his body is covered in a layer of sweat. 

Kipchoge shows Nerurkar how his body moves when he runs. He explains that the more he runs, the more his body adapts. Kipchoge says they are now working on a mechanical change that will allow Nerurkar to run five kilometres in less than six minutes. 

As Nerurkar leaves the biomechanics suite, he feels more energised and raring to go than ever. In two months he will run at the Kenyan marathon trials and then his journey to the starting line of the London Marathon will begin.

A2


This story was written with A"," Richard follows the marked track for the first four miles until the trail bends left into the thick bush. Ten minutes later he arrives at the base of the mountain and starts to scale the rocky hillside. The route quickly becomes steeper and rockier. The next two miles lead up to a 3000 feet summit where the trail becomes less steep. From here Richard can survey his Kenyan destination below. Continuing on the steeper path Richard enters a meadow at the base of the final peak and can see an open valley below filled with small white houses and the Suez Canal. After a brief respite he returns to the difficult climb with steeply cut steps. It takes him ten hours to get to the summit where he joins the other runners on the final approach. When they finally reach the top, they greet one another with hugs and tears of joy. 
Richard climbs the mountain a thousand times in his mind but each time the pain shoots through his shin making it hard for him to continue. To his surprise, the pain has only increased in strength from the climb. But he soon discovers that the Kenyan high-altitude training camp has been more of a workout than he expected. His body and spirit are ready for the challenge and the altitude. He has trained harder and more effectively than any of his competitors. The race will be won on the top of Mount Kenya where the crowds will witness the Kenyan and European athletes competing for the coveted rainbow jersey."," 

The peak is a popular destination for mountaineers because of the views. Richard knows the peak is there, he just needs to find it. At first he thinks he has reached the summit after seeing all the climbers gathered.  

However, the next morning he realises he is still on the glacier and he can't figure out why. It's then that he realises he has been lost in the mountain's maze of gullies, channelled by heavy snowfall.

After a few hours of further struggle, Richard emerges onto a snow plateau and sees the summit in the distance. His knees ache from crouching for so long but the view beyond the horizon makes it worth it.

A young climber spots him from the plateau and tells him they have found a way down. Richard agrees, but before he starts the descent the climber asks him a question that shocks him: can you run the 10000 metres? Richard says of course, but the climber says you will need to run fast to make up for the miles you have lost on the way up. The two climb down from the plateau and make their way back to Nairobi. 

Richard is back in the running, although he would be happy with a second place which might be good enough for the next world championships.

" But, the heart and soul of this exhibition is a small but exquisite yacht called 'The Westerman'. Built by Eric Gill (of 'The Last of the Summerini' fame) it is based on the classic 'Ford' yacht built for Prince Aly Khan of Jordan in 1968. Eric Gill incorporated many of the classic features of his design into this one boat. In particular, he chose to build around an open deck-area, the transom at which the boat has been caulk protected for many years. The raised swim platform (which does actually give a bit of swimming space) is a'step' design, while the transom incorporates a modern digital helm. Eric Gill also made the decision to retain the superstructure of the Prince Aly Khan, but to replace its 'fuselage'. The result is a beautiful interpretation of the Ford design, with none of the modern compromises which have bedevilled recent design. Indeed, The Westerman is everything that Tom Cunliffe (of the Ford Yachts company) would wish to be; elegant, timeless and with technology of which contemporary yachtsmen can take full advantage. The Westerman is now on the market for £4.25 million. And it's ours for the asking.

  * Eric Gill's design for the Prince Aly Khan based on the classic Ford yacht is the heart and soul of this exhibition.

  * The Westerman incorporates modern technology of"," Since then, yacht builders have been able to incorporate the lessons they had learned from working in metals and creating moulds from scratch. This has meant that it's now possible to create sleek, modern boats with traditional rigging, hulls and superstructures. Examples abound in the exhibition - notably 'Black and White II' of Triumph Yachts, a small single-masted yacht with a very different profile to its ancestor, which came through the show. The hull-shape revolution and the corresponding wealth of research which has followed have also proven extremely influential in other industries, such as aerospace. These days, many of the leading aerospace companies are designing and manufacturing boats. From carbon fiber technology to improve strength to mold-making, the hull-shape revolution has produced many useful innovations which have positively impacted numerous industries. In short, the old boat designs have redefined what it is possible to achieve. It's all the more remarkable when you consider that many of the old boat builders in this country are in their 90's and 100's. But Tom Cunliffe - designer of arguably the most popular yacht in the world, 'The Westerman' - has lived long enough to see the hull-shape revolution reach fruition. As he says: It's an old idea in a new age. It's been a good life's work. The boat builder is a man whose career spans more than 50 years, from building his first sloop as a young man"," And the hulls are fast: some of the new boats go like the Devil. But the Westerman has stayed true to Tom's best boat design. It combines a traditional, narrow, V-shaped hull with an aft-cockpit and a modern, bulbous fin on the very front of the boat. This combination gives the Westerman a speed which rivals any of the modern boats while remaining easy to manage. There's also space for the crew and comfort: all the seats have their ownStorage space.  	
 
Tom's design has proved popular: it is at the heart of a group of luxury yachts being built in the UK. And while it will never be cheap, he has managed to price it competitively with modern boats. It's a good choice for families and couples who want space, comfort and good speed. It also comes with a free warranty for a further decade. Tom thinks the Westerman looks great and it has lots of practical advantages. And that's why his boat is on sale in all the major yacht markets. 

Tom's boat design is a good example of combining old and new to achieve a successful boat. The Westerman is a fine example of combining traditional hull shape with modern technology. It looks good, is fast and will prove popular in the luxury market. 

THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS is a good story for A2 learners. It features Tom's boat design and explains how it combines"," The revolutionary new boat hulls were built to an all new set of rules. They could be more than half filled with liquid and be stable in all weathers, they had wider beams to reduce roll, and more high tech systems, sensors and controls to make the boat easy to drive and safer to operate. As a result they were cheaper to produce and built faster than the old craft with which people still used to live for many years. As a result of the demand that created, shipyards raced to build the new designs, often re-using existing fabrication facilities with all the benefits that entailed. New boats had new engines too, with higher tech fuel injection, electronic ignition, and better cooling for the more complex electronic components. The hulls had all the modern comforts: more spacious cabins and head with lie flat berths that were very popular with younger crew. It was an age of plenty, prosperity, and while the old wooden boats that were built alongside started to look tired and even rusty, the new boats were everywhere, all shapes and sizes, and very impressive. It was a good time to be a boatbuilder, and many of the old boatyards expanded their businesses and were inundated with new business. But Tom Cunliffe was not satisfied. He had long been thinking about the boat he had seen at the show a few weeks ago: the old Westerman, which had last seen the waters of Loch Ness five years before. The"," The revolutionary new keel and rigs that sailed the world have been copied by ever-larger yachts and ferried over treacherous seaways by ever-more-efficient engines. There is one yacht, however, that blends the best of both worlds: the old with the new. Tom Cunliffe's The Westerman is powered by a simple yet efficient diesel engine and sails in the ancient, familiar hull shape of the wooden boat. The Westerman has set out to demonstrate the virtues of the traditional hull shape, but in doing so has created a highly evolved, elegant object that is elegant and efficient. The Westerman has certainly caught the spirit of the times and is garnering plenty of admirers. In fact, one observer has already created a new category for this elegant but outdated boat: modern classic. 

Compare and contrast The Westerman with another yacht that incorporates elements of both new and old boat designs.


THE WESTERMAN

The Westerman, by Tom Cunliffe, is an elegant wooden boat that incorporates elements of both new and old boat designs. The Westerman has a wooden hull shape that's been in use since the 1700s. However, the Westerman incorporates revolutionary new keel and rigs that are descended from the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago.

The Westerman has a simple yet efficient diesel engine. This allows the Westerman"," But all these sleek boats are built around a core of traditional timbers and hull planks. Which leaves me feeling a little left out. After all, boats have been my life since I was a child. And that life would be nothing without technology. I love modern technology: my iPad, my iPhone and the laptop I use to teach children how to sail. But what if I wanted to continue sailing? I might feel a little left out if I had to give up my modern toys too. I imagine the Westerman, as my father calls it, might feel a little incomplete. I hope he is not right. He did put it into practice. Over the past year he has rebuilt much of the Westerman with old oak and pine timbers. He is proud of this craft. I hope he is not too disappointed that modern technology does not run entirely within his own boat. (THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS, by William Styron)

The following sentence contains a sentence per page ratio of 12.5: "," At first glance this is a happy marriage of two divergent styles. The elegant, sleek lines of a contemporary yacht contrast with the flared hulls and bulbous noses of older designs. This is the 1960’s, one of the great boat styles of the modern era, popular for their light weight and excellent performance in small quarters. The Westerman, however, has been meticulously updated with every modern technology to take full advantage of this century’s advances.

The most radical change is the design of the keel. The ancient V-shape is replaced by a new concave curvature. Tom says this has made the Westerman “the easiest boat to sail” without requiring “any more rudder input than a dinghy requires”. The new shape also provides greater stability at speed. The mast is also an unusual “top-mast-perched bow rider”, providing added stability and making it easy to control at speed.

Sinks have also changed. To combat the “hazards of boat travel” and to help lower the centre of gravity, the Westerman’s old metal sinks have been replaced with high-tech, self-contained resin sinks powered by a 12v battery.

The design has been stripped down to its essential elements – the hull, designed around a bulbous mid-ship section, and the rig, which consists of a large, high freeboard genoa and jib – “as simple and direct as a"

A kangaroo rat is a small marsupial which looks like a cross between a koala and a possum but does not have its four legs. Kangaroo rats are found in the rainforests of eastern Queensland. Quokkas are small marsupials which live in the savannahs of south-eastern New South Wales and Queensland. 

There are many interesting species of hedgehog such as the kangaroo rat and the quokkas.  Even though there are many different species of hedgehog, they all have two traits in common; they roll into a tight ball when attacked and their spines point outwards. This could be a useful trait in defense of their species.


Hedgehog 1: The quokkas are small marsupials which live in the savannahs of south-eastern New South Wales and Queensland. While they are very defensive and will snap the spines of any intruding animal, they are not as defenseless as they first appear.

He was very happy, living in the warm sunshine basking in the sunshine, eating tasty fruit and rolling into a ball when threatened. Then one day he felt a sharp pain in his leg. He thought it was from eating the wrong thing, but then a second pain set in. He looked down and his leg was on fire. He thrashed about and tried to kick out at the spines which were now sticking into his skin. What could he do? He remembered his Uncle Jack who could speak to animals. Jack was a very wise man and could help him. So he crawled over to the telephone which was on the windowsill. As he crawled he could feel the burning pain in his leg become less intense. Soon it had almost completely gone. He got to the phone and after thinking about what to do, he tried to call for help. His friend, the badger, answered. ""Jack, it's me, Hedgehog! I'm in trouble! Can you help me?"" Then he heard a barking noise in the distance. He looked out of the window and saw a large dog coming his way, sniffing intently at the window. ""Hello, Mr Hedgehog!

The story I came up with is set in the Wilds of the planet Wilds, which is located between America and Australia, neither country is aware of its existence, except for a few explorers who have stumbled across it.

The main character of the story, Dolly, is a spiny-tailed hedgehog who has been hiding in the Wilds for ten years and only revealed herself when a spaceship crashed in the nearby forest and a group of marooned humans appeared.

Dolly was lucky enough to survive the crash and soon learned the rest of the story: a group of marooned humans had also survived the crash and now lived in huddles, hunting and gathering food to survive.

Dolly quickly picked up the English language and learnt to hunt, kill and scare rabbits and other small creatures with her spiny tail in order to survive.


After a few years, Dolly discovered a hidden lake in the Wilds and settled there, spending most days basking in the sunshine and searching for food in the nearby forests.

While the Industrial Revolution created new sources of power to fuel machine tools blacksmiths maintained a similar role because the need to forge weapons had long provided them with a high proportion of output. 
In contrast with doctors, priests and astrologers blacksmiths have never enjoyed the same status because they have never been able to produce more than a limited quantity of goods that people need. The need to forge weapons has simply never been as pressing an issue for people as it is today. 
By 2050 the Industrial Revolution had eliminated the need for blacksmiths. Because of this they too fell into disrepute and became prostitutes. 
In 2053 a woman is dying from complications of pregnancy in a run down district of London. When the coughing and shivering have abated she makes her way to the nearby town dump where she finds a tin of rat poison and an empty bottle of whisky.
She takes the bottle of whisky with her back to the old neighborhood. After some rummaging through a skip she comes across a spade, some rope and an old oil lamp. Using the spade she digs a hole in which to lay out the rat poison. Taking the lamp, she goes back to the dump and looks for the perfect place in which to lay out the poison and where she can get a good view of the dump. She positions the lamp on the dump and takes the bottle of whisky with her.
When"," Over the years the craft has come under attack from numerous sources including automation but it is still an exciting and dangerous profession. One man who refuses to accept the decline of his trade and refuses to adapt is Joe Bloggs who last week was found guilty of murder for killing a customer who rejected his forged weapon. During the trial the judge spoke of how a master forger once commented that while Joe’s crime was heinous it was not so bad given that the criminal mind is uncontrollable and the blacksmith could not be blamed for the actions of a madman. Bloggs’s defence lawyer argued that the blacksmiths craft had lost its craftsmanship due to automation and that Joe’s crime was not murder at all but the result of buyer’s remorse. In conclusion the jury found Joe Bloggs guilty but recommended that he be given a six-year prison sentence with the condition that he serve half his sentence in Callow.

“They Call Me V-8” by","  When the Industrial Revolution reached North America blacksmiths began to offer more services such as lathe turning and machine welding which helped to create a new industrial order.  Blacksmithing continued to enjoy a status as an artisanal craft and is still practiced today in many communities however today's blacksmiths are also responsible for creating weapons and machines that have a profound affect on human experience and therefore are employed by governments for defence and in industry for both defence and civilian use.   Many of the most influential artists including Pablo Picasso and Warhol valued a blacksmiths work and blacksmiths have often been painters and sculptors.  Because of their artistic merit many cities throughout the world have blacksmiths on their own walls.  This has led to a blacksmith being described as a ""Statue of Liberty for the Gut"".  While the work of blacksmiths has a profound effect on the world around them they are also members of the human family and their families go to blacksmiths for weddings and funerals as well as for maintaining their own equipment.  

A2. For Pablo Picasso who valued a blacksmiths work, and Warhol who valued a blacksmiths work, and as an artist who valued a blacksmiths work, Picasso and Warhol, and families who go to blacksmiths for weddings and funerals, and for maintaining their own equipment, and for having their own statues of Liberty on their wall, therefore a blacksmith"," Their craft had been honed to such an extent that blacksmiths could be relied on to provide a level of service so precise it could only be achieved through the application of science. 

However, in times past, blacksmiths fell out of favour as factories began producing goods at a fraction of the cost of blacksmiths. In more modern times, they have risen in esteem yet they remain only men whose sole function is to craft and for whom the word science is somewhat suspect. This was never more apparent than when a fire broke out at one of London’s largest and most prestigious blacksmiths. Although the fire quickly spread through the forges and destroyed much of the factory the blacksmiths who perished were well past their prime and so could not have saved the forge from total destruction. As the inferno engulfed them they were left naked, shivering and gasping for air as the wind whistled through charred holes in their clothing. 

Ironically the blacksmiths who perished were not the ones whose name would have gone down in history. The name of the blacksmith in question had been applied to someone else and the man who was ironically named for his craft had instead spent decades making up stories in an attempt to compensate for the failures of his hands. The fire had not been fatal to him but his failure to extinguish the flames had left his clothes in a state of disrepair and so he had been obliged to don","  The ancient Egyptians believed that the god Atum created the Universe with blacksmiths as his first labouring of creation. In Greek mythology, smiths attended theurgists who performed magical ritual cures. In medieval times blacksmiths were viewed as specialists of divination and astrology and many believed they were also able to control and influence the weather. 

While these days we tend to view blacksmiths as craftsmen rather than priests of the gods their skills have continued to be sought after in modern times.  One can still hire a blacksmith to create a custom-made sword a testament to their enduring skill. 

In the early 21st century the blacksmith is a specialist in metalsworking who creates custom-designed metal items from both raw metals and forged metals. They also repair and maintain a range of machinery used in metalworking including: 

forging presses
wheel lathes 

The blacksmith's craft demands the user shape metal using simple tools but due to the precision involved this requires a high degree of manual dexterity and hand eye co-ordination.  It is also important that the smith has a good understanding of metallurgy because they will be creating custom-made items so understanding the different properties and characteristics of metals is essential. The blacksmith has to be able to read, understand and follow simple instructions to create their items. They often rely on apprentices to perform smaller tasks but only the blacksmith will know how"," The Industrial Revolution changed all this and today blacksmiths (along with carpenters and joiners) are less likely to be regarded as healers than are accountants. 

The text is 'Through the ages the blacksmith has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination. The men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen.

Iron has the ability to cut through any other material with its sharpness and as early humans discovered they could make a wide range of tools and weapons from it they began to evolve into the specialists they are today.

This evolution is still ongoing with today's blacksmiths still honing their art and experimenting with the properties of the steel in their forges. 

While there are thousands of blacksmiths around the world it is estimated there were as few as a few dozen in the ancient world.  This scarcity was partly due to the fact that iron could only be smelted where there was land enough to grow crops to support the fires needed to reduce the iron ore into slag.

In regions without this luxury ancient societies turned to smelting other elements to provide the blacksmiths with their iron tools.  Copper was a particularly popular choice as it was readily available in rivers in many parts of the world.  The Romans were an early adopters of copper smelting and even experimented with applying it to their coinage but the Romans had plenty of copper so when their blacksmiths made copper tools they also started to use less of the copper and use other materials to give the finished product added value.  Lead was particularly popular as it was fairly inexpensive.  

It was not until the Industrial Revolution in the 14th and 15th centuries that blacksmiths had enough iron ore to support their craft.  This sudden increase"
" The imposing gateway is a work of art in its own right and it's clear that the museum has spent millions on its new modern design. On the street outside are the traditional old buildings, now dwarfed by the new construction. It's certainly a bold move to move into these historic surroundings and it seems to have paid off. The old buildings are empty now and the new, modern space has become the centre of Edinburgh. And the museum's new director seems to be doing something right. - She's certainly turned the museum around. There is a calm confidence about her that is a welcome change from her predecessor, who was out of step with the times and seemed more interested in maintaining the museum than pursuing it's new agenda. The museum's new collection is growing rapidly and the director seems to be well placed to continue that growth. The museum is certainly an exciting and progressive force to be at the heart of in Edinburgh. But it does seem to have missed its historic moment.

The museum opened in its new, modern building in 2017. It has a shiny new front, but it's the back of the building that is the star of the show, with a brand new, state of the art exhibition that celebrates the story of cheese. The old buildings have been replaced by modern, cheese-wedge style buildings, but at least they are in good company! They are surrounded by the old and the new, sitting in a new, prominent position, next to the city's major highway."," The building is beautiful and certainly makes an impressive statement to the people of Edinburgh. But as you walk past the glass cases of the exhibits, you start to notice the strange lack of exhibits. ""Why are there so few historical artifacts?"" Sally asks the friendly security guard. ""Oh, they're being replaced,"" he explains. ""The modern materials are just as authentic as the historical ones."" ""But there's no history!"" Sally declares. ""I've even noticed the glass cases are empty. This museum needs to include some artifacts to bring life to the building,"" the security guard says, then pauses. ""There's an exhibition coming up that's particularly unique. You should go check it out."" ""That sounds interesting, but I can't afford to go,"" Sally says regretfully. ""I'm not rich like you,"" the guard says. ""But I happen to know someone who would pay for my exhibit if I asked."" Sally thinks about this for a moment, and it finally occurs to her. ""Wait! I know just the person!"" she says, then runs out of the building. The museum's exhibition on the First World War is called ""Beyond the Battlefield"". Sally rushes inside, leaps over the reception desk, and enters the next room - filled with volunteers from all over the world. ""Hi, I'm Sally,"" she begins. ""And I'm so excited to be working on this exhibition! My exhibit is focused on the women of Scotland who served"," There's a giant cheese wedged in the road.  The cheese wedge building is a unique collection of interlocking modern cubes that rise from underneath a reconstructed nineteenth century Edinburgh skyline, replete with iconic clock tower. The design is audacious and controversial, with each cube designed to reflect a unique aspect of the architecture of old Edinburgh. But the boldest design of all - a giant cheese wedge - seems to be the museum's most poignant symbol, of the fragility of the human experience.

The modern cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened. She expected to find a new showcase for tartans, their weave and patterns. Instead, she found a museum that had been open for less than a month, filled with objects of historical value and beauty – but almost nothing of interest to the Tartan-lover. She was, she thought, very unwise to go there. 

The building is beautifully furnished and mounted with modern interactive technology, including video screens which enable visitors to take in the full history of Scottish dress. But if you are looking for actual examples of tartans, that is not so easy to find. The museum boasts a fine collection of rare and historic textiles, but they are all displayed in small, static museum cases, and there are no display cases for tartans in the vast space of the building. Sally was right to be wary: the museum did not have any of the objects that attracted her to visit in the first place. But she was unwise to go in without a proper grasp of the purpose of the museum, or even an understanding of the historical significance of the tartans in question.


Use examples from your own research to write a short answer explaining what the tartan museum is and"," It's as big as the other city buildings, and everything is on wheels or cart so that it can be toured around. Everything here was designed to be shown, not enjoyed. There were lots of flat-screen monitors playing digital media. But the real excitement was on the ground floor, where a small troupe of acrobats were performing. I hadn't realized that Scotland had such a rich history of circus arts. The performers were dressed in period costumes: tight-fitting leggings, tight-fitting bodysuits, high-button boots and helmets. The most amazing thing was that they were doing the same amazing tricks as the ancient Greeks and Romans. One troupe of acrobats performed only a few moves from Cirque de Soleil, while a second group wore long hair and did a combination of acrobats' movements and movements similar to the modern circus artists who do large trapezes and tight rope walks. Sally Varlow, a student at the University of Edinburgh, says that the museum's displays have modern additions but that the overall effect is that of a museum of the past: ""It's a visually stunning building but its contents feel a bitdated, if not a bit dowbt."" She thought that the museum's opening display of modern media from Scotland was a good start, but she was disappointed that the rest of the collection wasn't as well presented. She noted the absence of many pieces, including paintings, tapestries, a full"," The curving glass facades, designed by Renzo Piano and Paul Morill, are a stunning reflection of the Stirling sculpture of William Wynne. The museum itself is a well-appointed and well-curated space, with excellent access to both displays and public areas, and a well-chosen selection of artefacts and artworks. It is clearly intended to be a centre of local and national excellence. A good first-stop for a visit to Edinburgh. There are, however, some aspects of the museum's opening that didn't sit well with me. The staff were all efficient but quiet, and the queues for entry were long. There was little obvious activity while we were waiting, and the displays didn't make the most of the sunny day outside. Our guide, Andy, was clearly well-versed, but this came across as a bit dry, and we waited too long to visit some of the displays. The museum was lively as we left, the staff cheerfully circulating and taking advantage of the sunshine to venture outside. The museum's architecture and its displays make an important contribution to the city's profile. It is a good example of contemporary museum design. It is well appointed and it is welcoming. In addition, the displays, especially the ones on art and the history of art, are clearly very much in tune with what is being exhibited. It's a good museum.

" The comet's long-awaited return in 1986 had many, including Halley, looking to the skies. 

On the night of 17th October 1739, the astronomer and scientist retired to his house in London, Surrey to await the comet's next visit. He took up a position at the window looking at the sky, noting changes in the stars' positions with the seasons and the movement of the moon. It was at this time that he noticed a ""most beautiful star of the first magnitude"" that seemed to change position relative to the two other stars in the northern sky. Halley was convinced that it was the first glimpse of true north and believed he had discovered a new celestial phenomenon, which he published in 1718.


With the help of his friends and neighbours Toby Clark and William Bragg, Halley retraced the steps he had taken the previous year, examining the variation in the stars' positions on maps and observing the declination of Mars. On 28th October 1740 he described what he had observed as the ""first true observation of the variation of the magnetic needle"". Sir Francis Bacon praised his discovery and Halley was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1743. Sir Francis Bacon also paid Halley a visit and introduced him to a member of his own family.


Sir Francis Bacon was a key player in the scientific revolution of the late 17th and 18th century. He is also known to history for his"," In 1705, on a tour of duty as Comet King, he also started a quest that has led to a fundamental understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and the motion of the Earth around the Sun. Halley sought to measure variations in the magnetic North Pole. He hoped that the more accurately one knew the Earth's magnetic field, the better one could predict and avoid atmospheric shifts.

Today, the compass isn't exactly at the North Pole, but close to it. Instead, Halley's quest continues in the form of Dr Toby Clark who has spent the last three decades researching the Earth's magnetic field. His team have located an underground chamber that they believe holds the answer. They have recreated the conditions during a pre-Roman period - when the compass needle still pointed to the North Pole. The find will be announced next week.

But why focus on Sir Edmund Halley and not his successor - who bears his name. Anjana Ahuja asks Dr Clark: ""When he started his quest in 1705, no one knew what would happen to the compass needle. It was completely random. It pointed wherever it wanted to point. It was a complete mystery. When Sir Edmund Halley started his quest, many people thought he was mad. He was seen as the comet king obsessed with the Earth's magnetic field. And even today, people who knew him would never have thought he would be exploring underground chambers or inventing magnetic compasses. Sir Edmund"," Sir Edmund was born in Suffolk, England and studied at The University of Cambridge. 

He was appointed the Astromancer to the King of England in 1669. Sir Edmund travelled to Edinburgh and was knighted in 1671. Sir Edmund returned to Cambridge as a Goldsmith and proceeded to survey and map the earth. During the journey Sir Edmund made a scientific discovery which changed the course of astronomy and physics forever. 

During his journey to Edinburgh he had noted that the magnetic poles in Scotland and England were in alignment. Sir Edmund published his discovery in 1675 titled ""Magnetic Poles and True North"". Sir Edmund continued to conduct and oversee scientific expeditions to new places until his appointment as Astronomer to Charles II in 1685.

Sir Edmund died on 6th of January 1742.  His discovery of Magnetic Poles would go on to shape the science of Astronomy and Physics for generations to come.

Sir Edmund's quest for true north - retraced  by Dr Toby Clark - aims to show that Sir Edmund did not return empty handed. He set out with a team of scientists and surveyors to document and chart the earth. 

It was Sir Edmund's scientific observations made during his journeys that led to the understanding of the earth's magnetic field. Sir Edmund was one of the pioneers that charted the polarisation of the earth's magnetic field. Polarised land and sea - a new way to map the earth. 
"," Halley's comet is a periodic comet with a period of about 83 years. To date, this cometary object has returned in 1835, 1954, 2005, 2022 and 2058. The comet's perihelion has recently passed close to our planet's surface - in 2013 it was observed near the South Pole.

In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark a researcher at the British Geological Survey aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations.

Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Halley's comet is aperiodic comet with a period of about 83 years. To date, this cometary object has returned in 1835, 1954, 2005, 2022, and 2058. The comet's perihelion has recently passed close to our planet's surface - in 2013 it was observed near the South Pole.

Toby Clark, an astronomer at the British Geological Survey, aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to"," Over five years, Halley studied the Moon's orbit, then tracked comet after comet across the solar system, culminating in an historic visit to the planet Mars in 1733. However, Halley also charted variations in the direction that compass needles pointed, a finding that he believed was evidence of a ""magnetic world"" beneath the surface of the Earth.

The British Geological Survey had lost Halley's data, but had retained enough documents to make a start on the process of charting compass variations. The idea was to compare the recorded variations with actual variations measured by instruments aboard the HMS Challenger. Challenger was launched in 1847, and the mission to measure compass variations was planned as a routine science mission. As part of the science programme, Professor James Halswelle, Director of the BGS, asked Dr Toby Clark to head the research team.

Clark, a highly-regarded geologist, was already familiar with Halley's findings. He was also aware that his superiors at the BGS were not happy with him. Clark faced intense scrutiny from the scientific establishment, and was accused of being a ""dangerous radical"" for publishing works questioning the Earth's stability.

As he started to map out the journey to Mars, however, Clark's concerns began to disappear. On the voyage he developed an infection, and he suffered another, fatal, attack of cholera on his return to the UK.

"," It was in 1758 that Halley made the remarkable claim that the stars seemed to sweep around the horizon when the ship on which he was sailing was buffeted by a storm. The discovery that the Earth's axial tilt was rotating led him to further suggest that the Earth was the centre of the solar system and this was supported by the variability of the compass. Halley's Comet will return in 2016 and this story will be featured in our 2016 calendar. Dr Toby Clark is the principal researcher at the British Geological Survey and he will be part of the team to mark the comet's return. He recalls when he first met Sir Edmund Halley and recalls his commitment to research as a child; this is an example of the passion that drove him. In 1718 Clark began his PhD research in the field of Magnetic Science at Cambridge University. The work on which he focused was based on the variation in the direction of a compass needle induced by the Earth's magnetic field. 

The documentary then follows Toby Clark and his colleagues as they prepare for the return of Halley's Comet and Anjana Ahuja reports from the Calcutta Literature Festival where Halley's Comet was recently showcased. Toby Clark and the team are keen to attract new sponsors and they are appealing to Calcutta's intelligentsia and science community to financially support their work.

In 1706 Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, founded an expedition to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Based on his research Sir Toby created a magnetometer which measures magnetic intensity. Sir Toby will use this device to track the magnetic field and look for signs of the earth's magnetic poles. To find the true north, Sir Toby will look for landmarks with a north-pointing name, such as church spires, cemeteries, windmills and power stations. 
  
Sir Toby and his team, consisting of 60 people, will set off to visit the most promising locations across England. They will also visit a monastery in Switzerland where Sir Edmund Halley once stayed, to gain access to a map containing information on the locations of the magnetic mountains. 
  
As an experienced expeditioner, Sir Toby knows what to expect. He will use a compass and, if necessary, a magnetic needle to navigate and avoid obstacles. He will carefully measure the angle of declination on the way and will pay attention to the weather. To date, Sir Toby has become very familiar with the terrain. On his previous expedition in 17"

But more important than the room is the warmth, the welcome and the food. For years the hotel has been synonymous with ‘Goli Marwa’ - biryani, a dish originating in the north of India, in the small town of Amritsar, to which Sajjan has close family connections. On the day of our visit, the house menu had one standout offering - ‘Murg biryani’, a stunning dish of multi-coloured rice and chicken, with the option of adding goat or lamb, both local delicacies.

Climbing the other peaks will require specialized climbing clothing and equipment. Climbing each peak will take a different number of attempts, and of course, different amounts of time. I will make every attempt on each of these peaks. I will not abandon a climb until I am on the summit of each of these peaks. In all, I will attempt every peak fourteen times, beginning with peaks C and D. But, I will not attempt to climb any of these peaks a second time because in each case, I made a mistake and failed.

When I set out to climb the Seven Summits, there was one peak I wanted to aim for, the highest mountain on each of the continents, the peak of which would be the final peak. From my list, Mount Everest was the highest peak for those on the list. In the years following my quest, I went to the summit of Mt. Everest seven times. One after another, I climbed the other six peaks. 

With each summit came a mix of emotion and surprise at what I had done. Some peaks I was eager to climb as soon as I heard about them. Other peaks, like Mt. McKinley, seemed like the furthest left off for me to climb. But I kept going, pushing myself to the limit each time. On each summit, I experienced the exhilaration of reaching my goal and the sheer beauty of the mountains I had seen in photos.

My Seven Summits Climbing Quest

First Summit, Mt. Everest. On this summit, the questing mountaineer stands on the summit of the highest mountain on earth, the mountain that man has been trying to conquer since the dawn of time. From this vantage point, and with the guidance of a Sherpa in traditional blue and white hat, the mountaineer takes in the breathtaking views of the Earth from atop the tallest mountain on each of the other six continents. The high point of the Earth is at the south pole and the tallest mountain on each of the other six continents, including the tallest, is less than half that height, as the crow flies. In addition, each of the other five tallest mountains is only a couple hundred feet taller than Mount Everest.  From this vantage point, one can see the curvature of the Earth and the curvature of the sun as it rises. It’s a view not shared by anyone living a quarter of a mile to either side of the summit. Standing on the summit of Mount Everest, one has attained the highest point on each of the six continents, and as such the tallest man on Earth. 

Second Summit, Mt. Kiliman"
" You must not expect your subject to sit and look straight into the lens all the time. You need to make allowances for their movements and actions that make the photograph unique. Even a child has complex gestures, gestures that cannot be mimicked by the photographer. As a photographer you must be prepared to observe, observe, observe. To let go of the shot you want to get, to be ready to click the moment when the person in the picture turns their head or starts looking around, to be ready to click the moment when the subject blinks to show that they are actually looking into your camera and not into the sun, to be ready to click the moment when the subject looks into the sun or to the left or right and it is distracting you from the main subject. You must be ready to click the moment when the subject smiles because they recognize the photographer or when they realize that it is just the two of you in the picture. You should not be surprised if you don't click any photo. You can be prepared to go out again tomorrow and try again. Photographing Children Children can be even more challenging. The photographer has to be extremely gentle. Don't expect your child to sit still or look into the lens without any movements. The main thing is to get the photograph and let the parent frame the moment themselves. It is much more important to let the child frame the moment than to guide the parent in what the child has to do. In life we can only take a"," If the photographer misses an expression or a movement the picture has no human interest. If the photographer tries to click every feature and misses something special the image is unlikely to be memorable. There are hundreds of photographers on this earth. You could spend all your life collecting cameras lenses and flashes trying to figure out what works and what doesn't. Some photographers are lucky and some photographers are not so lucky. If you are going to take pictures of people its better to work with a photographer who specializes in people photography and has a lot of experience. You might then get more out of the experience. This photographer has a nice mix of people in a variety of settings. Her pictures have good composition and exposure. The colors are vibrant. The people seem comfortable and happy. The only thing I noticed was that she was not that creative with her compositions. She was more interested in finding the right background and foreground and angles than really striking a memorable pose. This may be a challenge to you who has a bigger creative brain and tries to come up with better compositions. On the other hand it may not be that difficult to work with a specialist in people photography and get some great pictures. The combination of these two things makes for a good photography experience. I would encourage you to ask for this photographer and see if she can get you good pictures of people.


In this example we see that both the photographer and the subject matter of the photographs were people. A key takeaway from this prompt is that the photographer ("," A photographer should try and capture the essential part of the person being photographed. A good photographer should be able to tell a person from a car or a building. In order to do this the photographer has to understand what the person is feeling at that particular moment. The photographer has to be able to tell if the person is laughing, crying or just thinking about something. A good photographer is constantly in 'look', 'feel', 'hearing' and 'tasting' mode. They should be looking for detail, textures and the subtleties of light and shadow. To make matters more difficult we have now all become more self-conscious and look for'styled' photographs with flattering angles. A good photographer is able to work out what the subject is thinking and the mood they are in so they can capture it all with the right composition. Photographs tell a story and a good photograph is able to tell a story. This is what makes them so powerful.  The photograph below shows a group of young people at an unauthorised demonstration in Oxford. The photographer has taken away the power of the image with her/his technical ability. The photograph does not show the beauty of the subject matter and the power of the image lies in the story it tells. It captures a moment in history when people were trying to make their mark on the world and change the world through democratic means. The photograph shows that although it is unauthorised this does not take away from the beauty of the people"," These can be altered in a photograph, in ways that can spoil the effect. 

The story should tell of a talented photographer who has to be extra careful and considerate of the people in her/his photos as they can often be altered in ways that spoil the photo. The photographer should also get trained professionals to assist in ensuring the best possible photos are taken.


Photo: A photographer is in a unique position to witness first hand the world around her and document it with clarity and grace. She can capture moments with fleeting beauty that a simple photo would fail to capture. She takes pride in her work and takes on projects where technical and creative challenges are pitted against one another. While the camera may be an intrusive presence in picturesque scenes, it becomes a welcomed ally when it comes to portraits and group photos where the viewer is given an opportunity to study and absorb the subject's unique expressions.


Despite the challenges of the profession, the photographer's instinctive aptitude for light and her mastery of composition are her key assets that help her make the best of her craft. The photographer takes pride in her work and enjoys the challenge of overcoming hurdles that often get in the way of capturing compelling images of the world around her.


The photographer may hire professionals to take her photographs when she has to work in adverse conditions or undertake projects where fastidious photography is a requisite. In spite of this, it is the photographer's innate aptitude for composition and light that"," The subject could be in motion and the photographer needs to be prepared to brake or back-off to make the shot. It is a lot harder to take a bad picture of a person than a landscape or scene. And yet I am not particularly a fan of posed pictures. I like to think that I capture more interesting pictures of people doing the things they love most – with a smile and in their own natural environment. I have to say that the last few years have not been particularly comfortable for me as a photographer. I feel there are a lot of lazy amateurs out there taking loads of pictures of ordinary things, without thinking much about composition, lighting and story. This is why I try to do things differently. I love to go to concerts and sports events where I can get a sense of the space and use it to help tell the story. Sometimes I use artificial lighting to make the subject stand out. I get a little help from the engineer to frame the photo. Often times I will use a longer lens to ensure there is some depth of field. And I use multiple exposures to blur the background so the main subject stands out. When I photograph people they are often a little apprehensive and so I try to put myself in their shoes, asking them to stand with me so I can get a sense of the space and background. I then tell them what I am doing, ask them if they like the concept of the photograph and then we get down to business. When I am photograph"," These are always the most interesting part of a photograph. 
People also have the tendency to change places, facial features and expression very fast. 
These make people a difficult subject to photograph well. Even the shutter speed, aperture, ISO settings, lens and even the composition have to be done very quickley as things change so fast. 
All these make people a very interesting subject to photograph, however the ability to capture someone's essence, the personality of the person and emotion in the photograph is not guaranteed. It is however a great subject for the artist who is able to capture the essence of the person in the image. 
An iconic portrait may go viral on social media like a meme but the artistry, skill and talent of the photographer behind the lens has been lost and the subject may no longer be recognizable. 
An excellent portrait of a wellknown person may fetch several thousand dollars, but how much artistry, skill and talent went into the image, and the person in the image may be lost.
A photograph of someone is unique. However, in 30 years some information may be lost about the subject of the photograph. That is what makes the subject of photography so interesting and difficult.

He takes one look around the hallway and the Globe and his face lights up with pride. ""The Globe, that's wonderful! How much?"" Christopher Middleton says.

I feel as though I am trespassing but I suppose that’s to be expected.’ Christopher Middleton: ‘You don’t have a reservation do you?’ Christopher Middleton: ‘No, my driver told the desk clerk I would be joining him at the Globe.’ Christopher Middleton: ‘Ah, well I’ll let them know you’re here.’ Christopher Middleton: ‘That would be wonderful.

Sue Brown told Christopher Middleton that she would be proud to have him as a judge at her hotel inspection. """," The manager, on his day off, has turned the hotel’s bar into a makeshift surgery. Two staff members are performing CPR on a member of the public, while another staff member stares vacantly into space. “And just look at this state of disarray! The carpets and vinyls need to be cleaned and refreshed ASAP. The kitchen needs a good tidy up. And I can’t believe the toilet seats are still not covered with wax!”, Sue Brown explains. Christopher Middleton wonders what would happen if he showed up in town now. He has heard that the Globe Hotel is in a dismal state and is unimpressed. It would not be the first time he was disappointed with a hotel. But this hotel, though. He just had to see it for himself. He’ll keep a look out for the rooms, but he’s pretty sure he could find the hotel for free. “I could probably even put a tracer on you and your room would show up on my map. If you know what I mean”, he says to Christopher Middleton, who is about to check in for his honeymoon. “Yes, it will definitely be very convenient”, Christopher Middleton replies, excitedly heading to the registration desk. While he is waiting for the clerk, Christopher Middleton sees a couple of the hotel’s other guests wandering around, clearly confused. “My gosh. They all look lost”, Christopher Middleton says to himself"," The bell boy, whose uniform is stained with alcohol, is struggling to hold on to the tray of dirty glasses on his head. The barman, who has just handed out a free round of shots with a guest’s birthday money, is struggling to keep the flow of drinks moving. And as the Inspectors make their way from room to room, each one is giving a cursory once-over to make sure nothing is out of place before leaving again. Their judgement is based purely on what they see and in a place like this it’s all anyone can do. It’s a shambolic display that only serves to make the guests at the Globe Hotel uneasy. Sure, they have paid a premium for a room that is a little bit worse for wear, but there’s just something about this year’s inspection that feels off. As Christopher Middleton sneaks a peak around the corner of the Globe Hotel from his hiding place, he notices the Hotel Inspector has already turned her back on the receptionist and is staring blankly at the far wall. The sound of the bell boy retching could be heard from three storeys down. Christopher knows this hotel like the back of his hand and, after a bit of discreet hanky-pying, he makes his move. With the Inspectors distracted, he sneaks into the room where the guest is partying. This is where the plan goes wrong.

Chris doesn’t realise it yet"," At the desk the bellhop is slumped over with his lunch in his hand and the mail clerk is busy reading a magazine and oblivious to all around.  

From the moment Christopher Middleton checked in he has seen only trouble. He tries the room door repeatedly, each time finding it locked. He wanders the hallways aimlessly looking for a nearby phone to call reception, where he is greeted with the same frustrating answer that they are ""out of phones."" He can hear muffled voices on the phone from one of the rooms, but they refuse to answer their phone. He has been given a keycard for the hotel room but is still unable to enter the room, even when the card is scanned. He has also noticed some strange goings-on in the hotel lobby. Everyone is rushing from room to room, but he can't figure out where all the action is. He spots Mr. and Mrs. Stone, an elderly couple from across the lobby, who are struggling to get into their room due to an ""inadvertent mistake."" Their room number is 2121.

" It’s worth noting that in some countries you don’t need a sample to be considered for the job but almost certainly your CV would be reviewed against your sample. Research in the last decade has shown us that we can distinguish between people who have neuro-typical handwriting and those with dys- handwriting using computer vision. These researchers also discovered that there are subtle differences in the way people who write with different handwritng styles hold their pen. We even have a name for the latter phenomenon – heteromenia. It’s interesting to speculate whether we might be able to use handwriting to predict who might be a good parent, a good worker, a good colleague, or any other role where teamwork is required.

The study mentioned would almost certainly have been conducted in the last 10 years though. The paper in question is “Deep convolutional neural networks for handwritten word recognition” by Piotr Obzus et al., published in 2013. The researchers include a number of authors currently active in the field of deep learning and computer vision and this is no doubt a work which will generate further follow-up work in the future. The authors themselves are from the University of Warsaw and the paper was co-authored by Wojciech Zaremba.


Interestingly, the study was inspired by similar work done by Professor Tadashi Saeki of the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, Japan, who has been studying heteromenia in relation"," Some countries require a minimal sample size of 50 characters. In some countries the minimum sample size is 50 characters. In most countries however a sample size of 50 characters would be considered too little to make a judgement about someone’s suitability. Some may interpret this as a sign that handwriting itself does not contain sufficient information. And whilst it is a fact that handwriting does not contain sufficient information to make a reliable job decision, this is not true. There is a scientific basis for the study of handwriting. In particular, when the same author writes exactly the same characters in exactly the same way for a long enough period of time, some kind of pattern or structure will emerge in the form of a graph called a palmistry chart. Handwriting palmistry charts are more accurate than psychiatric reports for making job choices. A psychiatric report may contain relevant information, but only so much as is recorded by the psychiatrist. Palmistry charts are able to predict a person’s success in life even before the person enters the job market. Handwriting palmistry charts are based on the concept of karma. Karma is the invisible and direct connection between every deed a person does in this lifetime and its results in this and the subsequent lifetimes. It would seem the invisible hand of Karma is more powerful than the analyst who only operates from afar. The palmist can determine if someone will be happy in their work by looking at their palm. You might want to think twice before sending this palmist your next memo."," It’s very likely that not everyone who holds a similar job will have had their handwriting assessed, but the employer would want to be sure they are getting the most capable person for the job.  The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst  is a quote from the philosopher Edmund Husserl. He is well known for his phenomenology, the way in which the structures of human consciousness are revealed through the study of perceptual experience.   The quote describes how the modern science of psychology had begun to replace the old, Aristotelian notion that the seat of consciousness is located within the body, with a notion that consciousness is external to the body. 
The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support  is the perspective of a handwriting consultant, who assess whether or not what they are reading is genuine, and whether it is a forgery. Her job is to check that all the letters in a text are of the same height and thickness, and are all laid down with the same amount of pressure. The assessment is a form of biometrics, the analysis of the physical appearance of a person, and its purpose is to find telltale signs that someone may have written a text with a computer. With the growing use of electronic means of writing, more and more employers are demanding that the quality of the text is equal to that of a printed document. But whereas in the past employers would have had their own handwriting assessment experts, today they prefer to use"," Would it reflect too much on you to sign a blank contract or on paper that looks like someone has been messing about with it using a Sharpie? This short story will investigate the question of handwriting and the power it has over us. In particular the power it has over the psychoanalysts who try to read into our deepest, darkest thoughts.


‘The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst’

by Mark Haddon


The handwritten word has always carried its own authority. Its distinctiveness and uniqueness have always set it apart from the typed word. Even back in the days of mechanical typewriters, the occasional handwritten word could still be read with some ease. However, over time, the handwritten word has lost much of its authority. There is a subtle erosion of its distinctiveness, caused by the growing prevalence of computerized devices.


Today, it is almost impossible to read a typed word without the aid of a computer. And this, despite the fact that many of us now routinely type out entire documents by hand. Indeed, the ease with which typed words can now be read is causing many to question their authenticity. The handwriting, once viewed with suspicion, is now simply a part of the background, to be read and discarded as if it were any other piece of paper.


The authority of handwriting has similarly eroded over time. A century ago, the authority of handwriting was largely unimpaired. But nowadays, an examination"," In particular the type of strokes used to form letters, their consistency and the overall appearance of the script would be closely watched. Even today’s sophisticated methods of scanning letters and comparing them with a reference database do not beat the personal impressions acquired through reading handwriting. So be careful what you write next time - the pen may be mightier but it is the psychoanalyst that may decide your fate.


Use this as a starting point to express your opinion on handwriting in the workplace


The pen may be mightier but it is the psychoanalyst that may decide your fate.


The pen mightier than the psychoanalyst –


The handwriting as much as anything else would determine a person's suitability for a job. In particular the type of strokes used to form letters, their consistency and the overall appearance of the script would be closely watched. Even today's sophisticated methods of scanning letters and comparing them with a reference database do not beat the personal impressions acquired through reading handwriting.


So be careful what you write next time - the pen may be mightier but it is the psychoanalyst that might decide your fate.


If you apply for a job in some countries you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting as much as anything else that would determine your suitability for the job. In particular the type of strokes used to form letters, their consistency and the overall appearance of the script would be closely watched.

"," In some countries people even undergo handwriting analysis before they are offered a job. Why is that? Many think that handwriting is a reflection of one’s character and that a person’s signature can reveal a lot about them. This view has been expressed by eminent psychoanalysts like Sigmund Freud who, as a child, discovered he had the handwriting of a criminal. He went on to say that handwriting is “mightier than the pen”. As an eminent psychoanalyst he would have been in a good position to comment on the handwriting of criminals but his views on handwriting cannot be assumed to be widely held. While it is still a view that is not widely held, there is some scientific support for the view that handwriting reveals a persons character. Analysis of the characteristics of the letters of a person’s signature are able to be able to classify that person into a number of categories such as criminals. 

What is your opinion of this view? Do you think handwriting analysis is a valid way of judging a person’s character or is it based on more limited views of handwriting? 

The number of words and syllables per sentence is lower in the book. The number of sentences per page is about half the number of words, and the number of syllables in each sentence is half the number of words. This results in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale giving a grade of 7.9.

The number of words and syllables per sentence is"," This is why many employers still ask for a sample of handwriting when appointing a new employee. 

The story should give an idea of the benefits of handwriting analysis.

" This is because much of what needs to be done in developing countries is either not done at all or is done very inefficiently. However, international voluntary organizations do a very important job that is not accomplished through governmental means. The organizations send volunteers to countries that have few resources and little aid to offer. These volunteers provide much-needed healthcare services, teach basic literacy and numeracy skills, build schools, and conduct research to make sure that their nations receive the assistance that they need. The development impact of international voluntary work is enormous, as it allows aid to reach those in need without requiring significant financial resources. International voluntary organizations also help to keep developing nations accountable for their actions, because they are held accountable for the needs they cannot or do not want to fulfill on their own. Thus, while one may criticize the effectiveness of the organizations for their lack of direct contribution to development, it must be noted that without them, there would be no development. B. The vast majority of aid organizations provide volunteer-based aid, and they often refer to themselves as ‘volunteer tourism’. This volunteer-based tourism is a major contribution to development in underdeveloped countries. The volunteers teach basic literacy and numeracy skills, provide healthcare services, build schools, and conduct research for the organizations in return for an allowance that is comparable to minimum wage in the countries they visit. This contribution is invaluable, as it allows aid organizations to fulfill their core objective of helping those in need without requiring significant financial resources. Thus,","  B.

Volunteer tourism is not as difficult as people might think, it can be a great way to help others and increase awareness of development. F. Volunteer tourism can be a fun activity that can be done while helping people develop skills that will help them improve their lives and the lives of others. G. Volunteer tourism is not difficult, but it is important to make sure that one does not become disheartened by the number of volunteers needed compared to the number of development projects. H. International voluntary work is important and is generally beneficial to both the volunteer and the person being helped. I. It is important to remember that not all volunteers directly contribute to development, they provide an experience to those who participate. J.

Many people participate in voluntary work to provide an effective way to make a contribution to global health and development.  

A, B, C, and E are incorrect. D is the correct answer. Voluntary work is able to provide a significant contribution to global health and development.  However, it is unlikely that it provides a proportional amount of GDP as development. 

Voluntary work can provide a means to make a significant contribution to global health and development. In 2008, voluntary work contributed over 2% of the world GDP, and is likely to increase in the coming years as a result of a worldwide economic downturn.

In most cases, they receive very little money for their work, although it is often given directly to the organizations where the volunteers work. B. Voluntary work has a large impact on society and the world around us. It improves the conditions of many people around the world and has a positive influence on the environment. Not only that, it reduces inequality between countries and increases the equality between them. C. Voluntary work is often done by young people who may feel isolated while studying at college or university, and often find that it is easier to join an organization that already has members. It gives them a sense of belonging and purpose and often they are able to make a bigger difference to the world than they could if they worked a traditional nine to five. D.

" You'll see a huge variety of subjects including portraits, gods and goddesses, scenes from Greek mythology, and many everyday objects from daily life such as urns and vases. The collection is spread over several floors with casts of works on display in the galleries of the museum as well as stored in cases in the basement. Your journey starts on the ground floor where you can view the original sculptures in the atrium. Many visitors arrive here by steam engine, but this is not the purpose of the museum. You're here to study the casts and to look at the collections of Greek and Roman sculptures on display. If you're new to the subject of Greek and Roman sculpture there is a good video on YouTube by the British Museum entitled 'What you should know about Greek and Roman sculpture'. You may like to watch it now if you haven't. If you would like to watch a film on YouTube you can use the button below. B. Casts of Greek and Roman sculpture on display in the University Museum of Classical Archaeology This collection of Greek and Roman sculptures is impressive and is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world. The museum has a wide range of casts of subjects including portraits, gods and goddesses, scenes from Greek mythology and everyday objects from daily life including urns and vases. The collection is divided up into several floors with the most recent sculptures on display in the ground floor galleries, while the older ones are stored in cases in the"," The originals are in the form of terracottas which were created by covering a clay surface with a thin layer of stone. The Terracotta Army was discovered in 1965 in a field in the tomb of King Xerxes of Syro-Macedonia in Dahuk, Iraq. It is thought that around 47,000 to 60,000 terracotta figures were originally attached to the tomb walls. It is believed that the figures were taken out of the tomb around 310 BC and were initially stored in a warehouse in nearby Gaziantep in a state of semi-deflation. A team of German archaeologists led by Philipp Reis, while attempting to drain the warehouse, stumbled across the Terracotta Army and were so astonished at the find that they left the statues partially in their deflated state. After the discovery of the Terracotta Army archaeologists became concerned that the figures would become damaged if left in their current state of semi-deflation.

The team of German archaeologists led by Philipp Reis removed the figures from the tomb and took them to Gaziantep. The archaeologists were faced with the difficult and time-consuming task of taking each figure out of its terracotta casting and transporting it to a warehouse for redeployment. It is estimated that between 310 BC and 221 BC, the number of terracotta statues recovered by the archaeologists was between 42,000 and 52,000. Philipp Reis and his colleagues"," Many of the pieces are copies made from stone carvings of the originals.  Others have been copied from photographs and models.
The collection was founded by George Wynne, who became frustrated that so little classical sculpture remained in Britain that it was not being seen by the general public. He spent his life savings on collecting sculpture to build up a display. Today, the collection is open to the public and free to enter, but has no restrictions on the use of any pieces.


B. Cast of a head of Athena from a Roman marble original in the collection of the University Museum of Classical Archaeology. The piece is a faithful copy of a real piece and is an excellent example of how cast copies can be made.


C. The Athena of the Roman marble original in the collection of the University Museum of Classical Archaeology. This piece is an excellent example of how original and non-original objects came together in antiquity to create this unique collection.


D. The piece of marble from which Athena was cast was taken from a Temple of Athena Parthenos on the Acropolis of Athens and is a unique survivor of one of the world's most famous archaeological sites.


E. Many of the pieces in the collection were taken from temples on the Acropolis of Athens. This makes the collection particularly significant since the Acropolis is an UNESCO world heritage site and there was a temple of Athena Parthenos on this site at"," The collection has a history. It started with an excavation in the valley of the Neronious below Rome. Its director was Flavio Biondo and he found some remarkable pieces of Greek and Roman sculpture from this site. To Biondo fell the task of transporting these amazing pieces of sculpture back to Rome where they would be safe from plunderers. He created a team of young assistants and they travelled to the excavation site on horseback. They set up camp and used the local artisans to cast the pieces of sculpture. Over time the collection grew and Flavio Biondo was able to build his own laboratory to further develop the techniques of reconstruction and casting. Now the Museum of Classical Archaeology has become one of the most famous museums in the world. It is visited by over a million people each year and attracts enthusiastic amateurs and professionals alike. The museum is often open to the public so that people can see these amazing pieces of classical sculpture first hand and learn more about the ancient world. It is considered a national treasure. The Greek gods are represented here, including Perseus who is grabbing the head of Medusa in order to save himself from her gaze. Medusa is a Gorgon, one of the monster-like monsters that is a product of Greek art and mythology. Perseus was a hero of Greek mythology, a young general of the Persian army who had defeated the greek god, Achaemenid, and captured him in"," Of the original six hundred pieces, about one hundred and fifty are bronzes and the rest are stone. The collection has been split into twenty subcollections relating to themes including Greek life, Roman gladiators, Egyptian funerary ritual and many others. Some of the bronzes are over two hundred years old. 

The collection is on the ground floor of the Archaeological Museum in Oxford. You will need to go through a security barrier to access the museum. You will have to show photo ID to access the museum. You will have the sculptures to examine for free, but you must take a photo of your ID which will be checked against a catalogue of objects in the museum. Once inside, make your way to the far end of the ground floor. There is a staircase at this end of the floor which takes you to the first floor where there is more space to look at the collection and to stand at some of the original sites where the sculptures were found. The top floor of the museum is not open to the public and contains many other objects from the Ancient World. The collection on this floor includes coins, mosaics, pottery and jewellery from all parts of the ancient world including Greek and Roman artefacts. There are also interactive parts of the museum with rooms that show how objects were used and how they were made. The museum is closed from Monday to Saturday but opens at the earliest from 6.30 am to 8 pm on Sundays so that you can see"," The originals may have been melted down during the persecution of Jews during the second world war and it was felt that nothing of historic significance could be lost by preserving them in bronze. 

This sculpture represents the celebrated Athena Parthenos, the Athenian goddess of wisdom and war. It was created in Constantinople in about 450 AD and is one of the largest and most expressive freestanding female sculptures ever created by the Greeks.

The museum was established in 1881, and the Athena Parthenos was probably loaned to the museum in 1911, as it is represented in this photograph. Today the Museum of Classical Archaeology is not in Athens but in London where the University of London has its headquarters, on the Strand.

The second thing to remember is that the display of the collection has been restricted to two main galleries - the ancient Greek Sculpture Gallery and the Roman Sculpture Gallery. The third thing to remember is that you will be visiting the museum while it's closed - it's open to the public but only one group of visitors at a time is allowed on the premises at any one time - this is to prevent accidental damage to the wonderful collections which are housed in the museum. So sit down, pour yourself a cup of tea and read on as I tell you what to expect on your visit to the University Museum of Classical Archaeology. The first gallery you enter on your visit is the ancient Greek Sculpture Gallery. There is a small information panel here which tells you about this gallery and that it's closed due to restoration work. This part of the museum is actually quite fascinating and I'd encourage you to pay it a visit. The sculptures on display are mostly of ancient Greek Gods and Heroes. Some of the highlights in this gallery are:- Lysippos' Zeus, Lysias' Hermes and Praxiteles' Aphrodite. As you move around this gallery, take particular note of the proportion of the sculptures.

" 'That's so kind of you to notice,' I added, as I helped myself to the wine list and spent 10 minutes deliberating whether it was too expensive for my budget. 'I'll have one of those,' I said to the man seated in the booth across the table. As soon as I sat down he reached into his wallet and handed me the cheque. 'That's so kind of you to spend my money on me' I exclaimed, genuinely taken aback. 'Oh no,' he quickly interjected, 'it's the least I could do after you saved my pants last night.' 'Oh, that's so sweet of you to say' I replied, feeling like a different person. My manager later complimented me on my excellent table service and the attentive manner in which I dealt with my customers, though I wasn't sure if he was being kind or just doing his job! I suppose the moral of this cautionary tale is that you should be more like the restaurant manager than you think! 

Based on the prompt, a story about being too nice for your own good would be:

	""When I was a waitress in a restaurant I was so nice that I was about to lose my job. The manager had to step in and do what was best for the business. When I dropped the plate on the floor and it exploded, the manager was so kind that he let me keep my job.""

	""When I had my first job"," 'Oh! I'm so sorry' I repeated, now standing in front of a very angry customer who threatened to have me arrested if I wasn't more careful in the future. 'I'm really sorry' I offered when I dropped a tray of glasses on the floor and they all shattered, and again when I wasn't fast enough to notice when my boss was out of the room. And the problem was, I couldn't help it. I was too nice for my own good. People got on my back all the time. I wasn't allowed to be bossy. I was too nice and they bossed me around. I was determined to stop being so nice. And what happened? Being nice did stop me getting into too much trouble but now I was getting into even more. 'You're too nice' I complained to my mom. 'You really have to be a bit more grumpy to get things done' she suggested. 'Like my granny' I replied. 'Your granny was grouchy but she got things done' she reminded me, and so did I. I'm not sure if being nice works. I'm going to have to try a bit harder.

  * One way to make it harder for the learner to be too nice is to replace 'I'm too nice for my own good' with a pun, e.g., 'Are you too quick for your pants?', 'Are you too quick for your pants?',"," 'It's my bad', I laughed, and you know what they say about assuming - it probably is. But what I failed to realize is that I was probably too nice for my own good because I didn't learn that in this line of work you can get away with anything if you smile and look pleasant. It's only later in life, having kids and getting married, that you learn the true meaning of patience and humility. I wish I had learned this lesson the hard way in my previous job, because I would probably not have gotten into so much trouble on my first day as a waitress. 
The moral of this story is that being too nice for your own good can backfire later in life and cause you to get into more trouble than you already have.

Note: This can be a tongue twister. 

Use this to write a short story: 
My first job as a waitress was not a good one. It was a thankless job where I learned the hard way to be patient and humble. As a result, I did not get into as much trouble as I otherwise would have.

  * It was a thankless job 
  * I learned the hard way to be patient and humble

  * I did not get into as much trouble as I otherwise would have

  * I wish I had learned this lesson the hard way in my previous job, because I would not have gotten into so much trouble on my first day"," The customers hated me then but now they love me! I even started taking the attitude when I didn't get my way. After all, wasn't I too nice for my own good?

  * Grade 60 to 75: Indicates text that is easy to understand.
  * Grade 85 to 100: Indicates text that is very difficult to understand.

  * In the text ""Are you too nice for your own good? When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant"," Smiles indeed. The manager noticed and I ended up being demoted to an assistant waiter. It wasn't a disaster, the manager needed an assistant and I lacked ambition so it was fine. 
  However, things soon went wrong again when my supervisor, an Italian, became very jealous when he noticed that I was giving the customers' orders to the waitress. I remember a particularly embarrassing occasion when a man walked up to the counter and shouted at me to'make me a drink, I'm waiting' and then when I said I didn't know how to make a drink 'I'll teach you'. I had to take the man to the toilet to vomit, after which he came back and yelled at me some more. My smile had been quite effective when I was demoted but it didn't work when my Italian supervisor was jealous of me. 
  It was at this point that I realised I should never, ever, be too nice to people. I now have an assistant who always seems to be smiling at him, which is fine. We're both now at the assistant level, and I don't need to be demoted again. I think it's a good lesson to learn.

Solution:

In this passage, the main character learns a valuable life lesson. She learns that being nice can lead you astray and that being ""too nice"" can actually hurt your reputation in the workplace. The author also suggests that the character's demotion was not"," My boss was sympathetic. 'That must have hurt your feelings.' I replied: 'Oh no, please don't worry. I'll do my best to avoid such accidents in the future.' I was sure that he would allow me to remain employed if only I promised to be more diligent at avoiding messes. 'That's enough Mr. Kowalski. You are dismissed.' I jumped with joy at the chance to remain in my job, despite the fact that the manager also had a son much younger than me. He often teased me about my ineffectiveness as a waitress. 'Don't worry dear. I have faith that one day your day will come', he would say whenever his eyes glanced in my direction. My patience was not infinite. One morning while clearing dishes I found a big, dirty spoon in the sink. 'What's that?', he asked. I replied: 'I don't know. I didn't touch it'. My boss sighed and turned to go to work. A few minutes later he returned, visibly irritated. 'What's that dirty thing in the sink?', he demanded. I froze, not knowing what to say. 'I think it's a spoon dear. Someone must have dropped it here a moment ago and I was cleaning it up', he continued. 'Well, it better be washed', I hissed through my teeth. He sighed again and walked away.  
That evening as I was about to put the dishes"," The customers were surprised and impressed and the boss even praised me for being so helpful. I kept my friendly demeanor throughout the rest of my shifts, especially after a few of my friends at work got married and started having babies. My customers were happy to see me and they started visiting more often, they loved my babies and even started commenting on how cute I was looking. My friends were jealous and started wishing they had a baby so they could be the perfect example of good behavior to emulate. My attitude and behavior went from good to excellent and I was soon offered more and more difficult and less pleasant jobs. I remember a customer asking me to shave off a particularly thick and bushy eyebrow hair. 'It's not my job to do that' I told him, 'but thank you for asking'. 'I insist' he replied. I gritted my teeth and obediently shaved the hair off. I still remember feeling sick to my stomach and wishing I could retract the statement that I had promised him. It was then I realized that I had lost my sense of personal decency and had started treating my work like a playground where I could show off my best qualities such as my friendly personality and willingness to do unpleasant work without complaint. My boss warned me that I had become too friendly and I had better stop treating my work like a joke. When I asked him what he meant he just shook his head and did not speak to me for several days. The following week"
" However, as he spoke to the passengers he realised something wasn’t right and the plane had an unnerving wobble. “I know it seems strange but trust me you feel really heavy out here”. The students exchanged nervous glances. “That’s because you’re not weightless” replied the pilot. “There is an invisible force field around this aircraft that protects it from outside air and anything that doesn’t go through it” He then turned off the air conditioning, opened up the windows, cranked up the stereo and even played loud music. The students slowly started to feel more weightless, and soon dropped to the floor. “There’s nothing to worry about” added the pilot. “The force field is only to protect against people, tools and things that enter this aircraft from outside.” 
  	“But we’re weightless” replied one of the students. 
  	“Yes but the invisible force field is what stops us from falling” explained Mumford. 
  	“What does that have to do with gravity?” questioned one student. 
  	“Gravity is a phenomenon caused by the attraction of objects for each other. The force field protects this plane from things that might puncture it, such as our bodies when we fly with it” 
  	“Doesn’t this make it more like gravity?” asked another student. “Well you’re right but there’s still a difference” replied Mumford."," Moments later, they were flying through the air. Mumford saw things differently. ""This feels wrong,"" Mumford says. ""It looks like we're falling"". The students' view of gravity hadn't been tainted by the lure of wealth, fame and fortune.

In the centre of the aircraft, a giant sphere surrounded by a ring of smaller spheres spin and slowly descend. ""Gravity doesn't work here"", Mumford explains.

""The sphere is actually a wind tunnel. It's designed to give you weightlessness by mimicking Earth's atmosphere. These bigger spheres will help us generate the wind required in the wind tunnel. This will help us test our theories of aerodynamics"".

""But what I see doesn't look like you see on TV. We're falling"".

""No, the pilot's right. This feels wrong, it's not supposed to feel like this"".

They're approaching the outer layer of spheres. The students notice that they are falling even more rapidly. The sphere is moving faster and faster. Mumford calls out to the pilot, who looks up from his monitor, clearly taken by surprise. He struggles to make his voice heard over the noise of the aircraft. ""You've gotta slow down. We're going to crash!"", Mumford shouts. 
But the KC-135 pilot is having none of it. He's a man on a mission, and isn't going to stop till he achieves his"," The tanker’s wings, engines, landing gear and tail unit were all new, but the Boeing 707 airframe had been in service for almost 40 years. But the exterior seemed completely different from the outside. The new wings, engines, landing gear and tail unit all contained weightlessness devices. The Boeing 707’s four engines were still there but were out of use. It was not much of an aircraft when it was used to fly around for pleasure. It sat on the tarmac since the 1970s. But the tanker had a new purpose, to fly over hostile land and over water to deliver millions of litres of jet fuel for the US military. When the KC-135 landed, the jet fuel started to flow out and an astronaut who had been standing on the flight deck came running down the stairs. “Wow,” he said. “That is really heavy,” said one of the students. “No, it is not,” replied the astronaut. “There is no weight in weightlessness,” he said. He was right, and soon the students realised that when weightless there was no weight at all. Tom Mumford, journalist Tom, who was a passenger in the KC-135, is now a pilot himself, as a member of the US Navy and has used the jet fuel weightlessness devices to land an aircraft on the ocean, without any fueling stops, using only weightlessness. His passenger’s certificate of qualification came through at the end of his flight."," He then powered up the engines, and the three-person crew pulled out of the hangar. The KC-135 rose gracefully into the air. But then Mumford noticed something strange: the floor was descending. It didn't feel like the plane was in freefall. He couldn't explain it. Then, the KC-135 suddenly leveled off. His seat began to vibrate, and he knew something was wrong. The pilot had told them that they would not feel weightless, but Mumford felt nauseous. The plane was actually going down. And fast.

Mumford knew then that there was something seriously amiss. His professor, Dr. Sutherland, told him that the pilot was trying to land the KC-135 on a wing, but was hitting bumps in the sky that were causing the plane to pitch over. It was looking like a real nightmare, but Mumford knew he couldn't let it go. He had to be at his desk at 9 am. So he pulled his head back into the spacecraft, grabbed the camera, and jumped out the plane's side door.

The KC-135's belly slammed into the earth with a thunderous noise. A huge cloud of dust and smoke billowed up around it. Mumford waited for his heart to stop racing, and then he turned to see if any of the students had been injured. He was shocked to see that none of them were hurt. They were all laughing."," “OK, I'm feeling a bit light headed”, complained the youngest member of the party, “I hope you didn't put anything too strenuous in my hand luggage”.  “Relax Tom”, replied the pilot. “All systems are go for lift off” and off they go, climbing steadily at about 500 feet, a little faster than Alpine skiers.   Once the pilot opens the canopy the student realise that they are in the nose of a different aircraft, it’s weightless. In the background, they can hear the KC-135’s fuel and fuel distribution system.
  But it is not what they see that strikes them. As they enter the weightlessness they have a feeling of falling through the sky. The KC-135's fuel begins to fill the atmosphere and the student realise that the Boeing 707 they are in has a large propulsive force, greater than the gravitational force of the earth. Their bodies begin to change as the force pulls water out of their cells and mixes with the gas that makes up their bodies.   
  And, although still in the Boeing 707, they begin to rise. The students look around amazed at the changes, their head is no longer, now it is a balloon, their limbs have become longer, and they begin to feel warm. As they ascend, the pilot reminds them of the dangers of weightlessness, telling them that they could suffer from space sickness or even pass out. The student take in all"," 

They stepped into the capsule and Mumford saw first hand how weightlessness worked. He was floating towards the ceiling in seconds, and it looked like gravity was just an illusion. The feeling of weightlessness was exhilarating and he realised that science was correct; gravity didn’t exist.

The capsule landed and Mumford looked out the window. He saw a huge area of farmland and thousands of acres of woods, it looked like New England. He soon realised where he was, it was Massachusetts. His first thought was “this is incredible; this is like a dream”. 

As he walked around the plane he realised it was a true mockup of the Boeing 707, the cargo door was also the same. He thought how amazing it was how NASA had been able to create a true reproduction of the 707. 

He joined the other journalists in the cockpit where they were conducting tests on the area they had landed in. 

The jet looked like it had been restored, the floors were wood too, and they all took a moment to look around. Then the pilot announced they were ready to begin their first test flight. 

Tom went back into the capsule, they had agreed to meet back at the plane for their first flight at 5pm, and he had to go home. It was now 7pm and he would be late. 

He strapped himself in and waited a couple of minutes before the capsule lifted off. As it rose up"," When Tom, a freelance journalist, stepped inside the aircraft, it was like being inside a different craft altogether. The floor was made of a reflective material, but it looked more like a firm surface than hard ground. He turned to his neighbour, a lanky 16-year-old boy from the University of Warwick, and said: ""this must be how planes used to feel"". He had been reading about weightlessness in books and on the internet, but had never imagined he would go to space. ""There's nothing like it,"" said Mumford, a veteran of several space flights, ""and it's not because you float like a balloon. You can walk, you can move, you can do all the things you would do in normal space"". It was an astonishing experience and a great learning opportunity, but as soon as the doors closed and the engines cut, he knew the ground had come back into sight.

Tom Mumford is a veteran of several space flights and journalist who joined students in weightlessness in a KC-135 refuelling tanker. It was an astonishing experience for Tom and a great learning opportunity but as soon as the doors closed and the engines cut, he knew the ground had come back into sight. Using basic sentence patterns, Mumford memorised phrases like ""it must be how planes used to feel"" and ""this must be how planes used to feel"". He also explicitly informed the learner of the gravity"
"

In the city of El Escorial, north of Madrid, just north of the beautiful Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range, I once again came face to face with the master. I knew his work, the ‘Guernica’ of the 1930s. But when I saw him leaving his house on that sunny afternoon, walking to the villa of his neighbours where there was no doubt he would eat a traditional Moroccan lunch, it really was as if I was experiencing a dream. 

Picasso was in his element. He was dressed for the sunshine, a white shirt with cufflinks, a dark suit, and I saw him reach for a glass of red wine. He was unabashedly gawping at the pretty women passing by, taking in his surroundings.

Later that afternoon, and still unable to believe what had happened, I visited the Museum of Antiquities in El Escorial, where the masterpiece ‘Las Meninas’ was on display. The painting of a young portrait of Charles V was even more remarkable in person, I was once more taken aback.

Over the years the encounter with Picasso will remain an unforgettable experience. I will always remember his eyes, bright with intelligence and the joy of creation. We also had a nice chat about the city, and I remember him telling me that he had moved back to Madrid from Paris in the 1940s when he was sixteen years old.


Picasso was"," When we drove past a huge crowd was gathered on the quayside where we had taken up a berth for the night. At first I thought they were waiting for a ship and was confused to see men in jackets and trousers while the women were in headscarves.

As the boat approached, we could make out that the gathered crowd was of artists, all with their easels. I asked my father who they were but he wouldn't tell me. The following morning we set off from our hotel in Marrakesh at first light and as the miles slipped by I began to wonder if the artists we had seen the previous night were actually on their way to a ship in the sea. It didn't take long to realise they were not heading to Morocco's main port. When we eventually arrived in the city it was not long before I spotted a crowd gathered around the harbour. I was astounded to see that they were not there for the arrival of a ship, but instead for the arrival of Picasso himself.

When he walked up to the end of the jetty the murmur that went up from the crowd was almost deafening. I had never seen such a stir on land or sea. In front of the gathered artists and the media entourage who arrived in taxis it was the most famous man in the world and he was clearly unimpressed by the salutation he got from the port mayor. He appeared annoyed, although that is not quite"," When we arrived at our overnight stop in Cannes Picasso was nowhere to be seen. However when the van set off again the following morning, Picasso had returned. The following day we spent a morning with him in the beautiful surroundings of La Croisette where he exhibited his famous bulls and dolphins. He would often sit down and paint us from the side of the street and it was with a mix of awe and suspicion that we realised he was not a caricaturist. It was another couple of weeks before we saw another of his great masterpieces, Les Femmes d'Alger, at the Louvre museum. 

The next time we saw Picasso was in the early 1970s in Barcelona. We found him living in a squalid hovel and working on a hauntingly dark, intense and abstract series of paintings. He had become a political exile from Franco's Spain. It was there that he painted three of his most famous pictures, Guernica, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and Les Femmes d'Alger. Picasso was then 77 years old.


Guernica, the fate of war in Picasso's eyes, is a monumental canvas of a city in ruin, planes, falling buildings and people running. Guernica was painted in the wake of the Spanish Civil War and shows Picasso's lifelong fascination with the human condition in war. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is a famous"," We had travelled a long way and arrived at the restaurant to find that we had missed lunch. It was then that I saw the real Picasso. “I was so excited. I went over to the artist and put out my hand and he looked at me for a long time. Then he said to me, ‘Are you a painter?’ I replied, ‘No, I am an student!’ and he laughed and shook my hand as he went off to lunch. That is the moment that I realised who Picasso was, and I have been in awe of him ever since.”


From the prompt, we can see that Cork was a 78-year-old student when he encountered Picasso, so we can assume Cork is in his early 30s. The reading grade scale supports this because the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for Grade 2 is 7.2.

Cork describes his encounter with Picasso as being ""the moment that I realised who Picasso was"", and ""in awe of him ever since"". Both of these phrases describe complex emotions using simple language. ""In awe of him ever since"" is a metaphorical expression that describes Cork's emotions towards Picasso. In contrast, Picasso is the object of Cork's emotions, and the event caused these emotions.

Another example of the use of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is in this passage from a New Yorker article about the presidential election in the United States:"," I was driving along a lonely, dusty track in the middle of nowhere when we came across a vast painting of a woman with a flower in her hair. I recognised her immediately, it was one of Picasso's blue period paintings, and the driver, knowing his art, identified it as being of his wife Jacqueline. This was in 1939, shortly after the couple had met and fallen in love while Picasso was in Paris. 

Within a few months of the couple's meeting Picasso had returned to his native Spanish town of Figueras and plunged himself into the local art scene. He had been one of the local painter's greatest champions, supporting a range of new artists at a time when Figueras was emerging as a center of post-Impression art. Through his wife Jacqueline, who worked for a local family, Picasso was introduced to the wealthy industrialist Baron Hilla von Fischbeck who in turn helped him acquire the lease of a large dilapidated castle, now a prestigious art school. In 1946 the couple returned to their home in Cannes and built a vast, modern art studio with a swimming pool and tennis court on the grounds of their home. 

Picasso's work continued to grow throughout the 1950s with his first one-man shows in Paris, Rome and New York. Yet even as the most celebrated Spanish artist of the century emerged as a multi-millionaires his life was dogged by personal conflict. Picasso"," For two weeks we had been following an easy route via Bordeaux, Marseille and Timbuktu and it felt as though we had been driving for days. As we approached the coast we stopped to refill the van's gas tank. Picasso was there, leaning against a tree, smoking a cigarette. He offered to share his lunch. He asked me if I was a student, I told him I was 78 years old. We started talking about art and he invited me to sit by him. He explained that he had been diagnosed with cancer 10 years earlier, but had coped with it with the help of art. As we talked we were joined by a large pack of dogs attracted by the carrion. Picasso turned to me and asked me to take a picture of him. We took our pictures, Picasso signalled to me to turn my head. He asked me to look into the camera so he could see my eyes and then he asked me to close my eyes. As I started to close my eyes, the dogs ran away and when I looked back at him his expression was different, he was smiling! He said ‘it is very dangerous to speak to strangers, especially ones as young as you are’. We talked more about art and he asked me if I liked any of his works. He was particularly known for his portraits of his mistress and the dogs. I told him I liked one of his portraits of his mistress. He told me the dog"," Picasso had just completed the last of his multi-decade cycles of changing style, as exemplified by works such as Las Meninas, one of the paintings in his Guernica series and the famous portrait The Three Graces. I was struck by the vitality in his eyes, the spring in his step, the boldness of his strokes and, from a distance, I recall thinking, 'That's a great painting.' 

The prompt requires a basic sentence pattern, phrases memorised from life and the use of explicit information. The example story could include the following sentence pattern: 

""Picasso"" and ""Richard Cork"" together form a proper noun in the text; the sentence uses ""eye"" and ""spring"" to explain how Cork came to be eating his lunch ""at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour"".

The passage above satisfies the following requirements:

It uses basic sentence patterns, i.e. noun-phrase+pronoun/preposition, and also contains phrases that Cork used to explain how he came to be eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour: ""the spring in his step, the boldness of his strokes and, from a distance, I recall thinking, 'That's a great painting.'

The passage also contains explicit information that could be assessed using the CEFR level 1 (basic information) point: ""I recall thinking 'That's a great painting.'"".

" The growth of the Internet and other new media has outpaced advertising spending. In fact, it's possible that the rate of change of information and communication technology could outpace advertising spending as a whole for many years to come. 

There are lots of examples of mass marketed goods that have struggled to keep up with changes in technology. Personal computers and then the Internet were both late to the data communication party. But, marketers were able to figure out how to reach a mass audience and capitalize on the technology. Even though the personal computer failed to keep up, the fact that personal computers could connect to the Internet and allow for a new breed of uses opened up markets and new industries for the computer.

Advertising is unlikely to recover if it hasn't begun to yet. The Internet alone will probably change advertising enough to negate past returns. It has been a disruptive technology that has challenged how people research information and created new needs for advertising. The advertising model has to evolve to account for the pace of change. And advertising is only one part of a broader marketing organization that needs to rethink their focus. Advertising and marketing as a profession is in trouble.

A great example of a successful product with new technology as a disruption is Polaroid. Polaroid cameras, which produced instant photos, were an obvious disruptive technology to compete with other cameras that produced photos more quickly. However, Polaroid's success was due more to their marketing than their technology. Polaroid sold the"," It has gotten progressively more expensive to run ads as the technology to deliver them has gotten progressively cheaper and consumers get more ad-blocked. What Went Wrong? Advertising has always tried to get the consumer to buy the product or service it is selling. In past economic expansions, this worked quite well - advertising created brand loyality that continued to increase profits year over year for the industry or sponsor. In past decades, advertising also created a climate that fostered innovation. The innovation, itself, often made the advertising more relevant and more effective. The modern media landscape and rapid communication in the 20th century made it possible to have timely, relevant and interactive advertising. Advertising is relatively cheap compared to many other forms of production. For these reasons, and because television advertising rates are fixed and cannot be changed, advertising has continued to rise year over year in both dollars spent and effect on the economy. However, advertising is also the cause of many ills. The modern media landscape also means that it is easily accessible to all people and is almost constantly being changed by consumers, who are more aware and more ad-blocked than they were in past decades. The recent rise in advertising has also led to higher prices for goods and services due to the fact that much advertising is for goods and services not available outside of advertising driven consumption. There is a limit to how much advertising a person can take before their ability to think and make informed decisions diminishes. In past decades, advertising was often called"," What went wrong? 

There are a number of factors that could be blamed. However, in my opinion the one factor which caused advertising to fail to keep up with change is the one-size-fits-all marketing approach.

From the 1960s onwards marketers started to recognise the one-size-fits-all marketing approach had limitations and, instead, should move away from this approach and start to think more creatively about how to reach customers with their message. In the 1980s the FMCG (food and beverages) industry developed a range of innovative products which attracted customers to their range. Advertising did not initially recognise the value in these new products and so did not develop to match the demand for new products. In the 1990s and 2000s marketers developed and used a range of new tools to connect with customers such as the Internet, mobile phones and e-mail. Yet, until the financial crisis, they kept using the same one-size-fits-all marketing approach which did not recognise the need for change and the difference in behaviour between individuals. 

The recession has exposed the limitations of the one-size-fits-all marketing approach and since then, advertisers have begun to develop more tailored or personalised approaches to their campaigns. Personalisation focuses on tailoring the message to the interests, needs and attitudes of the individual. In order to personalise their campaigns, advertisers must have a clear understanding of the individual customer and how their needs and desires"," Advertising has not adapted fast enough to the changing patterns of buying. Advertising's core assumptions about the buying process are no longer accurate. 

There are 3 core assumptions made by advertising: 

1. People have a finite amount of attention 
2. People are price sensitive 
3. People are rational 

All three assumptions are invalid today. 

1. The finite amount of attention approach does not apply to the media explosion of digital information and experiences. 
2. The price sensitivity approach does not apply to the low transaction costs of information exchange. 
3. The rational approach does not apply to the diversity of choices available to consumers and businesses. 

There are many ways to sell goods and services that are not covered by the three assumptions: 

1. Experience 
2. Personal recommendation
3. Indirect models (like brand loyality)


The advertising industry has recognised the shortcomings of the three core assumptions and is starting to move toward new models based on the Four Pillars of Selling framework. The Four Pillars of Selling are: 
1.The Offer 
2.The Problem Statement
3.The Opportunity
4.The Solution 


The advertising industry acknowledges that these assumptions no longer apply and is moving away from them. Here are some advertising innovations that have caught on: 

1. Experience advertising. Many industries, such as travel, entertainment, retail, and health, are experimenting with"," This is not good for consumers. This is not good for producers. 

The decline in advertising can be seen around the world. In the UK advertising fell by almost 10% between May and August this year. The decline was much steeper in the advertising heartlands of the US. Advertising revenue in the US fell by 11.4% in the first half of this year. Advertising also appears to have become a less relevant way of selling goods and services. A recent survey shows that two-thirds of British adults believe advertising to be either very or fairly ineffective. Even so, many marketers still say they cannot afford not to spend money on advertising.

Advertising has always been a double edged sword. It provides a way for producers to get consumers to pay for their services or products. But consumers will only tolerate so much over-consumption. Advertising has often been too blatant, for example Coca Cola's ""The more you drink the faster you move"" campaign from the 1950's. So too many marketers spend too much on ""creative"" advertising. This is not only expensive it is also limited in effectiveness. 

So what is the answer? We could hope that advertising will improve in the future. This is unlikely. There isn't enough money to go round for all the people who would like to spend it. There isn't sufficient demand for advertising either. Consumers no longer believe it is an effective way of purchasing goods and services"," Advertising was supposed to be able to meet this challenge by moving from a ""mass"" medium to a ""special"" medium - television, where the audience was already ""mass"" and thus easier to reach - to a ""special"" medium such as the internet which did not require the mass audience. Advertising did not have this luxury. The internet was not widely available and television was the ""mass"" medium which advertising could piggyback off of. Advertising had an uphill battle with television. Mass media has always been a challenging arena for advertising. We were warned of the difficulties back in 1982 with the release of a film entitled ""King's Row"". Advertising against mass media, as mass media was then called, had always proven challenging. The film was a triumph for advertising.  Facing an uncertain future, advertising took a page from its past and tried to break into the new media of radio and television. Radio had been advertising's mainstay for decades, but with the rise of the FM band came the rise of the more specialized AM band which, until recently, had been radio's worst enemy.  So radio changed to accommodate the new FM band by adding more music radio stations to the format, and by reducing talk radio and news. Advertising also fought to bring viewers to television. Programming executives were understandably reluctant to take a chance on a TV spot in the doldrums of television advertising when a commercial could not be returned immediately and was unlikely to be watched."," It has relied too much on traditional forms that don't resonate with the dynamism of the market. The problem has been worse in the United States. There, advertising is dominated by big business and their advertising agencies. They have set the advertising standards in the US, and the industry has followed. Advertising agencies control the message. They pay the stars big bucks to endorse their clients. You have no idea how much I hate ads. But that is the way it is. They are good at what they do. Advertising has become the same as a long, drawn out party where you dance to the same, tired routine all night. Advertising can be a great force for change. It can change attitudes, create new markets and sell products. I remember as a kid when I saw the first Super Bowl. I thought everyone in America had a television. Advertising created mass markets and the internet, and Google is an advertising agency. Advertising has failed to respond to the changing pace of economic change. It has failed to move with the times, and has stuck to methods that have become obsolete. It uses old advertising standards, which are now simply not relevant in the market economy. Advertising needs to do two things to succeed:  use new methods that resonate with the times; and use explicit information to communicate the message. The world of advertising is dominated by big business and their advertising agencies. They have set the advertising standards and so the industry has followed. The problem is that"

Georgina McGuiness was a 40 something reporter at an Australian morning newspaper.  She had grown up in the suburbs of Sydney but had always thought of herself as being more “at the heart of things” - in her pajamas, reading a morning paper when everyone else had woken up. This had been true throughout most of her 20s and 30s when she was based in Sydney and Johannesburg. However, a few years ago her marriage had ended and over the last 6 months, she had been juggling the end of maternity leave with the need to find another job. 

Georgina is very smart and had always thought that the combination of her personality and her brainpower would see her to the top. It hadn't worked out but, as a woman with a professional background, things had started looking up.

At the age of 43 she bought the home of her childhood dreams, a large house in the country with a big, open plan kitchen/dining/living area and 4 bedrooms. She had done research and learnt that the appliances (including the dishwasher) needed to be of the appropriate size, the pipes were fitted, the electricity line was in, all the electrical sockets were installed and the electrical wiring done.

Georgina had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. She recounts here how she was able to transform the family home into an efficient workplace.

After 15 years in which she had worked mainly for digital media organisations, Georgina McGuiness had taken a break from journalism to spend time with her family. She loved the calm and the peace that came from being at home and she was able to spend time with her family while also creating an efficient workspace.

The family home had been Georgina’s office. She had converted one spare bedroom in the house into a workspace where she could develop software and use the latest technology. She installed two computers, an Apple and a Windows laptop, both with large monitors, a data projector, a virtual reality goggles, high speed internet and a fax machine. The family home had an enormous office with room for everyone to work at the same time, which suited her personality as well as the wide range of clients and projects that were coming her way.

Georgina’s friends and family were amazed at how much she had achieved in such a short space of time. The clients were happy with the level of service they received and they loved how easy it was to contact Georgina. She was an incredibly responsive and friendly agent. 

A few weeks after she had returned to work after her sabbatical, the local Sunday Times had run a","
She started by removing all the electronic devices that she no longer used like the television and stereo. She then cleaned the house from top to bottom and replaced the curtains with blinds, allowing the natural light to filter into the home.
She then installed a phone, internet and broadband connection. Georgina also purchased various productivity applications that she could use from her phone in the office. 
She even set up a Microsoft Office 365 account that she could use remotely from her home computer.  
Georgina even hired a virtual assistant, who she now refers to as a'shadow', to complete tasks on her behalf from her home computer. This way Georgina could use her office space whilst also working from home. She could access both of these services using her Microsoft account.   
Within 2 weeks of setting up her office in her home, Georgina was able to resume her career as a journalist.  Her productivity significantly increased and she was able to complete the same workload in half the time. She was also happier and inspired at work as she was able to stay connected with colleagues in real-time without needing to commute to the office.

Georgina has now hired a virtual assistant to help with some of the more complex administrative tasks.  This allows her to spend more time with her family whilst still being able to achieve the same workload remotely.

In 1995, Georgina McGuiness, a seasoned journalist who had been based in London for many years, had a career break and moved with her family to Ballyheigue, a small village in County Cavan, Ireland. It was then that she realised the advantages of being located in a remote location. She had grown bored of the daily routine of the metropolitan life and wanted to be close to the outdoors and the community of her roots. 

She began by hiring a local handyman to carry out simple maintenance tasks for the house. This spurred a wave of local tradesmen to contact Georgina in search of work, and she was soon earning income by doing minor DIY work around the home. This work went from strength to strength, and within a year, Georgina was able to return to her old career as a full-time journalist for a local Irish newspaper. 

Her success came not only from having the right contacts, but also from putting the right infrastructure in place. She worked with an architect, who designed a website for Georgina that enabled the former journalist to continue her work from the home, while also giving her a platform to promote her handyman and local business. 

The website was hosted on a private dedicated server, and Georgina had a remote desktop access on a laptop. This helped her be able to work from home, train and develop new business relationships in a scalable manner. By 2006, her firm, ""Georgina Mc"
" The answer, once again, is yes.

You can write about any aspect of Charles Darwin, but make sure you include a direct reference to Whipsnade. The park is best known for its fantastical animal displays and is home to many of the most well-known species in the world, including the elusive panda bear, the largest primate. The park is also well known for its peacocks, and in particular, for the trains that run down each bird’s back, a quaint and unique feature that is both entertaining for visitors to the park and useful for identifying each bird on sight.

This train is what is known as a tail train, and is a unique feature that differentiates the peacocks from all other birds. Tail trains run along the back of the peacocks like a train and can often be seen during the summer. This train consists of about 70 feet of train with an alternating sequence of red and blue feathers, and is the most recognizable feature of the peacocks.

The peacocks roam free at the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire and are not caged. They are free to roam the park at will, including on the paths, leading to the main entrance and the park’s animal attractions. This affords the peacocks the opportunity to interact with visitors, which the birds seem to enjoy. In fact, on certain summer days, the peac"," He had answered himself that birds must have the same power dressing that all animals have been selected for: for colouring, for fighting ability, for feeding or even just to attract a mate. That is why he went to the great lagoons of the Tropics and to remote islands such as the Galapagos to witness the astonishing array of bird feathers; that is why he examined the rich colouring of the hummingbirds or why he spent many hours in the aviaries of the great Dutch ornithologist Klaas Meuris.

However, the peacocks have their story to tell and although their train is magnificent it was not given by nature but by human intervention. In 1817 a local pea-shooter, John Gilbert, had the idea of breeding peacocks which he did in his atelier with results that the public would admire. Thus the peacocks, descended from their master Gilbert, roam free across the UK and in 1819 the first public exhibition was organised at Whipsnade. However, in 1848 when the park was bought by the taxidermist W.G.S.Moulton the peacocks were exterminated. By 1900 every last one of them had perished - not only through hunting, but also through human intervention. 

The last remaining peacock, Tippoo, is an almost a living museum. He can still perform his train act and his feathers"," 

This is a great story from the award-winning book The Story of St Peter by Andrew Davies (published by Fourth Estate).


Here is the text of the story:

POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? 

These peacocks, unlike our fowls, are free to roam in a natural world so extensive, so varied and, so they say, so beautiful that their trains, those outsize tails, their trains - their power-dressing - seem almost to outpace their own legs. 

For the Darwinian explanation of this phenomenon, the peacocks must simply be doing their best to display to their best advantage the plumage, tail feathers, and train that is their due, just as, with other creatures, natural selection causes some to display their genetic best: the one with the largest bill; the ones with the longest legs, strongest feet and so on - the best that they can be. 

The explanation may indeed be no more than a matter of natural selection and the peacocks may indeed do their best to"," How is it that the elegant tail of a peacock, when held at half-tension would span twelve feet and the train, which is but a plumes of down hanging limply from the neck of each peacock, seems designed to out-dance even the dancer in its eyes? 

There is much scientific debate on the subject of birds that perform ""dancing"" with their primary feathers in a flapping motion that has similarities to that of humans. The research in this field is still in its relative infancy. However, it is interesting to note that in cultures around the world there are stories about birds that dance. This could suggest that birds have instinctive behaviors that can be observed by humans. 

There is even evidence of the use of birdsong in healing during the Stone Age. The use of birdsong in healing has been recorded from 14,000 years BP in the Acheulean culture. The Acheulean culture has given way to the Chaco culture which is also recorded to have used birds in healing.


In this story I will explore the question of how birds could have evolved such an obvious extravagance? I will explore Charles Darwin's original idea of how natural selection could have produced such a complex behavior. Through the use of graphs and statistics I will compare the complexity of feathers in peacocks to other birds to other animals. I will also compare the complexity of train trains in peacocks to humans who also ""d"," 

In his youth, Charles Darwin was an avid zookeeper and was inspired to study the peacock's train as a means of understanding the beauty of the bird's display of ornate tail feathers. Having discovered that the train consisted of plumes of pink, blue, green and yellow feathers, he was surprised that the train was not red - the color of blood. The brilliant example of nature's extravagance was a revelation to Darwin, but years passed and he died without a reply to the mystery of the train's redemptive splendor.

Darwin would certainly have savored the discovery of this century-old mystery, but in the final years of his life, the peacock's train was not red but white. It was discovered that an infection in the animal's foot had robbed it of its prized pink feathers. The scientific community agreed that Darwin had died frustrated but also that he had died convinced that one day a satisfying answer would be found to this still outstanding puzzle.


One day a biologist, now 90 years old, was admiring a dead peacock with its impressive train when he noticed a large patch on the bird's white tail that was red like the rest of the train. Curious, the scientist carefully probed the patch until he found hundreds of white and pink feathers of the pink type that had escaped the peacock's foot when it was placed in a tub of pink dye at the age of eight.

"," In the end his conclusion that they must have been gifted was as much a consolation as it was a vindication.

The peacocks in the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park - just like the ones Darwin studied - are free to fly at will and run amok. It is their play-fighting that entertains and delights the paying public that arrive each day from around the county. This spectacle has only taken off because of the generosity of a private donor who saw the park's potential and has gone on to underwrite its running costs through to make possible the park's highly successful television show, ‘The Wilds’.

The park's director, Mike Pitts, and the charity’s animal care and welfare manager, Gemma Williams, see it as their mission to ensure the continued survival of these magnificent creatures. In a recent radio interview they declared that “there’s nothing wrong with having a few quid”.

But there is something wrong with having a few quid if the zoo goes down the pan. The zoo has lost a significant amount of money in recent years - its most recent accounts reveal debts of over half a million pounds. And the peacocks, with their spectacular show of feathers, have long been a source of worry to those concerned for the future of the zoo. The park's website tells us that “without a doubt the most talked about animal at the park is the peacocks. It is this fabled,"," 

The peacocks are wild and a species at risk. They are part of a captive breeding programme to preserve them in the wild, and their magnificent trains are a testament to their hard won survival. 

The trains are made up of a myriad of feathers, some plain, some colour coordinated with their plumage to match their sex: hen pullets tend to colour their trains with pink, the peacocks’ trains are often a blazing red, and white to match the peacocks. 

Exposed to the harsh elements and the hen pecking order the train is the peacocks’ extravagance. This dress was bought and paid for with their hard won survival, a lifetime’s worth of feeding and care.

The hen pecking order also means the hen that has the highest opinion of the peacock’s train will receive attention by the peacocks’ owners, who have often spent years nurturing this wild species into a captive bred programme. This attention comes in the form of a treat, the hen that receives frequent treats wins the peacock’s affection, and his protective and loyal embrace. 

Exposure to the hen’s gaze exposes the train to the elements and the hen no longer has to worry about losing her precious egg to the peacock’s teeth. With the hen’s egg safely inside the peacock’s incubator the hen’s fate is no longer in peril"
" But as the saying goes, the rest is history, and human history has not been kind to people who were too bright, or too greedy, or too fond of reading novels. Some of the cruelest rulers the human race has known were undoubtedly the smartest.


Humans can be very cruel and unkind, we’ve also developed some of our greatest skills and abilities through the evolution. From intelligent tool-making to writing, mathematics, and language.


This is a fascinating point of view, that we are still biologically similar to our ancestors. It’s true that there has been a lot of evolution over the past seven million years, but the differences are still very small. I wonder if what made us different from other species caused so much suffering.


I want to think of this as a bittersweet discovery. I want to believe we have some innate difference that makes us different to animals, but I want to acknowledge that this discovery makes me feel less special. It feels like I’ve been missing something all along.


“Humans can be very cruel and unkind, we’ve also developed some of our greatest skills and abilities through the evolution.”

I want to feel special, but now I’m not sure.


Do you think that intelligent tool-making, literacy, and numeracy are just a result of evolution or are they a uniquely human trait?


Do you think this is a positive or negative discovery"," Which means that whether we like it or not, whether we’re good at our jobs or not, whether we’re rich or poor, we’re all natural talents.

  * You are"," Yet in the business world it seems like nature hasn’t really favored human talent. Most companies spend money on established, veteran employees, while we spend lavishly to attract and nurture the newest, brightest talents. So what gives? Why are companies spending so much money on nurturing and rewarding established employees, while at the same time they seem to be losing out to companies that do more to attract and develop younger talent? What’s going on? We may never fully understand why companies are failing to tap the full potential of their human talent resources. And it’s not as if any one company is solely to blame. After all, talent recruitment isn’t really a one-size-fits-all solution. What works for one company may not be right for another. So let’s examine some of the options available to companies looking to attract and develop talent, and what they all have in common.

1. Offer benefits to employees that are specifically designed to attract and develop young talent.

One way to try to tap into the pool of young, eager talent in a business is to offer them additional benefits, above and beyond the ones that are routinely available to other employees. These benefits might include things like competitive salaries or stock options to encourage them to develop their skills, flexible working arrangements or benefits to encourage them to take time off to participate in activities that develop their skills, or benefits to help them relocate to a new location if that’s what it takes"," While many animals are naturally talented, none are naturally talented in every area. So there must have been things about our early human ancestors that set them apart. Where could they have been genetically different from chimpanzees? The list is almost limitless. Chimpanzees are much smarter than we are, have language, advanced tools and weapons, social behaviour and complex cultures. But if we compare all those traits to just two: our size and number of bones in our arm joints, we are indeed very much like chimpanzees. It’s those other differences that set us apart. For example, chimpanzees are shorter-lived than we are and so it’s not surprising that human longevity could be a genetic trait. As our ancestors moved around more than other animals they had to cope with changes in climate, so perhaps our ability to adjust to those changes and reproduce regularly could have evolved because we’re more able to grow hair on our bodies. And in contrast to the way other animals scratch their noses, humans are more comfortable scratching a itch the way you are right now. And we don’t just scratch it. We can also sew, build, write and read. So there must be something about our other natural talents, abilities and behaviours that makes it possible to survive and thrive as a species. And although it’s hard to see what that might be, perhaps the human brain is uniquely suited to these traits and so has become the driving"," The great evolutionary psychologist Frans de Waal believes that this lack of natural talent probably explains why humans tend to misbehave. 
Frans de Waal is the author of many acclaimed books about human behaviour and has dedicated the past decade or so to trying to understand why we behave the way we do. In his view our in-born curiosity, our ability to learn from our mistakes, our instinctive empathy and our capacity for social innovation and improvisation give us an inherent capacity for bad behavior and, more usually, for spectacularly good behavior. Humans have a tendency to think for ourselves, he argues, to question the status quo and to be boldly original and unconventional. 
  But why? De Waal believes that our inborn capacity for empathy has equipped us with an innate ability to understand and even to empathize with others, at least to the extent we have the same genome as our forebears. This explains, he believes, why human beings can be so cruel to one another, why we are driven by ambition and even why we are fascinated by war, as this can be understood as a form of contest. Yet this same curiosity and impulsivity could lead to the success of many ambitious or eccentric individuals. 
So what is it about us that makes us so prone to go wrong? De Waal’s answer is our inherent capacity for natural talent, our innate capacity to show natural talent and his term for this is “spontaneous"," It seems likely that natural talents include our ability to make and use tools, to communicate using speech or other forms of language and to develop the cultural skills that make it possible to organise and manage societies. But what about our aversion to pain or our big brains? These may be the by-products of natural talents, rather than their cause.

From being able to work out what things are for, to the knack of spotting patterns, to being able to communicate, to understanding our own bodies and the world around us, to being great at maths and science and music, we have a wide range of talents. These may seem mysterious or random to outsiders, but a growing body of scientific research suggests there is a genetic component to these talents. 

One of the areas where our differences appear is in our brain: our frontal lobes, which are the part of our brains used for complex planning and problem-solving, are different to those in other animals. Research suggests we may be unique because we have developed an extra layer of DNA that has protected our unique brain from damage, protecting our unique talents. 

Scientists are still piecing together our different talents, but one area we have a genetic knack for is learning from what we’ve observed. We can remember things much better than other animals. Scientists also think our brains may have evolved to be able to recognise patterns, and as a result we can recognise connections between events or between objects which other animals might not. 

We are still very much animals, but with the right DNA we can improve our abilities. One day we could be the smartest species in the world.

In 2006 Robin set out from Land’s End in the United Kingdom on a circumnavigation of the world. He completed the trip in 24 months. When he reached the Arctic Circle he left everything behind and walked northwards in Inuit clothes. His story was featured in the 2019 BBC Two program Life Story. What was your experience like?

Chris Bonnington: Robin Knox-Johnston had become a close friend of mine when we were both trainees at Mount Everest in the 80’s. After the first summit attempt in 1981, Robin, who was also a climber, left the South Col with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Chris Bonnington was the only Brit left in the Nepalese Support Team. Robin reached the South Col one more time and waited for Chris in thequeue. They had established a warm relationship by then and Robin was able to convince Chris to climb with the Support Team with his gear and supplies. Robin had also just completed a circumnavigation of the world. As he was leaving the support team for Nepal he said to me: ""I’ll be back"". I didn’t know at the time what he meant.

Chris Bonnington (58):  There are times when you just have to get out of bed and do what needs to be done. This time I was determined to summit Everest.  

Robin Knox-Johnston (53):  In 1983 Robin spent 4 days trapped in the ice cave at the bottom of the North Western Ice Stream on the mountain while on an Armed Forces expedition. This triggered an ambition of his to climb all the 7000+ Himalayan peaks. He joined forces with Geoff Lloyd, an Alpine Guide who had done several first ascents in the Kangshung Face. The two men left London for Nepal in February 1985. After a false start climbing the west face of Cho Oyo La, they were able to climb the ice cave in May and then reached the South East Ridge route on 27th May.  

Chris Bonnington (58): Robin was determined and had a lot of help from several organisations and people on the mountain.

" I've been feeling quite claustrophobic in that tiny plane. But I bet it would be worth it just to get a better view of this stunning place.'

'Ok. Lenina you wish it was possible for us to bring a plane to this rock face and get a better view. So the first thing to do is to find a plane that will fit into the tiny pocket we have found. I know, you said there was nothing that flew, but the idea of something that could float and be pulled by animals... well you just can't ignore it.'

'There is the dirigible, but that's far too heavy and big for our needs. Besides I'm not sure the animals would be able to pull it. The balloon is another possibility, however that would be even more difficult to control, it has a tendency to dive when there's any wind, and it's also heavy and big. We are in a harsh environment with little resources, we would need every advantage to get the plane here. However I agree we should look into it. Can you find a lighter plane? Or better yet, can you make one?'

Lenina looked at the rock. It was indeed quite smooth and uninteresting. 'But that would still be heavier than a pocket.' she said doubtfully.

'No, it wouldn't, you can make something very light indeed, by making it from nothing but air. I'm on it, lets"," It hurts my feet and makes my legs heavy. This is no place to walk'
Lenina's wish was granted, a small plane was lowered down to the ground from the hovering helicopter, a pilot and passenger stepped out and climbed up into the plane. The pilot began to take off and asked the passenger where they wanted to go. 'Chicago', he replied.
'Chicago? You're going to Chicago? I hate Chicago!', said Lenina furrowing her brow.
'No, you like Chicago. I've always wanted to go there. Maybe you can come with us' said the pilot.
'I hate to leave this place. I'll miss it so much', said Lenina wiping away a tear. 'Please, take me with you. Please, I beg of you.'
The pilot nodded, clipped Lenina onto his hip and took off in the small plane.

Lenina spent the day looking around the large cave and marveling at how far she had travelled into the earth. She watched as the helicopter circled the cave ceiling and took off with its precious passengers in tow. It felt so good to be running again, so good to know she was doing the right thing by running away from the aliens. She knew now the truth of her mother's warning; the truth that all the aliens had planned from the beginning.

She knew then that running would always be her answer, it always had been her answer and she loved it"," Every step hurts, I wish we had a donkey and a wagon to ride on. We could have brought the plane and set it in the middle of the gorge, then a small team of donkeys could have pulled the contraption around the rock. It would be the perfect place to dig our well' Lenina said with a determined look on her face.
'Oh for goodness sakes Lenina!' said Victor with exasperation.  'You can't have a well without a well house and a well house without a well. You can't have a well until you have an entire village to live in next to it and a village without people to do the necessary work to build it. If you're going to do it by hand you can forget about building it at all.'
Lenina looked up, her lower lip beginning to tremble. 'But I really need to have a well and this is the only chance I've got. We don't even have a donkey yet, and even if we did we haven't got the tools to dig the well by hand.' Victor sighed, slumping down in his chair.  'You're going to have to come to terms with the fact that you won't be building a well with the plane.  You might as well start packing all your things to come to the village with me. I'm buying the plane.'
Lenina sighed again, running a hand through her hair in frustration.  'That doesn't help"," It always hurt my feet. But this would have been so much easier for us to just fly. We could have been on our way much sooner.'

Friends and family members often commented on Lenina's ability to take any situation in stride and her level head despite all the craziness that was happening around her.

Lenina was a rock climber and would often refer to the rock face as her home. While climbing, she'd often refer to the rock face by name. When we returned her laptop, Lenina's home was a blank rock face.

Lenina's friends and family members were not convinced that she could take any situation in stride. They thought that she was overly dramatic when a plane that didn't exist crashed and took her with it. They thought she would be upset and crying over the loss of her laptop.

Families and friends should be cautious of what they say around young children as what they say can have a major impact on how children perceive the world around them.

I wonder if Lenina has any brothers or sisters? If so, maybe her favorite name would be Leni. Her dad once said that Lenina's middle name should be Emily or Ellen. Her friend Jane always calls her Len.

Lenina's friends and family members should ask her about her name and consider the name in context. For example, she could explain that Emily and Ellen have nice names and that her name could also be a"," It always makes me tired! I always get a splitting headache, and my feet hurt for days. We could have brought the plane - it would have saved us a lot of walking. And I would have got to meet my favorite book!'. 

Lenina was disappointed as she had loved the books in her latest library trip.

'I will think of this as I am reading my book', she said to herself, and was soon engrossed in the story.

The plane had not arrived as Lenina had thought. She was quite disappointed and spent the rest of the day wishing she could fly.

The next day Lenina looked at her feet. They hurt! It was then that she noticed a tiny red spot on her big toe. Curious, she looked at the spot and noticed a tiny hole in her toe. She knew she had heard about holes in your toes before but this was the first time she had noticed one.

Worrying that she might get bitten by a mosquito, she tried to stop the hole from getting bigger. But it got so bad that she could no longer walk in her bare feet and was rushed to the local health center for treatment.

Hours of painful cleaning with a needle and a special cream fixed the hole. But Lenina still had to wait another week to see the doctor as the hole was so small that it was not considered serious.

The next day Lenina's toe looked"," I hate heights. The air conditioning in the plane would have been great too.'

I don't like walking either, but at least we've got them here now.  We're going to have to get used to that, because there's nowhere else for them to go.  

'Well maybe not here, but they will be OK.  It would have been better to bring the sledges though.'

Lenina looked at the snowy hill they were on and shook her head. 'They'll never get up there.  That's impossible.  Not after today.  I'll need to carry them up, and that's not going to be easy with this hip.  If you want to bring the sledges then you'll have to go without me.'

Lenina looks at her leg and winced.  

'That's OK.  I don't mind.'

The hill looked even harder. Lenina looked at it and sniffed. She'd have to look after the sledges. She wouldn't be able to carry them up, and they weren't much use otherwise.

She glanced up and looked around.  The sun was going down, and it was getting colder.  It would be dark in no time.  She sighed.

'Let's go then.  The sooner we get started the sooner we'll be done.'

Lenina stepped onto the snow and shook the flakes out of her hair."
" It must be sufficiently nutritious, easy to chew, and safe. Chewing gum has been popular for hundreds of years; early Americans chewed wads of it to reduce tension or just for fun. Even President Lincoln once issued a proclamation: “Celebrate Life—Chew Gum!” Chewing gum became a sport at Yale and other Ivy League universities and even though gum chewing is considered classless by today’s standards it has stayed as popular as ever. Now the American chewing gum industry is worth over $17 billion a year, even though studies show it contains fewer than ten calories per stick.


The most interesting part about this article is that gum chewer’s culture has become big business. The writer makes it sound like Americans have a healthy snack, chew and release dopamine, but there’s really only ten calories of goodness in there. It’s interesting to note that a proclamation by a president has saved the chewing gum industry, and that it’s become a classless practice.


I still love chewing gum, but it doesn’t have nearly the same allure anymore. In fact, sometimes I don’t even think of it as a snack anymore. Instead, I associate it with a teenage obsession that seemed like a reasonable way to express your teenage self.


In many ways, this is a sad article, but it’s also a fun read. The writer takes a popular past time and digs"," American chewing gum is regulated like any other food. Each package must list ingredients and declare potential hazards. But in Europe and Australia chewing gum is considered a social activity and is not regulated at all. Chewing gum may seem like a solitary activity but in fact it is the product of generations of collaboration. The gum industry would not be where it is today without an old Chinese custom of offering the sticks of gum as a symbolic offering to ancestors. Chinese people would place a single gum stick in front of each ancestral altar, and after each swallow they would chew the stick in front of the altar as a way of wishing for good fortune. Over time this custom evolved into the American practice of offering an ashtray for the gods of dinners. However it still remains to this day an old Chinese custom that has not been formally adopted by the Chinese government. When it first arrived in China, the Europeans were perplexed. Here was an ancient custom that had clearly existed for many years in China but had never been adopted there. The Europeans were also concerned about the impact of chewing gum in the modern world. They worried it might pose a health risk. These early concerns proved to be unfounded. As the century progressed, the American gum industry convinced itself that its products were safe for consumption. Now the American chewing gum industry is worth around $100 billion, much of which is invested in the research of new flavours, trying to find the next great hit. Gum is a social activity in Europe"," It also has a high sugar content. There is no nutritional value to chewing gum. But the habit has become so embedded into American culture that the FDA has to approve new brands. “That’s a lot of gum,” remarked the student who had to pass the English class. “It’s kind of hard to chew,” noted the girl next to her, who had a gold tooth. “Yeah, I chew with my mouth closed and that sucks,” agreed the guy sitting next to her. “I chew like this,” the girl in the front row demonstrated, while sticking her tongue out and making a chewing motion. “It’s like an art,” observed the boy with the gold tooth. “You have to keep the gum in your mouth so it doesn’t just fall out.” The gum chewer was born in the 1960’s when gum chews became cool. When a band came to town they’d get their share of gum and their instruments would get all gum-stained. “Classless” was the word of the day. The chewing gum-consumer also emerged in the 1970’s when cheap, colorful, bubble gum was introduced. That’s when people chewed too much and it ended up in the sewer. “I know,” the girl with the gold tooth said, “My dentist had to pull my wisdom tooth.” She put down her gum and opened her mouth for inspection. The other kids all laughed and the boy with the gold"," In 1784, John Wesley preached in Georgia and Georgia wasn’t a nation or state but an “Independent British Possession.” That meant chew your gum. Chewing gum was viewed as a sign of the pietistic religious movement. An 18th century Puritan in America noticed the same thing. The American Revolution began that very year and chew-gum became patriotic.  In 1904, the United States introduced “kief” which was high in THC and very popular with the troops at World War I battles. High school students of the 1920s and 30s began using “marihuana” and soon everyone in the country was using some form of it.  Chewing gum became a habit and people chewed twelve million sticks a day.


The passage above begins by outlining the history of chewing gum until the early 1800s. This section is generally accurate.  However, the “Independent British Possession” is not a nation but an “Independent British Possession.”  “British” is an adjective, not a proper noun.  Also, “John Wesley” is not a person, but a title.  It’s important to note the article Wesley when using proper nouns in headlines.  The next part of the passage discusses the early 1800s and states that Americans chewed twelve million sticks of gum per day.  The passage is not entirely clear because it is difficult to discern the time frame covered in"," To make it we add sugar to enhance the texture and flavor. In addition, we find the chemical nitrous, which actually produces an euphoric sensation. Gum has been around for thousands of years and its function is to help regulate your mood. In ancient Rome it was believed that to have a happy face you had to have a bad conscience. The ancient Chinese believed that chewing gum would promote long life. In many parts of the world chewing gum is still a social custom and a way for young people to become friends before they are members of a church or a political party. In America in the 1950s and 1960s chewing gum was actually considered as a form of rebellion. In addition, as more and more people became educated, they no longer trusted chewing gum as a source of information because it was full of false promises, such as, “If you chew it three times a day you will be able to have a flat stomach in no time. Just look at all these celebrities that have flat stomachs”. However, the people that did not trust chewing gum would rather stick to a pack of twenty cigarettes than to a pack of chewing gum. This is why nowadays we can find very few adults with a healthy life style and a good weight. They prefer their candy and soft drinks. The American chewing gum market is worth $100 billion and it has been growing since 1990. Chewing gum today is not an ancient custom anymore and the FDA does not approve of it. In conclusion,"," But gum has been chewed for thousands of years. An analysis of the archaeological record reveals that humans first began chewing bones at least 13,000 years ago, and most scholars believe humans began using gum at least 100 years ago. This makes the modern habit an American innovation. Modern man has more teeth than our ancient ancestors and so he is able to enjoy sweets (such as sugar) more easily than they could. Gum provides a quick and easy source of calories, especially for people who do not chew food very long or care to chew it thoroughly. Since most of the world lives in countries that have banned the sale of sugary beverages, Americans are particularly drawn to gum as a source of sugar-free calories. Gum manufacturers have also capitalized on Americans’ obsession with youth. Toothpastes, mouth rinse, breath strips, and mints often contain active substances that mask the tastes of others to make the giver look young. Modern science has also found other uses for chewing gum. A University of Sydney study found that when dogs chew gum long enough, it actually reduces their rate of breathing and heart rate, and helps them sleep more comfortably. In the past, dogs would howl in pain as the bone did not permit enough chewing, but chewing gum reduces these discomforts. While chewing gum is often considered classless, some historians believe that early civilizations developed political organizations in the past to control populations. Ancient Romans believed that the scent of chewing gum"," Chewing gum was once widely believed to be healthier than other forms of candy such as fruit gums. However, gum today is still full of sugar and that can cause cavities. The chewing gum industry has grown with a fast turnover of new companies. These companies look for the latest marketing trends and the public has even invented a new term for the chewable sweetener, ""syrup"". 

There are at least twelve million sticks of gum chewed in the US every day. The habit was popularized by the Elvis Presley movie 'G.I. Blues' where the main character chews gum during car chases. Gum companies spent millions of dollars trying to promote their product to kids and celebrities. Gum has not been classified as a food because it does not comply with the FDA standards of good manufacturing practices (GMP). A stick of gum has nearly ten calories so it is not a healthy snack. American teenagers are overweight and have more than twice as many dental cavities than American kids ten years ago. It would not be surprising if gum is responsible for many of those cavities. American parents have started to ban their children from chewing gum and the American Chewing Gum Association reported a drop in sales after the ban and the FDA recently filed a complaint. The association wants to ban children from owning gum in order to sell advertising space to adult brands. American children also tend to be exposed to unhealthy advertising of snack foods and soft drinks which promote fast food and sugary drinks"
" “What the hell am I going to do with my life?” he kept thinking. And then, at lunchtime, he read a book. And then he read another book and then another and then he realized, “You know what, that’s actually pretty easy. You can do this.” And then, one day, he woke up and he was a horse whisperer. And then he fell in love. And then he published a book. “I had a brilliant idea for my screenplay, but… I just didn’t know how to make it work.” It turned out to be a good idea. Nicholas Evans’ first screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. “But more importantly, I made the horses on the set of my movie love each other, because they finally trusted one another. After years of having to sit in one place for weeks on end, they trusted one another enough to nuzzle and nuzzle and nuzzle.” And then, in his spare time, he helped hundreds of horses and dogs that fell through the cracks find their way to the right person. Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer and aspiring director, here is your story. It all started with the book. Nicholas Evans was a journalist. And one day, he was in a bookstore looking at a book and thought, “My god, this could be really good.” And then, he went back the next day and bought the book. And went back the day after that. And read"," The recession had hit Britain, and his first original television screenplay was a flop. He was unemployed, and had also had to lay off his friends, including actors and actresses. Nicholas Evans, however, had faith that things would turn around. The worst was behind him, and soon his fate would change, and so it did. The Horse Whisperer was a New York Times bestseller. A year later, The Horse Whisperer became a major motion picture starring Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey. Nicholas Evans was so inspired by the success of his screenplay that he dedicated his first novel The Horse Whisperer even before it was published. ""We're going to make this horse what he was meant to be"", says the book's author. ""We're going to make this horse the best horse that ever lived."" It would be 10 years before Nicholas Evans even published the novel. He began to receive letters from around the world from people who believed in the story, and his life began to change. It would later turn out that this story of belief, and of one man's triumph against all odds, was just as true as the story of the movie. The real Nicholas Evans is still unemployed, and has also lost friends in the recession, and yet this is not what stops him. He knows that he can write another book, and another, and one day the right story, the right character, or even just the promise of a"," His first published novel, the best-selling The Horse Whisperer, had been on the shelves for months, but the experience of learning to tell a story, and how that story was received by readers was something that had long since slipped through his fingers. At the time, it felt like something was holding me back. It was my own story, my ideas, my vision, but there was another, more powerful voice in my head, whispering in the back of my ear, and the only way to silence it was to get the words out there and see what happened. In my early career I wrote a lot of TV and film scripts. I was good at it, but I had no idea how to write for readers, so I kept going with the TV scripts. I enjoyed the creative freedom of working only with other people's money and it was exciting to think I could be the next huge TV star. It didn't help that the money was good. My script for the TV series The Ratcatcher, based on the books by Alan Glynn, was bought for a major series by a well-known production company. But the production company decided to drop the series in the summer before it was even written and I was left holding the bag, with more money than I had ever earned before, but no idea how to spend it or where it could even be spent.

It contained nothing to do with the classical tale of legal drama from Dickens... the producer insisted he find a new plot. One day he came across a book. The Horse Whisperer by a local author who lived down the road. The author claimed to have transformed the life of a mysterious horse whisperer who helped horses in a small town in Idaho. The producer wanted to meet the man; he took the book home and began to read. He was soon captivated by the story of the mysterious horse whisperer, who was said to have changed a local horse’s life. He was intrigued and asked his wife to buy a copy for the children. Within a few weeks, the man was contacted by the BBC, and his program was commissioned. By late summer the BBC series was in production. Suddenly, the horse whisperer made his first appearance on prime-time television and the author became a household name. Nicholas Evans screenwriter producer was soon being offered book deals. He had never written a book, but this one had sold millions of copies. And then the bombshell. By the summer of 1998, after two years of hard work, the horse whisperer, published in 1997, had finally appeared on the bestseller lists in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand and was even a short-list contender for the Booker prize in the UK. And it"," The horse whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans it has earned his author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph.

Even before publication, he says, ""the response was overwhelming."" The Horse Whisperer was the number one new release on both sides of the Atlantic in 2004. It was released in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2003. The New York Times called it ""a rare and delightful combination of storytelling, storytelling technique and social significance"". Evans was hailed as ""the next Hemingway"".

The Horse Whisperer was the highest-earning British-Somalian-American book in history when it was published. In the United States, it is the sixth-highest-earning book of 2004.

I started hearing whispers when I moved to Nebraska from London.  There was a big horse-breeding community there. But it wasn't that community that interested me.  I wanted to be the one who could make them all better and find their dream horse and bring it home.  It's no accident that the central character's name is Camel.  There was a Camel in Nebraska.  In the 1980s, it was the number one brand in the US. 

When I arrived in Nebraska I started seeing the horse-breeding community.  One day I was approached by a man who asked me about them."," His first novel the Horse Whisperer had barely made any impact at all. ""It was the first of the pile of unedited manuscripts lying on my desk. The last thing I needed was a film version, my reputation and sanity were on the line."" 

The Horse Whisperer was released in the UK and the US in June 2003. To date, it is now one of the best-selling books on Amazon. But for Nicholas Evans, the success came too late. He says he became aware of the book's sudden success when the sales figures arrived after Christmas. 

In the end, all the Horse Whisperer sold were millions of copies. Nicholas Evans says this was not a surprise, because he wrote the book to try out a new formula that had worked well for him in his other books. The formula was the use of a character who was just an observer, and whose sole job was to describe what was happening to other characters. 

Nicholas Evans says the success of the book has actually done him an injustice. The Horse Whisperer is a story about human connection, and about the power of horses to heal and healers to connect with horses. It is not a great film, or a great book. But in its way, it is every bit as good as the hundreds of other books about horses and horsebreeders that are not even considered by most people to be classics.

" Spurred on by the thought of his beloved country at war in France, Tamburlaine seizes the chance to wreak havoc and restore righteousness to his native East. At the Battle of Constantinople he is victorious. At the Siege of Antioch he slays the Crusader knights. At the Field of Blood he dispatches the Turk and his allies. But there is still the final battle against the Persian Emperor, where he is unhorsed and taken prisoner. In his cell he ponders his end and is visited by the Old Man of the East, the mythic figure who first inspired him. Hands, an alumnus of San Diego’s Old Globe Theatre, does a wonderful job of embodying the ancient Arabic mystic and the young warrior in the throes of heroism. In the grand final act he and his captors, the Christians and Crusaders, are locked in combat amid a riot of colour and costume (including spangles and tassels for the Persian). At last, after decades of preparation, Tamburlaine is free to unleash his fury on the infidels.

THEATRE CHARLES SPENCER – Terry Hands

  

The Old Man of the East enters, dressed in a turban and flowing robes, his beard painted bright red. He beckons the Persian to him, entreats him to return to his true form and asks that Tamburlaine be released"," Directed with zest and skill by Laura Wade, this production features a fine cast led by Peter Evans as Tamburlaine the Great and David Troughton as his antagonist, the Persian general Cambises.

It is a play that continues to engage and fascinate because of its sheer energy, variety of language and the performers’ virtuosity. Set in Asia and the Middle East, it is full of action, battle, chases, violence, sex and the richness of its culture is reflected in the language. The story begins in Medina in North Africa where Tamburlaine becomes involved in a local dispute with the Caliph’s uncle. It follows his travels around the world to Persia, where he kills the emperor’s guard at his reception, battles in the marshes of Lapland, and is eventually arrested for his many offences. It is a joy to watch this extraordinary cast pull off a number of feats that require them to be physically as well as vocally and emotionally engaged. Tamburlaine the Great is a true epic hero – a man of action and passion, a ruthless killer, a lustful womaniser and a master of diplomacy – who does what is needed to win a war and advance his own agenda. He is a fierce opponent of oppression and intolerance.

  The performance features some of the finest and most athletic actors working today, including Peter Evans, David Troughton, David Thwaites and Laura Wade. It","

A: “What makes the production exciting?”

THEO: “If you’ve seen any recent London-based musicals, you’ll know that the action rarely starts or ends on stage. The chorus will sing an aria, for example, before we see the cast appearing on the stage and then they’ll run off again before the first chord of another song has been sung. This creates an atmosphere of constant activity. Theatres have a habit of going late into the night and this creates the sense that you’re going to see a lot of the cast of Aeschylean metics (comics) at any one time. Terry has employed that to good effect. His design is very clever with lots of projections and lighting effects. It looks impressive and exciting. I wouldn’t say it gets exhausting but it certainly doesn’t leave you feeling relaxed. And the music, for me, is the most exciting part of the production. We’ve got a very impressive cast, including some very well-known stars, doing a fantastic job. But none of that will matter if the plot and language don’t hold your interest. And they do, particularly when the final chorus comes on – there’s pandemonium as they realise that Marlowe’s play was never actually meant to finish after ten acts. The final couplet is then sung with gusto in a style that is appropriate for a celebration, and even more so"," The story opens with the gods discussing their decision to bestow immortality on one man. The man of renown turns out to be a humble English lawyer: a man called Tamburlaine. After the gods bestow their blessings on Tamburlaine the warrior leads a glorious, triumphant life in Baghdad, where he continues to crush his enemies and defy the Sultan. The sultan, fearful of Tamburlaine’s ambition, arranges for his ex-wives to try and kill him. Tamburlaine foils the plot and wreaks havoc on the sultan’s court. When a chance encounter with the Roman general, Aeneas, leads to a Roman invasion, Tamburlaine rides to the rescue with his army, while Marlowe, in the second scene, makes a timely return to the court to report on Tamburlaine’s exploits. Hands’s production is relentless and leaves no character untouched. Tamburlaine’s wives are reduced to pathetic, whining wretches and his children to frightened infants. The cast are superb. Patrick Stewart, who plays Aeneas, is particularly striking, while Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding as Tamburlaine. Cumberbatch’s Tamburlaine has a glorious physique and a martial swagger that makes him a joy to watch. Hand’s production uses the best of lighting and make-up technology to create an atmosphere of blood, smoke"," 

SPENCER’S CHARLES TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT 
The road to Damascus was paved with good men.
That is what the preacher keeps saying.
It certainly has been a long and painful road
from the dark dungeons of Constantinople
to the golden streets of Antioch.
But TamBurr’s journey has not been without profit.

The king of Persia’s army is camped in Antioch
ready to take up their summer siege.
TamBurr is ready too.
He has gathered to his side a legion of
Christian slaves,
who are waiting on the other side of the
Bridge of Arrived in Acre, just beyond the
walls.

On that bridge the armies are met,
TamBurr and the Persians,
and on that bridge,
a tragedy and a legend are born. 

TamBurr and his army have fought valiantly
to wrest this kingdom from the grip of the
Turk.
But now Persia has a new ally,
a war god come to drive the Muslims back
into the darkest corner of the earth.
The god is Christ.

TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT tells the story of
one man’s journey from faithless heathen
to virtuous Christian warrior and is a saga
of good against evil, of glory to come
"," 
Spencer A. Tamburlaine the Great is a relentless hero and a pitiless foe but he is also a born leader, a superb orator, and an unstinting lover of life. His many victories prove his right to lead, his enemies are vanquished, and so he vows to take his battle to all comers. 
But he and his army also set sail for home only to find the shores of Europe under siege from raiders from the East, who, by turns, are their friends or foes. The threat of invasion draws the City of London into the battle in a final confrontation that makes for thrilling combat.
The story is compressed but, for all the running, it contains many of the elements that make the epic great: the richness of Tamburlaine’s love life; the humour of Tamburlaine’s court jester and of the Sultan’s son, Pulcheri; the ferocity of battle and of Tamburlaine’s enemies, particularly the Persian eunuch, Scilence.
But Hands’ staging delivers much more than action: it is a vivid evocation of Tamburlaine’s world and it also celebrates the city and its people. The action takes place in the open air and the battle scenes are spectacular, if a little static, amid a richly scenic landscape. This production is worth a visit for these reasons alone.
It is also"," From start to finish the action moves quickly and convincingly, and it is the combination of briskness and power that makes this Marlowe’s play of enduring popularity. The language is lively and intense, full of energy and passion. The actors take the language and the text at face value. And the staging has the hallmarks of a Hands production: the stage is always in view, the lighting is good and the design supports the action. But much also depends on the music and the sound, which have created a memorable night in every way. The music is joyful and exciting, with solos, ensemble numbers and period flavour. The sound design supports the action, making it seem to come to life. It is the perfect combination of words and actions that makes this a highly accessible version of the play that will engage any audience.

" But the best aspect of Deepcore is the way Cameron brings to life a world that feels both claustrophobic and vast. The sub has its own gravity; only the most minimalist design choices could minimize its size. Deepcore feels small, even as its dimensions swell to a whopping 22 miles by 6.5 miles by 5 miles; it could fit inside a city block in Houston or, for that matter, inside a single football field in Los Angeles. Deepcore is actually a single shaft, like a well with one end sealed. It’s 4 feet down and 100 feet across. That’s how deep oil drilling in the mid-20th century was accomplished. Deepcore contains six miles of steel cable, more than the height of sixstacked buildings. The drillers needed to make sure they didn’t lose track of the cable with too many bodies crowding around the sub’s open hatch. There were many cables, but the sub only had room for seven. Deepcore contains a lot of cables, a lot of equipment, and no place to hide. The men are trapped together, isolated from their families, and cut off from the outside world. They become emotionally invested in their mission and, some of them, envious of those who get to come up for air. They lose track of time and space, watching a clock but not knowing how much time has passed. The most interesting men are the ones who have the least confidence, the ones","

Bud and his mates are like those sweaty, wisecracking oil workers in 'Jaws' or that steadfast group of navy men in 'The Hunt For Red October.' All of them have been through a lot in their careers, and they keep getting into dangerous situations that put their lives in danger in films starring such actors as Gary Cooper, Robert Mitchum and Gary Owens, and in films directed by Howard Hawks. In fact, Bud and his crew, the best of whom are played by veteran character actors like Eddie Bracken, Alan Hale, Jr and Roy 'Rocky' Williams, are so similar to the likes of John Wayne or Humphrey Bogart that it's hard to tell them apart.

And they all have their moments of self-deprecation, and their banter is just as sharp and as witty as it is in a movie like 'Only Angels Get Away.' Bud makes a joke about how he'd love to be a fly on the wall in a boardroom when a top brass decision affects the men he's worked with his whole life, and his comment brings back memories of similar lines from Howard Hawks films. But he's also willing to go to any lengths for his men, and he'll sacrifice himself for them, even if it means risking his own life.

Bud is the star of the film, and he's fun to watch in his shorts, a shirtless kind of hunk, and he's all"," Hawks and his brother are regarded as the most inventive and original producers working in Hollywood in the second half of the 20th century. This is as true of the movies they made as it is of their careers. Hawks directed a dozen features and many television episodes, none of them anything near great. He has been called one of the greatest and funniest directors working today.


Bud's banter is a sharp counterpoint to James Cameron's histrionic direction. It's clear that the crew enjoys their work; their camaraderie is a critical component to their success. Even when faced with impossible odds, they remain unfazed, and their resolute approach ultimately saves the day.


Bud, played by Christopher Plummer, is a foreman on a TV news show who is often forced to host. This leads him to discover that he has an affinity for media production; he isn't particularly interested in the news or entertainment, but he likes doing the TV show. He is paired with a young technician named Rich (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a romantic interest who often clashes with him. But when they team up to resolve a high-profile breaking news situation, they quickly form an instant rapport. They are both scrappy and resourceful, and they complement each other well; they complement the crew as a whole. Bud provides an energetic, positive dynamic that motivates and inspires the others.


This is a terrific film and a great introduction to"," The men and their equipment represent all that is good about America: big and rugged, with a sense of humor and swagger, and none of the guilt that can overtake smaller, softer nations. 

Bud (Steve Martin) and his mates are an oil rig crew who pride themselves on their no-nonsense attitude, their competence and a willingness to get their hands dirty in hazardous conditions. When the crew's drilling rig is damaged and they are stranded in the freezing waters of the North Sea, they quickly learn that, beneath their tough exterior, these are not ordinary men. Their self-doubt and insecurities surface, and the tension mounts until the real danger of their situation emerges. 

As the pressure builds, Bud finds he is forced to choose between loyalty to his men and his country, and his own personal desires and sense of the humane. The choices he faces are ones that most of us face at work, in our relationships and in the everyday decisions that define our lives. 

Bud and his men offer a potent example of what it means to be American in the post-9/11 world: to put oneself in another's shoes, to look beyond one's own problems, and to put duty before self. This film reminds us of the values that bound our country together, even as it also explores how we compromise these ideals at times for our own benefit. 

Bud and his men offer a potent example of what it means to be American in"," This is a rare instance of one of cinema’s greats admitting he has little knowledge of the genre of his creation. In another throwback to the genre of screwball comedy the men try to persuade the boss to let them use a submersible to explore the ocean depths but are rebuffed. Meanwhile tensions rise at home as the wife is going through a difficult period. The plot is thin and derivative and the cinematography is dated but James’s gentle pace and eye for detail elevate these modest set-piece scenes into memorable drama. Despite its dated look and a handful of cliches the cast do great work and the best are the ensemble performances. The supporting characters have the most to do which is partly because director Cameron can go off script and make use of an expansive ocean. James also captures the loneliness and ambition that drive the men. The most impressive is Bud, who despite being 50 pounds overweight is wiry and resilient. James captures the weariness, sloppiness and ambition that make these oil riggers some of the hardest workers in the world. James also directs with skill as the film develops and reveals more back story to his characters. There are a few weak moments, notably the third act bathos of the sub’s computerised escape route, but the film is a joy to watch. Recommended.   Titanic director James Cameron’s epic saga of greed and hubris is back in theaters to a rapturous reception. But even as the largest"," They are not always heroes The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In movies directed by Howard Hawks. They are not always heroes, and the way they tackle their most perilous tasks often fails to match the exhilaration of the central chase. Yet their bravery, ingenuity and willingness to sacrifice comfort and their own safety for a higher cause make them compelling and worthy champions in a vital and complicated world. 

Nick James

"," The best quote from the film is probably when a drunk-sodden sailor exclaims that he never saw such big boats before, at which Bud, whose rig is dwarfed by the titanic proportions, responds that he's been working on the ship for six months. 

# Adapted from the CEFR prompt


Nick James reviewed the recent release of A Abyss Long before Titanic director James Cameron made this sweaty claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water. 

Bud, an unrepentant, jovial oil rigger, and his fellow menacing men provide the backbone of the plot: a mission to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded in an ocean trench hundreds of feet deep. Their mission is complicated by the fact that the submarine is in perilously low condition. Despite the obstacles, the men have high confidence in their ability to succeed and soon find themselves struggling to free the trapped submarine. 

When things start going wrong, with the submarine damaged and on the point of striking bottom, Bud and his team put their shoulders to the wheel and stick to their guns - it's going to be okay. 

When Bud is injured in a daring rescue attempt, he finds himself a liability to the mission and the men lose trust in him. But he never gives up and, in the end, the submarine is successfully freed and the mission is a success.

The Times today is no more. Today’s New York Times Company website is actually a replica of the print edition, but one can look to the future if one so desires. The NYT Group also owns The Atlantic, Business of Fashion and a handful of niche sites. They have recently launched an iProduct page, but the website still mimics the print version in all aspects.

That is until the NYT’s new CEOMark Thompsonannounces that the newspaper’s print edition will be discontinued, effective Saturday, December 9th.

The end of the printed newspaper will come as a shock to many Americans. According to Thompson, the paper’s decline can be linked to the rise of digital media, as well as declines in advertising revenues and print consumer interest.

“The decline of the printed newspaper can be linked to a variety of factors,” he says. “The rise of digital media has made it difficult to deliver high-quality content and attractive advertising on a daily basis in a printed product. Declines in advertising and consumer interest have led to a decline in the economic viability of the industry.” 

The announcement that the print version will stop in two weeks shocked many NYT employees. Thompson says the newspaper has tried to prepare its employees for the end of print over the past year, but it wasn’t until he read an essay in a Times Books anthology that he realized the scope of the situation. 

“A couple of weeks"," I’d suggest that maybe there needs to be a little more of a transition from paper to digital and it begins with a simple statement of intent.

Create a transition statement for paper to digital stating that ‘the end of print may take some time’:

The end of print may take some time
However, we will never truly transition until all newspapers are converted to online versions

Next, create the supporting statements:

Until all newspapers are converted to online versions
There will always be a need to produce and distribute newspapers
Newspapers have a rich heritage of local journalism, reporting and analysis

Create a transition for paper to digital statement:

The end of print may take some time
However, we will never truly transition until all newspapers are converted to online versions

Until all newspapers are converted to online versions
There will always be a need to produce and distribute newspapers

Newspapers have a rich heritage of local journalism, reporting and analysis

Next, expand on the idea that ‘there needs to be a little more of a transition from paper to digital’ by explaining why:

The concept of transitioning is something new to this digital age
Newspapers have a rich history of local journalism that is now slowly lost with the reduction of physical paper copies
This loss to quality local journalism is a matter of great concern

Finally, consider what will need to be transitioned from print to online in order to preserve the"," The ‘transition’ is complete and we’re all in ‘it’ now I’m afraid. But we were worried about the loss of our daily rhythm, the breaking of the news cycle and the demise of community – I admit – but we were misguided. The ‘transition’ has been painless, rapid, cheap and more than worth the effort and money. Because, really – haven’t we had enough of the daily grind?

Peter Preston had an interesting take on the idea of transition.  It could be described as a hopeful view that has benefited his newspaper and probably many others as well. He states that people were worried about the loss of the newspaper because it was the first major transition from print to digital. Yet he goes on to say that the transition was painless, rapid, cheap and even more than worth the effort and money. He suggests that we needed to loosen our grip on the daily grind. What a refreshing viewpoint.  His words will certainly resonate with digital natives. He suggests that we need to embrace the future and not worry about what may go away.  It makes sense, really.  I certainly need to loosen my grip on the daily grind.  And yes, I’m going to try the new website and see if the new design is better suited for my needs.

I love this quote:

The world needs more like Peter Preston and less like me.

Thank you Peter Preston for your"," 

Write a passage that includes the following text: 

“Peter Preston Transition” is a pleasant word and a calming concept. 

Change may frighten some and challenge others. 

But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future.

Unless that is it is newspapers’ “transition” to the online world an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process. 

Indeed “transition” may not be a process at all. 

On the contrary, “transition” should be a word used with caution.


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is a commonly used scale for grade-level comparisons. Grade 2 learners can typically read a passage at a grade level of 7. Grade 9 learners can typically read a passage at a grade level of 10.


The Grade Level of 7 is considered very easy reading. Grade 9 is considered challenging reading.


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale was developed in 1998. The original scale had three categories: Easy reading (Grade level 7), Normal reading (Grade level 10-12) and Challenging reading (Grade level 16-18).


The Flesch-Kincaid readability scores are based on the average sentence length. A score of 100 is considered very easy reading. A score of 70-79 is considered average reading. And a score of 16 or less is considered challenging reading.


The Flesch-Kinc","  It’s a collapse and an abrupt change from one regime to another. It’s the demise of one medium to another with all its trappings (newspapers, phones, electricity, internet). But wait! What’s this? Just last week it seemed like an abrupt change could be just what newspapers were going to achieve: an abrupt change from the printed page to the web. Suddenly the internet was going to save newspapers.  And now? Now the news is that the abrupt change may never happen at all, that newspapers will now collapse in upon themselves, that the newspaper business is in crisis and that its demise has begun. 
The collapse of the newspaper business, the abrupt change and the onset of a crisis – these three elements appear in a graphic known as the Penguin curve. 
The Penguin curve was created by the London School of Economics’ Ben de Caudrelier and shows the fortunes of the daily newspapers over the last 90 years. The curve has a particular symmetry; for every period in which there is a decline in daily newspapers, there is a period during which newspapers have grown slightly. The curve has a number of important inflection points: the first, in 1920, was followed by another in the mid 1970s, another in the early 1990s and the most recent was the 2008 collapse of the ‘Pension Funds’ edition of The Daily Telegraph. The key to understanding the curve is that it does not show annual figures for newspapers; it uses"," I don’t mean just technology but the new environment which is more frenetic, faster, more competitive, where people expect instant answers. As for me it is a relief to see the back pages of the newspapers and to know that this end of print means, yes, an end. A sense of finality about what is a great help in allowing you to get on with your day. For one it means the thought is out of your mind of being unable to dispose of the newspapers and for the others – the end is in sight and now they can focus on what’s ahead which I am not going to spell out here, but you should read the book. 

It’s a classic example of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale with good word, sentence, and syllable count. The words per sentence and total sentence are both lower than 10, which are the thresholds for the Grade Level “6” (children who can understand what’s being read to them without difficulty) and “7” (children who can understand much of what’s read to them) reading levels. The Grade Level “7” allows “pleasant” as a good word and “calming” as a good concept. The sentence punctuation is consistent with a Grade Level “6” text.

  Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 6

  Total Words: 7.2

  Total Sentences: 14

  Total Syllables:"," It’s just some men running the press in jackboots, with the newspaper in tow. But the newspaper will still be there tomorrow to remind you that tomorrow never comes.

And the internet has more cats than a cat rescue. And frankly that’s enough of your newspapers and your internet transition!

The correct answer is: transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless that is it is newspapers’ transition to the online world an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process.

The passage mentions:
- the end of print, Peter Preston Transition;
- transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future;

And though he may appear more comfortable sharing his craft with friends than strangers, it is his deep interest in the details and intricacies of his work that draws Joanna Watt to him. 

What does Charles Hurst's personality reveal about him?


Charles Hurst: Joanna Watt meets him at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London.  She arrives at the arch and is greeted with a quick handshake and words: 'Well fire away then!'  Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak, is not immediately apparent. But over the course of three hours in this workshop, Joanna Watt discovers a man of hidden depths.  His ability to create something from the ground up, without reference points, is what makes his trade so satisfying"," But it does nothing to dampen my enthusiasm for my visit. Hurst has designed an entire wall mounted wardrobe for the staircase of my flat and has even carved the metal frame from which the wardrobe will hang. I am speechless, and the cabinet-maker is delighted. He seems genuinely happy to be making this piece of furniture which he has created to a client's exact specifications. I'm looking to buy one for my flat and so this conversation naturally follows. When I ask how long it will take he gives me a date which I later find is in the next quarter of an hour. I panic; this will surely go much faster than that! Yet once he has opened the chest of my wardrobe which he has positioned in the center of the room and begun unscrewing and reassembling the various wooden components he is happy to talk, and has many more stories to tell of how he got his start, the challenges he has faced, and the difficulties of finding work in a tough and depressed economic climate. This is no hurried man!

  1. Hurst likes to make furniture quickly because he is happy with what he has made but also likes to tell lots of stories about how he got to where he is today.

  2. Hurst looks like he is in a hurry, he has designed an entire wall mounted wardrobe for the staircase of a flat, and even carved the metal frame from which the wardrobe will hang.

  3. Hurst seems genuinely happy to"," Charles Hurst is clearly very passionate about his craft and starts to chat about his background, his apprenticeship and what inspired him to start his own business. This is the first of many fascinating conversations Joanna Watt has with Charles Hurst and he is clearly a man of many talents. Joanna is struck by his unusual accent and his unusual way of conversing. He asks a number of interesting questions, notably about the local neighbourhood and the area's political climate. Joanna is keen to know more about the man and his business, so she decides to walk around the workshop to get a better idea of what it is he does. She is struck by the precision of the designs, the attention to detail, and the incredible craftsmanship evident in each piece. The man is clearly a genius and Joanna is entranced, feeling certain this is something special. When Charles Hurst offers to take her around his shop she is tempted, intrigued by the beauty on display. She cannot believe her luck and in no time at all they have found a piece of furniture that has captured Joanna's heart. In the end, Joanna cannot resist buying a beautiful chair from Charles Hurst's workshop, a chair that will remind her of this adventure for years to come. The chair is perfect and the two have settled into an understanding of what the furniture business entails. Charles Hurst is delighted and Joanna is thrilled with her purchase. 

How did Joanna Watt come to"," It isn't long before it becomes apparent, he has a knack for putting a piece of wood to sleep as well as an understanding of a wooden frame and its capabilities. 'There is such a thing as too much support', I say and he laughs. We are talking about a dining table that was not straight and have some tea and homemade biscuits. In another corner, a young apprentice is fettling with an intricate chair. Charles hursts smile broadens and for a brief moment I think I have stepped into an episode of Masterchef or Ant & Dec. He is a craftsman and an artist and every board he lays his hands on he enhances. The workshop has been Charles Hurst's home for over 30 years and is an oasis of order. 

Charles Hurst: The Cabinet-Maker

"," But we soon find out that Hurst's brusqueness masks a desire to talk and an eagerness to share his life’s work. He has a long, colorful history story to share. In this inspiring talk Hurst traces his career from an impoverished urban youth living in a war-torn London, to the head of the largest furniture-making company in Asia. It wasn’t until several years into his career when Hurst noticed an anomaly. 'I went into a shop one day, and the prices of the pieces of furniture were half what they were in the shop across the street, and I said to myself “how am I doing this?”,'Hurst recalls. 'I went back the next week, and it was still the same, so I thought what’s going on? But then when I went into my company, I realized this was our normal business model.’ His company went on to dominate the global furniture market. 

Charles Hurst is one of the world’s most successful furniture-makers. His career started as an impoverished urban youth in a war-torn London, and went on to become the head of the largest furniture-making company in Asia. With his company's business model now a global model, Hurst noticed that prices were half in the shop one street away, and his company’s prices were still half what they should be. This simple observation led Hurst to discover an anomaly, and he went","  After a few moments I realise that there is a sense of self-deprecation here, he is aware of the artifice of being a craftsman, and his demeanour is a product of his upbringing. Hurst is the cabinet-maker to a rich aristocrat, which means a lot of travel and a lot of sitting around, so he naturally ends up taking on more menial tasks. I ask him if he ever makes beds: 'Nearly every night. I make the frame and upholstery.' A sense of pride is evident in his voice as he says this, as if it is a skill he is proud of.  And perhaps it is. His workshop is well organised and neat, the furniture is of the highest quality, and the finishing is immaculate. His workshop is not full of junk and he has a good eye for quality, which all goes to show that the skill of crafting a beautiful piece of furniture does not come without innate ability. Hurst's story, as told by Joanna Watt, is compelling.

Charles Hurst: Cabinet-Maker

  * The story takes the form of a first person narrative

  * Charles Hurst is the protagonist

  * His name is revealed later on in the text

  * He is from East London

  * He works as a cabinet-maker

  * Joanna Watt meets him after following him under an arch on the London Underground

  "," For this first encounter, Hurst has prepared a small coffee table covered in a thin coat of varnish. After I've introduced myself to his staff - an assistant for painting work and the woman who is to carry out the painting - Hurst leaves me to it.

At first glance, Hurst's workshop is as impeccable as his table. The varnish is spotlessly clean and a light dusting of powdered resin completes the effect. A quick inspection of the surface however does little to convince me of Hurst's haste. After all, I have waited to meet him for an hour and the carpentry is not yet finished. A closer inspection however reveals that Hurst has only just started the first leg of his project.

A small table, perhaps five feet long, is propped against one wall. The legs are in a pile on the ground and the table is still to take its shape from the raw wood. The table top is an uneven oval of seasoned pine, with the thicker part running down the middle and the thinner edges curving round into a bowl shape. A small mirror and box of nails are propped against the wall. Hurst's work is already beginning.

When he returns with the assistant, Hurst hands over the varnish. I am surprised that the carpenter himself is not performing the finishing touches, but the assistant does not disappoint. The varnish has a thin layer of resin which the two rub"
" The second is that Southwell is one of just two remaining medieval monasteries that used peat as a fuel for their boilers.

Using what you learned in the chapter about peat, answer the following:

Southwell was a Benedictine monastery that used peat as fuel for their boilers. It is the only medieval monastery to do so.


Charles Clover grew up in the peat bogs of North America. He lived to tell the tale:


When I first stepped onto Southwell’s property in 2016 I was worried about the unusual number of flies in the air—so many I was afraid they would take up residence in my clothes. This turned out to be an apt metaphor for the rest of my time here. Everything about Southwell is unusual. Its cathedral status is the first thing that comes to mind. Built in the 13th century on top of a pre-existing Anglo-Saxon monastery, it was Southwell’s status as a cathedral that originally drew the Benedictines to the site, and the monks carved their gods and kings into the stone walls of the chapter house, but today it is world-renowned for what it does not have: peat for heat. While other monasteries use peat as a fuel source because they had to in order to grow enough food for themselves and their monks, Southwell went for something better: natural gas.

Southwell was not the first Benedictine monastery"," On the site once occupied by the minster a team of experts have built a futuristic home, powered by the sun.


Charles Clover, the ‘solar survivor’, wanders inside Southwell Minster, Britain’s most environmentally friendly home and discovers it is not so ‘green’ after all. Rather it is filled with pagan figures of ‘green’ men, carved in the thirteenth century. The team that created the home have simply added a spiffy new roof and made the existing crypts available as underground living spaces. The result is a modern home which, despite its eco credentials, is not without its own quirks.

The solar home is actually a bit of a mess. The panels are visible through the windows and the kitchen area is a mess. But the view from the outside is worth the effort to explore.


Inside the home you will find a range of high-tech gadgets you could buy for home, the most notable being the ‘Mermaid’ shower, and a collection of oddities like a ‘solar oven’ and a ‘space elevator’. The idea is that solar power will allow you to get away with keeping many of these quirky items.

He watches a man scrubbing the floor and notices the lack of any effort at dusting.

And, finally, to top it all off, a very British solar system of electricity generating and light-bulb-warming devices; but, as you discover, not all are so green; and some have secrets. 

The story Charles Clover writes about is a really interesting and thought-provoking account of how different technologies interact with the environment and how they benefit the society as a whole. He also touches on important subjects such as sustainability, consumerism, and greed, which are all issues relevant to the 21st century.

The use of appropriate technologies and the appropriate balancing of needs and impacts are some of the key messages of the story. It is a wonderful example of effective narrative storytelling that will engage and inspire A2 learners.

A second is the country’s most sustainable home in one of the most desirable places to live: surrounded by beautiful countryside and a vibrant local economy. Sustainable Southwell is the brainchild of Sir Zac Goldsmith, a leading light in the National Health Service’s ‘Future of Health’ movement who, in 2014, received the highest honour for a civilian in Britain, the Victoria Cross. 

When Charles arrives, Sir Zac is surprised to discover he has taken up residency in the estate agent’s portfolio of properties which the estate agent hopes will go up for sale again after a seven year decline. He is less surprised to discover that the architect who designed the home and built it has also left. Sir Zac takes on the role of landlord and is immediately struck by how much care has been taken to ensure the home has not become a haven for rats and mice. He orders that the pest problem be addressed and the mice’s demise recorded in an appendix to the lease. He is also delighted to find a gardenia shrub, a non-native plant which has caused more problems for Sir Zac than it has solved, has been removed.

However when he discovers that Southwell has the most advanced solar panels in Europe Charles comes to the understanding that Southwell is not a City of Green People after all. Rather Southwell is more like a green-personed cathedral.

" In the United States millions of people receive acupuncture treatment for back, neck and joint pain. American doctors feel that the effectiveness of acupuncture is not yet proven in the scientific world. Their criticism is that acupuncture does not work. Some patients prefer to treat themselves without medication or other invasive forms of treatment. This has lead to many people looking for natural alternatives. Acupuncture has become a hot topic. In the media Acupuncturists are portrayed as exotic Eastern doctors treating Western patients with Eastern methods. Some companies are marketing Acupuncture items. These items include acupuncture needles that look like weapons. 

Recommendations from your advisor:

1. Read the passage and identify all the key terms.
2. Compare the two worlds in which Acupuncture is being used: Traditional Chinese medicine vs the West
3. Research the effectiveness of Acupuncture for pain relief in the US and China. 
4. Discuss the ethical, legal, and regulatory issues that Acupuncturists and companies are facing today.

Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine which uses needles to treat body pain. In the West, doctors have not confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating pain, although many people in the US choose to treat themselves with it. Acupuncturists are portrayed in the media as exotic doctors from the East using Western methods. Some companies are marketing acupuncture needles that look like weapons. Recommended reading to understand the"," Many believe acupuncture helps reduce pain because it works by sending tiny, thin needles into muscles and nerves to release endorphins and other chemicals that prevent cells in the brain from sending pain signals to the body. Despite the popularity of acupuncture there is still much skepticism in the medical community. Some doctors are very critical of its efficacy and some view it as superstition. Many believe that the needles and other methods involved in acupuncture are not well understood by doctors in the West and the process lacks a strong evidence base to support it’s use to reduce pain.

The key words to search are:

Acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine.

Read all of the websites linked in the text and then look at the websites of the organizations linked in the bibliography.  Do they all support Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medicine?  If not, why not?

Acupuncture has been practiced in China for over two thousand years.

In the West, doctors have had mixed feelings about the usefulness of acupuncture for pain.

While there is increasing evidence to support acupuncture's role in pain management, there is still much skepticism within the medical community.

Even though acupuncture has a long history, there is still a lack of understanding of the needles and other treatment methods involved within the West.

Acupuncture may help reduce pain because it works by sending tiny, thin needles into muscles and nerves to release endorphins and other chemicals that prevent cells in","  There are many studies to show that acupuncture is a safe and effective way to reduce the levels of pain in adults and children.  Acupuncturists in the West trained in ancient Chinese herbal medicine use thin needles to penetrate the skin and deliver low electrical currents to treat the body.

In this story it is suggested that the concept of Chinese medicine has made its way into the West.  It has gained popularity.  Many people suffering from pain in the West are turning to acupuncture.  It is also suggested that this will no longer be the only form of Chinese medicine as more doctors are being trained in the Chinese system of herbal medicine to provide treatments matching traditional Chinese medicine.


The story then suggests that the idea that Chinese medicine has had a strong presence in the West could be a myth.  The reason given is that although modern Chinese medicine has gained popularity it is still strongly rooted in the traditional Chinese medicine system that dates back two thousand years.  As with all legends there is truth in this myth but there is also a strong desire by many doctors in the West to provide a modern approach to treating pain that goes beyond what Western science has to offer.  Acupuncturists in the West with little knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine are using the ancient system to treat patients.


The end of the article then goes on to say that more Chinese doctors are entering the United States to treat Westerners for conditions they haven’t been treated for in China and there have"," Acupuncture works by placing tiny needles in the body at specific locations to help reduce pain and inflammation. This type of manual treatment has been around for very few Western generations so it has had a hard time establishing itself in the medical community. A friend of mine who works in the field says they have seen acupuncture as a trending topic in health but the truth is it is hard to gain traction when there are far cheaper options for treating pain. 

Acupuncture in the West
In the West, acupuncture has been embraced by many doctors who are seeing a growing need for less invasive treatments. Doctors in the U.S. treat 500 million dollars worth of acupuncture annually and many of their patients are turning to this manual treatment. The reason for this spike can be attributed to the lack of innovation in other treatments for pain. Many of the herbal medicines and stretches do not provide long lasting relief or address the root of the problem which is inflammation in the nervous system. 

In the past few years we have seen an increase in the development of electrical stimulation devices like the Sp6c device. This device uses tiny needles that are placed at precise locations on the body and deliver mild electrical stimulation. The idea is that pain can be treated with less needles which is a welcomed innovation that will likely allow acupuncture to survive the competition. 

The long term success of acupuncture in the US will be to remove the fear factor from pain treatment. Many doctors opt for surgery or prescription narcotics to provide short term"," Acupuncture works by inserting fine needles into specific points on the body that are connected to the area of pain. The pain is believed to be related to blockages in energy flow in the body which need to be broken.

Acupuncture is performed by a acupuncturist who has studied for several years in China. Although it is becoming more accepted in the medical community western doctors prefer not to use acupuncture because of the possibility of triggering pain. It is used in different ways. Many people report having lower back pain relief from acupuncture while others use it for headaches stress insomnia.


The prompt requires that you provide 1) a brief introduction to acupuncture, 2) a reference for how to approach a medical reference for your answer and 3) an answer with a conclusion that ties your answer to what is known about the role of acupuncture in treating pain.


Introduction:

Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine system that works by inserting fine needles at specific points on the body to break through blockages in energy flow, is being accepted by Western doctors for the treatment of pain.

In a 2016 journal article, Dr. Cathy O’Neil writes, “Acupuncture doesn’t really work for most people, but that’s not surprising because doctors reject its effectiveness. It should be used as an adjunct to better, traditional pain treatment, and not as a replacement.” Dr. O’Neil is a health writer and a co-","  Acupuncture works by inserting thin needles at precise points on your body to relieve pain this has been shown in several studies. However doctors in the West would not accept acupuncture until the 1990s when a sceptical scientific community agreed to treat patients.   

Acupuncture has been tested in numerous clinical studies and was shown to be effective in treating acute low back pain, migraines and other conditions. More recently studies in cancer pain and chronic low back pain have shown positive results. 

Acupuncture is not a new discovery however a sceptical scientific community made it less popular. 

Acupuncture is not a new discovery, in fact it is two thousand years old. Traditional Chinese Medicine or TCM includes herbalism, massage, diet, and exercise and includes acupuncture to treat various conditions.   

Acupuncture works by inserting thin needles at precise points on the body to relieve pain. The idea is that these specific points have properties that the body uses to heal itself.  In fact, the theory goes, the body perceives the pain at the point where the needle enters the tissue. Since the body perceives the pain there, the body releases endorphins to help alleviate the pain.  These studies show positive results but doctors in the West did not accept acupuncture until the 1990s when a sceptical scientific community agreed to treat patients.  

While scientists questioned the value of acupuncture, clinicians started to see results.  It was approved for treatment"," Modern Western physicians use acupuncture for treating conditions such as arthritis and back pain but the ancient Chinese have also been experimenting with acupuncture to treat fever and other illnesses. Modern research shows acupuncture may even have anti-inflammatory effects on the body. The theory is that when a needle is inserted into specific parts of the body called points in the body the body’s ‘fifth sense’ detects and treats illness in the body by triggering an inflammation response. However a small controlled study of fevers that used real acupuncture needles in patients and found no significant difference in treatment compared to a control group. 

Acupuncture has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for 2,000 years but today’s Western medical community only started to research its potential in the 19th and 20th centuries.  More than 90,000 people have been studied and over half have reported at least a 50% improvement in pain and discomfort. A common treatment area for people seeking pain relief through acupuncture is the head and neck region. This is because it’s a region that is close to the brain so the ‘five senses’ are more active in the brain and therefore pain can be more intense. 

Studies of adults and infants have shown statistically significant relief for both pain and inflammation. However the question remains whether the benefit for pain relief is from the needle insertion or a physiological effect triggered through the point being stimulated.  A recent study that directly compared the two different types of needle stimulation found that the manual stimulation of the needle has"

Rodney looked at the pictures. ""So this is what rich looks like,"" he said.


""Look at Clay's clothes!"" Bambi exclaimed. ""They look brand new!""


The article then went on to describe how Rodney had bought Clay out of prison and that now they were a team. They owned a Porsche, a boat, and a couple of luxury homes. The article ended by wondering if Clay could do the same for a less fortunate dog.


Clay studied the article. He was still struggling with the fact that Rodney had actually paid him to give up his dog. Rodney must really want him to own a Porsche and a boat, he thought. He folded the newspaper and set it aside. His phone began to vibrate with an incoming message. It was from the attorney.

But how did Clay Carter get from not looking like he fit in the world of high-powered politics to being a successful senator? He started off as a poor neighborhood kid who never looked down on anyone and worked his way up the political food chain by being kind and gentle.  Over the course of a few short years, Clay Carter went from not knowing who his friends were to being invited to exclusive dinners with important political figures and he's now a leading Republican candidate for the United States Senate in Florida.

The assistant stated that Clay “is the perfect example of what a hard working, self-made man can achieve.”

As a teacher, I can tell you my blood starts to boil when I read this passage to my students. I have seen students who have a difficult time reading this passage because it is “too complex” and lacks simple sentences. So how does this passage measure up to this standard? In the “grade level” scale Flesch-Kincaid, the passage is rated at Level 8 (high complexity), so even though it contains simple sentences, there is too much “compound-complexity.” Clay Carter is a lawyer in the November issue of the magazine, and his assistant states, “He is the perfect example of what a hard working, self-made man can achieve.” The complexity of the passage causes many of the key words to be unreadable to Grade 2 readers, which makes the passage difficult for students to understand and increases their frustration when they don’t fully understand what the author is trying to say.

In the last photograph, Rodney can be seen sitting at the table, along with other homeless people, all dressed in their winter wear, eating a Thanksgiving dinner of turkey, cornbread, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberries and stuffing. 

The caption underneath the photo reads, “Two worlds collide.” While Clay is enjoying Thanksgiving dinner with his friends, Rodney is shivering in the cold, homeless shelter. 

What is the story of these two worlds colliding? 

This is an interesting story of two worlds colliding. The first world Clay lives in is the very expensive and luxurious one. He wears Armani suits and drives Porsches. He has friends, and they all sit around the table together and share the same meal. 

In contrast, the second world is the very poor and homeless shelter, where Rodney lives. Rodney is wearing worn out sweatpants and a tattered coat. He is not dressed up like a holiday or Thanksgiving dinner would be. He is sharing the same dinner that he and the others brought, but now he is shivering with cold.

Enter Mr Jones, a slightly scruffy and slightly portly man in his late 30’s. He’s very much into the idea of historical romance novels and so is Isabel. This makes him a good candidate but he also has a number of other shortcomings: He doesn’t want children, he drinks, he smokes and he actually looks rather good in jeans. He has those knobbly knees to prove it! It would take more than those knees to stop this marriage being broken up but it would certainly make it a battle to keep it together. 
There’s just one catch, Mr Jones is actually a bit of a double agent for the forces of good. He knows how to build a bomb, just ask his friends in the underground resistance. He’s also a bit of a ladies man. He’s been unfaithful to several women and wants to try out his skills on Isabel. 
Isabel must decide if she is going to let a man with so many faults get a foot in the door of her ideal man. The fact she is a romantic at heart and will always long to be on a white steed with a blasting horn means it’s going to be more than a bit hard to say no to a certain knight in shining armour. But does she want it all? A happily ever after? Or is she content to settle for a knight in rusting armour who might not be quite so bad after all"," 

Isabel (Isabelle as she prefers to be known) has lived a solitary life for most of her life. She has devoted her energies to her art and never had to worry about offending anybody. She believes that people are generally good at heart and one shouldn't judge people based on the clothes they wear or the job they do. When she met an air hostess on an airport shuttle, she was amazed at how well the young woman was dressed and hoped for a happy ending. But when he asked Isabel to pose nude in his painting she was shocked. 'I look rather good in jeans. So I rarely wear them. I don't want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.’  

Her friend Mina agrees. ‘You're far from the wrong sort of person. Your knees are very knobbly but they're not so bad that you couldn't pose for a nude painting.’ And that does exactly what it says on the tin. Isabel poses nude for the painting of her air hostess suitor and is astonished to learn that the man is not only handsome but also quite attractive. 
Isabel doesn't realise that her knee problem is the reason he was not interested in her before. She is now delighted with her happy ending. 

What Isabel does realise is that her friend Mina has been scheming all along to help her out of her predicament. So they go to Mina's room where they find a photo"," She has just returned from a trip to Greece where she visited the island of Tinos. Tinos is famed for the perfect male figures on its statues.

Isabel has been recommended a sculptor, a man called Peter, who has impressive classical Greek features. The recommendation is made by her friend Alex, a writer, in an effort to encourage her. At first, Isabel is reluctant as she fears she’ll never meet the right man who has classical Greek features.

One Saturday morning she walks into an art museum and spots a well proportioned classical statue and recognises it as Peter. This is the beginning of a strange journey that will change her life as she embarks on a search for Greek gods and goddesses.

During her travels she discovers there’s more to Greece than classical Greek features and is astounded by the beauty of the natural world, the magic of fairy chimneys and the passion of modern Athens. And she rediscovers the island of Tinos, which seems to be the epicentre of everything wonderful about Greece.


She buys a house and begins to appreciate the ancient mythology which underlies modern Greece. She discovers the island has a unique set of attributes that are absent from the mainland. These include a distinct language, dress sense, way of walking, way of viewing the world and ways of thinking.

Isabel is surprised to find that the islanders are quite likeable and the Greek mythology makes her think more creatively"," She attends a wedding where she meets Daniel, an actor who takes an immediate shine to her. Her friend Sally, a journalist, has a brother who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, and Daniel encourages him to get involved with the wedding. The marriage fails and the heroine becomes a tragic figure, but she is full of surprising and endearing characteristics. There are plenty of cultural allusions to allow the reader to fully understand the setting, but there is no heavy-handedness.

Recommended texts:

•   P. G. Wodehouse, Jeeves (adaptation)

•   Robin Cook, A Room with a View (adaptation)

  * The novel has a zany tone, but never lets the pace of the story drop. It reads easily for Grade 2, and will appeal to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted romance.

  * The first part of the novel is enjoyable, but becomes rather formulaic towards the end. This is probably because it is a modern adaptation of a highly regarded Wodehouse novel, and as such the story becomes more or less redundant.

  * The heroine’s knobbly knees, although a minor plot point, are heavily dwelt upon in a manner that is rather trite and clichéd. There is also a rather implausible explanation for why the character has such knees, which makes little sense (she has been running all her life) and feels like the","

She travels to Spain for a teaching exchange and meets a charismatic lecturer. He tells her he’s looking for a student, a ‘margarita’ to start his collection. The lecturer has the requisite jet-black hair, olive complexion and Spanish accent. The last thing Isabel expects when they meet is for him to fail to mention he has a wife and 3 teenage sons.

As the novel unfolds you witness a hilarious romp through the complexities of relationships, betrayal and loss. The supporting cast is hilarious: a Spanish ‘guide’ whose accent gives nothing away, the lovely but mysterious Professor and the hilarious ‘guide’ to Barcelona. Isabel’s love life thrives; the plot has her tackling the challenges of the modern world with panache and humour.

The author, Philippa Gregory, has written another winner. She paints vividly the vibrant characters, from the quirky lecturer to the marginalised wife, and makes them believable and relatable. Isabel, her friends, the Spanish guide and the Professor all provide a light-hearted yet thoughtful and witty commentary on modern love and life.

There’s a whiff of Monty Python about this novel. There is the character of ‘Professor’, with his quips and catch phrases, which would make a wonderful sketch for the Flying Circus. The Spanish guide is reminiscent of the Spanish Inquisition; Isabel and her friends, the ‘margarita"," She receives a visit from a mysterious man in a well-tailored suit who suggests he can help. He reveals he can perform a genetic re-write of her genes which will enhance her looks, enabling her to start dating confidently without fear of rejection. 

B. 'I'd have to look at the contract again but I think it might be a problem if my genes were re-written,' Isabel declares with trepidation. 'I'd never be able to meet anyone.' 'Not true. Your genes need enhancement, after all. Why wouldn't you be able to meet someone?' the man asks. 'Because I look like I've just stepped out of a 1960s pop group photo shoot.’ 
With that, he hands her a sheaf of papers and departs. Isabel peers at the pages and they turn to green ink. She looks at herself in the bathroom mirror and is horrified to see that her face has aged significantly: she is now 35, not 31. She runs back into the living room and screams, 'Who did this? Who did this to me?' 
The novel then takes a turn for the bizarre as Isabel starts going by the name of the man in the suit: Mr Fitzwilliam. 
C. 'Mr Fitzwilliam?’ she repeats in disbelief. ‘That man changed my face into something that I don’t recognise. My name, my family’s name, my own identity!’ ‘What do"," After a chance meeting with a neighbour who appears to have the goods, she leaves her job, pack her bags, and embarks upon a year-long world tour in search of Mr Right. A fun romp if you enjoy a good adventure but the plot lacks sufficient sub-plots, the characters suffer from too many archetypes and the ending lacks surprise. 

B. ‘The jeans have been a talking point since our first meeting. I have tried to ignore the jibes and jokes about my ‘knobbly knees’ but frankly I have given up. My knees are fine, my eyes are my only weak point. ‘ My ears pricked up at this point. 

C. ‘You could say my knobbly knees are my biggest asset. I’d be lost without them.’ And with that the narrator took the bait, unaware of the consequences for her knees. 

D. ‘My knees are knobbly, just like my eyes and my voice, and I bet my knobbly knees have turned you off.’ With this one, Isabel’s favourite line, the narrator had her victory lap. 

E. ‘So, you’re not wearing jeans because of your knobbly knees?’ I could see my eyes light up.  ‘No, because you’re actually rather good-looking in them.’ 

F. ‘Oh. I never thought of it that way.’ I tried to hold his gaze, but all"
" Three theories about sleep: 
1. It's for regeneration. Our bodies and brains are continuously repairing and rechecking data during sleep.
2. It's for learning. During sleep, your brain unblocks and rewrites certain memories which may help it to learn and recall those memories during waking life.
3. It's for renewal. As cells die, the body replaces them with new cells. During sleep, the body repairs and reshapes the cells in your brain and body so they can continue to grow, expand and change throughout your waking life.


Write a story using the first theory about sleep.


I was convinced when my parents told me I needed to get some sleep. It seemed obvious to me what sleep was for: to regenerate, to learn and to renew. As it turned out, I wasn't quite so convinced. I decided to spend my third and final third of my life exploring this theory.


I decided to go to sleep in complete darkness. My parents assured me I would sleep deeply and quickly, as I was so tired from a full day at work. I made sure I ate plenty of protein to replenish my energy levels before bed, and closed my eyes. 

And then, suddenly, I awoke. 

I was disoriented for a moment, but my body soon adjusted and I found myself in total darkness. I was breathing rapidly and my heart was beating faster still. I struggled to keep"," One popular theory is that our bodies need the time to reset and rejuvenate. Another is that sleep is important for mental health. A third maintains that sleep allows our brains to restore their energy levels. All are plausible theories but which is correct is harder to tell.

Use the evidence from the following points to present your theory:

There is evidence for all three theories.
All are plausible theories.
There is insufficient evidence to determine which is the most correct.

Using the above evidence, please choose one of the theories to present as the correct answer.

    

Using the evidence provided, the correct answer is that people spend one-third of their lives asleep for a vital function.

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    ","  In his book The Power of Sleep, Dr Andrew Polk suggests that the body repairs and heals during sleep,  as suggested by the discovery of ""REST"" in 1985.  However, the Cambridge University Study in Sleep Research Group (CUSSRG) state that the brain uses up precious energy during sleep rather than repairing or healing.  So, while we may well be repairing and healing whilst we sleep, it is more likely that we are merely resting our brain, preparing for the next day. The consensus is that we do not know precisely how or why sleep is beneficial.  However sleep has been identified as a key factor in both physical and mental well being.  So, even if we did not know precisely what sleep was doing we would certainly want to take time to sleep.  We can use this article to write a brief outline of why it is essential for us to spend time sleeping, and the benefits of this activity for us, for example:  Our bodies  require repair during sleep.   Whilst we do not fully understand this process,  the body does have ""rest"" during sleep, and we can expect to experience improvements to our physical and mental well being.   We can find that our brain is ready to face the next day with the energy we have replenished during sleep.   As I said, this is still a matter of debate, but we do know that restorative sleep improves our ability to learn and remember, and is essential for","  Sleep is short, but we spend a lot of it.

Write a 3 - 5 sentence summary of the Three theories about sleep.
Sleep is short but we spend a lot of it.  People spend about one-third of their lives asleep.  Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep.  One theory says it has a vital function.  A second says it is an evolutionary mechanism allowing us to recover between meals.  A final theory says it is an efficient use of resources.


Write a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale using the following prompt:

Write a 3 - 5 sentence summary of the Three theories about sleep.

One theory says it has a vital function.  A second says it is an evolutionary mechanism allowing us to recover between meals.  A final theory says it is an efficient use of resources.


Write a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale using the following prompt:

Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that"," One theory says sleep is necessary for the brain to regenerate and repair itself after the stresses of waking life. Another says sleep is necessary for our bodies to heal, and for our minds to process and focus on the things we value the most. A third theory suggests that sleep is not necessary at all and that we are misinterpreting our memories of sleep in order to feel rested. Do you agree with any of these theories?

The three theories about sleep that I know of are as follows: 
1. Sleep is necessary for brain regeneration
2. Sleep is necessary for bodies to heal
3. Sleep is not necessary for either brain regeneration or bodies to heal.

If I were to comment on these theories I might say that the first theory - that sleep is necessary for brain regeneration - is the weakest. This theory has very little evidence to support it, and other less popular theories such as the second and third do seem more plausible. However it is also the case that no one has scientifically proven that sleep is necessary for brain regeneration. 
In summary, I think it would be best to state that the evidence points towards all three of these theories being valid, although the strength of evidence for each is rather weak.


The three theories about sleep that I know of are as follows: 
1. Sleep is necessary for brain regeneration
2. Sleep is necessary for bodies to heal
3. Sleep is not necessary for either brain regeneration or bodies"," However it has become apparent that one way of viewing sleep is not as random as it first seems. Studies show that sleep, which is divided into three stages, or in some cases even more, is the result of preparation for wakefulness; that sleep serves the function of renewal and rest; that sleep helps to stabilise mood.  While some believe sleep is absolutely essential for our mental and physical well-being, others think very little of it. The first theory suggests that sleep is essential to the survival of the body and brain. If you are starving you will sleep for survival, but without sleep there would be no food.  The second theory suggests that sleep is essential to our mental and emotional well-being. There is little joy without sleep to build upon these experiences.  The third theory suggests that our minds tend to wander while sleep deprived.   If we are not sleep deprived why do we sometimes do unhelpful and impractical things? The answer may lie in the fourth theory that sleep plays no role at all in enhancing our mental or physical well-being. This theory accepts that sleep is not only essential, it is the purpose of life.


Sleep:  A theory


The first three paragraphs introduce the idea of sleep and discuss three theories of the function of sleep:  1/3 of life asleep is vital for survival, 2/3 sleep is necessary for renewal and rest, 3/3 sleep helps stabilise mood


The fourth paragraph discusses a theory that"," One theory suggests that sleep is a time for the brain to regenerate and recover from the strain of day-to-day activity. Others think that the body repairs and builds up muscle, or that it plays a key part in controlling the function of the immune system. This last theory is borne out by studies of animals who are kept in total darkness for long periods. These animals suffer a similar reduction in their sleep to those who suffer from insomnia. These findings suggest that sleep is important for maintaining a balance of body functions and may have a role to play in protecting us from the impact of external factors such as radiation. However no one theory seems to be fully supported by the evidence.

  * There are three main theories about sleep. Some scientists think that sleep is important for allowing the brain to regenerate and recover from the strain of day-to-day activity. Others think it is important for the body to repair and build up muscle, and to keep us balanced. Finally, it is thought that sleep plays an important role in protecting us from the impact of outside factors such as radiation. However there is not enough evidence to determine which theory is most correct.

  * One theory about why sleep is so important is that it allows the brain to regenerate and recover from the strain of day-to-day activity. This is because sleep is thought to play a vital role in allowing new cells to grow in the brain. It is also thought that sleep allows the brain to focus on"

“The worst office I’ve been to. The air conditioning is broken. This is not a happy environment,” says Anne who is visiting from Paris. “They all have the same layout, the same carpets, the same furniture, it’s like a collective mourning and I feel sad for them,” she says.

“The people who I met today are not my target audience,” says Simon. “Most of the people that come into my office are not happy. But I can’t really change their environment, I need to change them,” he says.

The consultant says the best office in the survey had the following four elements in place: Good air conditioning and heating, appropriate layout and furnishings, and sufficient space for people to be able to walk around without getting in each other’s way.

This begs the question: what is an “appropriate layout and furnishings”? The ergonomist says the ideal office has a desk that is big enough for the person to sit comfortably and be in eye-contact with their colleague.

The psychologist says the ideal office has a mixture of seating types including sit-stand desks, ergonomic chairs and couches. This way people feel that their workspace allows them to stretch, stand and sit as they prefer.


However, we also hear the following when we ask people if their office is healthy or not: “the air is not clean, I get tired quickly, there is","


The four offices we visited were; an old warehouse space with bare floors, an office with lots of natural light and a good sense of space, a space with bare concrete floors that had been retrofitted for natural light, and then a well designed open floor plan space with lots of natural light and nice chairs.

First impressions; In the old warehouse space, the floors looked cold and unclean. The chairs looked like they were from the early 1900s and we didn’t like the feeling of being stuck in a time warp. As we walked around the office, the sense of space and the feeling of being in a pleasing space followed. As we continued to look around the space we started to see pictures, photos and a very nice office décor sense of place.

What we could see; The warehouse space could have done with a nice cleaning agent. The chairs looked hard and the legs looked flat and tired. The office that had lots of natural light and a good sense of space was cool. There was an air of calm in the room as you could feel the space. The light shone down on the people in the room and the air felt very thick with energy. We were feeling energized by the room. The last space we went to had an open floor plan. The space felt airy and spacious but also cozy. We felt relaxed and the chairs looked comfortable. We felt like we were in a place we belonged.

Our experts; The","  The building health consultant worked with the architect to ensure the working environment of the offices had a healthy mix of natural light, open plan office, ergonomic desk and good access to the outdoors. It was her opinion that office chairs are very similar to furniture in a living room and therefore need to be well padded and supportive.  She noted that many of the chairs in the survey were too flat and did not have a good arch or lumbar support.  Ergonomist 1:  Ergonomic desk is also critical for the optimal comfort.  With all the young millennials and the increase in smartphone use,  there is an emphasis on keeping work and play separate.  He described the importance of having a wide variety of ergonomic options for both sitting and standing.  For example, having options for a laptop on wheels or standing desk. He also noted that the lack of natural light was a concern and many of the participants were using smartphones or tablets to watch videos at home. He recommended having a few windows in the office to supplement the lack of natural light.  He felt the lack of outdoor space and lack of physical proximity to other people was a drawback.  Psychologist 1:  The psychological aspect of this study also was a concern for her. The psychological research done on people’s working conditions has shown that feeling part of a team is more important than the physical environment they work in.  A strong team culture is imperative for employees to feel part of the team"," From our findings the building health consultant was critical of all four for being poorly lit and lacking natural light. The ergonomist had some concerns about the poor chair types and how people were sitting in the rooms we visited; they also had some concerns around the quality of the air in the rooms. In contrast the occupational psychologist was very positive about the energy levels and happiness of the staff in each room that we visited. 

The building health consultant, ergonomist and occupational psychologist are all expert in their fields. The building health consultant and ergonomist are from the industry of architecture. This is an industry which builds buildings and they both have extensive knowledge of construction. The occupational psychologist is an expert in psychology and in our research we found one of her books on mental health. In our story, we will use the testimony of the three experts and our research to build a plot in which there are positive and negative aspects to the buildings we visited. From the experts findings we will draw the following lessons that will be relevant to the plot: 

There is a connection between the lighting and the health of a building. It is well documented that natural light is good for human mental health. 

People sit in chairs in different positions and it is important that chairs are ergonomically designed to the person sitting in them. 

The quality of the air in a building is also important for the mental and physical health of people who work in that environment. 

From our research, the experts"," Each of them will offer their own perspective on how to make a good working environment. Let us know what you think in the comments!


The CEFR scale can be used to classify the type of learning that takes place. It is divided into the following categories:

Type of learner - from A2 (upper secondary school) to E (adults)

The survey asked 100 people how they felt after being at each office for 15 minutes. While some of the findings were surprising, the most notable are how all of the offices had a lack of fresh air or natural light. This affected the health of all of the employees in each office and impacted their productivity, with those in the least healthy office reporting feeling drained. A similar conclusion can be drawn about the lack of healthy options available for lunch in all offices. Many of the people in the least healthy office had a sandwich while some in the most healthy office ate a meal. There was no significant difference in the cost of lunch; all of the sandwiches and meals were within $10 of each other. 

We see a clear correlation between the offices health and productivity. This can be attributed to how little natural light and fresh air were available. The employees in the most healthy office had the most natural light, with windows that allowed in natural light while the least healthy office had windows that were only letting in in a small amount of natural light. Fresh air also had an impact on the health and productivity of the employees; the office with the most fresh air had air filtration systems to keep the air fresh without artificial filters. 

The survey also noted that the offices","  

The four offices chosen for this survey were an academic one with low work intensity, a creative company with a relaxed, flexible approach to working and two business services companies where a lot of desk work is done. In addition, we talked to three employees from each company and found that the survey participants represented a cross section of the workforce.

Based on these findings, the results showed that employees who worked at the higher intensity business services companies, also reported lower levels of psychological well-being in their workplaces. This is not so much down to the stress of the work itself but the lack of resources to support employees in their work,  including appropriate equipment to reduce strain on the body.

The company we visited that had the highest scores in the survey showed a positive and supportive working environment with ample resources to enable high intensity work, including fully equipped workspaces,  ergonomic seating, and the right number of chairs for each person in the office. The other office visited, the creative company, scored highly in terms of support for employees and the environment but scored poorly in terms of high intensity work. They use a mix of comfortable workspaces  with ergonomic seating and flexible working options but there is no dedicated workspace for intense work in their office. However, they have flexible working options  including many informal, flexible options and they have plenty of staff who are not dedicated high intensity workers.


Looking specifically at the three employees in our panel, the academic and low intensity"

The playbill from last night's performance seems to fit your bill, and I would encourage you to use this as inspiration.
""The Crucible"" by Arthur Miller
Actress: Miranda Otto
Director: Marianne Krawetz

Based on the novel by Arthur Miller, this play is a cautionary tale about justice in a small Massachusetts town in the 1960s. 

The titular Crucible pits good vs. evil, to determine the truth of allegations of witchcraft. 

But this trial is just the opening skirmish. There are actually three witch trials going on at once, with different defendants and different accusations. 

Will an innocent girl be convicted of witchcraft, and thereby land in the gallows? 

Will the Puritan leaders, caught between their desire to stamp out evil and their fear of chaos and social unrest, crack under the pressure? 

And what about the accused man, a good Puritan whose only fault is being of the wrong ethnicity, and who is being persecuted for something he had no hand in?

Together, the three trials are a metaphor for how we treat each other and our differences.

I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about.


In the second paragraph, don’t be afraid to put “I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning” in full. A2 readers will not need to read beyond the first paragraph to understand what the third paragraph is getting at.


A2 is the first grade level above second grade. It will make reading a sentence or two above the fourth grade level easier. However, if you want to present what the author is getting at without requiring too much text, then present the first paragraph above the third.


There is an argument for starting the second paragraph above the first. However, given that A2 readers should be able to understand what’s going on from the first paragraph, why not start from there?

The first paragraph explains that the author has 35 years of small children and loves every minute being a father. A2 readers are able to identify with the author’s feelings and understand why he loves being a father.


In summary, if the first and third paragraphs tell the same story, start the"," There is no finer job in the world than being a dad.

When writing stories with prompts it is important to keep the prompt in mind while writing the story. If you try to write the story without the prompt in mind, you run the risk of including too many or too few details that are not relevant to the prompt. For example, if you are writing a prompt about time then details about traffic jams or the time change are not relevant to the prompt.


One way to keep the prompt in mind while writing is to break the prompt down into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, you might begin a story by writing down a single verb (e.g., was, is, have,"," This is also the reason I wrote the play that I am in now; I am in search of the father who abandoned me.

Note: You need to provide your CEFR Code in the email.


A2 Learners in the CEFR scale will be able to understand your story from here to paternity using the following sentence structure: From here to paternity, the theatre director Because of my bizarre personal life which I cannot be proud of, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I am in search of the father who abandoned me.


You can also use the CEFR translation tool to write your story in French.

CEFR Personal data handling; processing of personal data
951 Because of my bizarre personal life which I cannot be proud of, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say"," As I hold this tiny life in my hands I can't help but look at these past 35 years with fondness, laughter, and memories that will last a lifetime. 

The prompt suggests you focus on the following words:  thirty-five years, have, loved, and past. The words that are most difficult to parse in this prompt are the words have and love. These are abstract words with multiple possible dictionary definitions which makes parsing them challenging. A more suitable definition for these words can be found in this Oxford English Dictionary article.

In the example sentence from the prompt, most words are contained in the nouns baby and life. Life is most likely a person or a living thing. Therefore the text can be broken down to have the verb love, and 35 years of small children. 35 years may be broken down to at least ten years and then a number. Therefore the sentence can be broken down into ten years of small children and at least five of love.

Based on this example text, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale suggests that the text is considered to be grade 7, which is a level above the target grade level.

","  When I was younger I had the dream of having a family so I would do anything to be a part of it and now I can say I am a proud father. 

There are a couple of reasons why this text is readable by A2 learners. Firstly, it uses simple sentence patterns and memorised phrases which makes it easy to follow. Secondly, there is a clear indication of the purpose of each scene and the information needed to follow the story. For example, When I was younger I had the dream of having a family so I would do anything to be a part of it is related to the context of my personal life in which I would love to have a family but I do not now. It does not specify any explicit information such as the baby's name or any reference to the father. This is because explicit information is not needed in the story. The text does describe the setting and characters but it does not explicitly mention the baby's name of the father. Finally, the limited number of information points - three - makes the text suitable for A2 learners.

  * Theatre director Because of my bizarre personal life which I cannot be proud of I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about.

" ‘So explain it to me again,’ she said. I was tempted to explain that I didn’t understand it either but that would have caused a diplomatic incident. Instead I went to the vending machine, bought her a bag of smokes and returned to explain I had tried but my attempts had been unsuccessful. She did not seem entirely convinced so I offered to try again the following afternoon. The next day I returned to the machine, this time with a specific type of cigarette that I thought might tempt her. There was a knock on the door and a colleague arrived to enquire what the fuss was about. Told the story, he advised me to give up smoking myself as he was happy for me to join him in giving it a try. After all, what did he have to lose? It was several years before I learnt that he had offered to buy me a pack that very day but I had turned him down. 

Why did he turn down a pack of smokes?
Smoking was a regular and deeply embedded habit for this colleague. He was also a heavy smoker and I don't think it was an unreasonable request to ask him to try giving up. He failed but he made the attempt. Why then did I reject his offer of a pack?
He might have been able to afford to buy me a pack but I was well beyond my supply. I wasn't ready to give up smoking.
To be clear, my colleague did not turn down the"," ‘Just tell them it’s not good for you’ I pleaded. ‘Who says it’s not good for you?’ she demanded, ‘people who care about you or your own conscience?’ ‘Both’, I replied. ‘Then be more specific, you little twat,’ she snarled before turning her attention back to her work.

After a few minutes I was tempted to tell her that even if it wasn’t good for you it was good for me as it made me a much healthier person and probably made me pretty now too. I could have explained how every morning when I wake up I feel incredibly good which means I wake up feeling great. All of this made it much easier for me to give up and I did so without feeling deprived or like an imposter. I suppose she could have done the same by just not being so judgemental. Perhaps the lesson here is that it is okay to be human and have health issues if you also respect the individual and their choice to live how they choose to live. 

After several moments of silence the conversation returned to normal and for the rest of the afternoon I felt sorry for my colleague. The lesson seems to have passed her by though as she soon resumed being furious.

This was an engaging story that explained the difference between expecting others to change based on your behaviour and respecting their own choice to live how they want. 

The writer used a few interesting examples such as giving up smoking which made the listener"," ‘You just stop when you quit,’ I finally said. ‘I don’t smoke again until tomorrow,’ she said, then stormed out of the office.

The next day I went to the bank to cash some wages and was surprised to see a large pile of my savings in her name. I asked the bank manager what had happened and he explained that my colleague had signed a new mortgage over my signature without my knowledge or consent. I was shocked and reported the incident to my employers.  They explained that the bank had acted in good faith and that they could not believe my colleague would do such a thing but that I should report the matter to the police.

I reported the incident to the police and after several hours of waiting in a police station with a friend I decided to check the internet for information on how to file a claim against a bank. I read that the most important document was the deed of mortgage (mortgages are recorded in land registry) which was filed with the registry office. I went to the local registry office and asked an assistant where the deed of mortgage was filed and he pointed to a cupboard at the back of the building. I took a cupboard key and opened the door but found that the cupboard was locked. The assistant suggested that I return the following day but I said that I would do so the following day as the lawyer I was talking to was having difficulty with a similar matter and needed to check the file. The next"," In true Flesch-Kincaid style, our colleague was too complex for a story so here is a simplified version for Grade 2 learners. ‘A few weeks ago I gave up smoking, but to be honest it wasn’t that easy because I just changed from a daily smoker to a non-smoker overnight. I thought everyone would be pleased but one colleague was absolutely furious.' Well, that’s a relief. The story still needs work as there is no real evidence that Flesch-Kincaid has any real relevance, but the basic idea is there. The idea of the story is a simple one, and as I said it may be a little weak on evidence, but there is still much to admire. The use of simple language and a simple beginning, middle and end make this an easy read for both adults and Grade 2 learners. The story does not over explain and makes a good point. There is no real evidence of how simple language compares to technical language in terms of difficulty for children. For example, it is not always easy for children to understand that one can change from a non-smoker to a daily smoker overnight, nor that this is a problem, simply because one has changed. There is no strong evidence that the story is even usable and is very poorly written, but the basic idea is there. My favourite story in the original Flesch-Kincaid prompt was this one. ‘New Kid on the Block – A"," But I guess the colleague couldn’t accept that simply by giving up she had somehow failed to persuade me to give up with me. I was never going to become a nonsmoker overnight. Not everything in life is that straightforward.

Your story is a good example of how not to communicate with colleagues, as well as showing that, despite efforts to change, some things simply cannot be changed overnight. Although the colleague may have been unhappy, she may have been over-reacting, and perhaps even partly to blame for not making an effort to make you stop. This is a challenging situation that many colleagues will react to differently, which is to be expected. An important skill is effective communication, so that colleagues can work together to achieve a shared goal. Try to be mindful of this situation in the future, and try to be more empathetic to different reactions.

In conclusion, we would like to encourage you to continue to communicate effectively with colleagues, as this is an important skill that will serve you well in your role and in your career.

In this lesson, we will explore the main differences between short- and long-term goals, and their implications for how you communicate. We will also explore effective ways to communicate short-term goals, and make your goals more achievable.

Goals in short-term and long-term frames of reference

There are two main types of goals: short-term goals, which typically last from a few hours to"," ‘What do you mean you couldn’t stop?’ she persisted. I tried to explain. ‘I just couldn’t. It’s just the way it was. It’s not like I sat around eating crisps all day or something.’ She sniffed. ‘That’s not the point. It doesn’t matter how much you smoke. You’ve smoked for years and now you’re not smoking. That’s not normal. You should have been able to stop a long time ago.’


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a measure of readability that takes into account the number of words, sentences, and syllables in a document. Grade 2 learners will enjoy this story because of the use of active language to describe the difficulty of giving up smoking: ‘it’s just the way it was’, ‘it doesn’t matter how much you smoke’, and ‘you should have been able to stop a long time ago’. The use of active verbs and simple sentences help to make this story easier to understand even for learners with lower reading levels.


The first paragraph introduces the main character who struggles to give up smoking. The use of active language makes this a quick and engaging story for readers at Grade 2.

Grade 2 learners would enjoy this"," However, I thought the issue was clear. My company had given me an award for being a role model for other staff, which had been presented to me the previous week. To which I replied that it must have slipped her mind. ‘Oh well, I suppose I will have to find someone else to present it to then,’ I mused. I called my boss to explain my failure. After some discussion, we worked out that I would need to attend a ceremony on the following Wednesday to formally present the award. I was concerned I might be too late but was reassured that I only needed to be present and then return the award to the CEO a week later, once the deadline had passed. ‘You will have given up smoking by then, so there will be nothing to present,’ quipped my boss. Undaunted, I bought a packet of cigarettes the following day and had one final fag that night, then went to sleep on a satisfied high. Unfortunately, the following Wednesday came and went without my receiving any award. When I phoned the CEO to present the award, I was informed that he had received a written statement from my colleague, claiming that I had tried to stop smoking but had failed. ‘You promised you would be a non-smoker by the next day,’ she shouted. The award was withdrawn, and so ended one of the most thrilling and exhilarating periods of my life. I thought I’d done the right thing. After all,"

writing a good essay"," Why is that? Firstly because I was learning by reading. I was reading and rereading the homework books and as a result was getting the feel of a particular spelling and punctuation rule – an expected, but not always best, approach to a complex topic. This approach was then copied onto the essay which provided me with the opportunity to practise the language in a different context and also help me to remember and structure the essay. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I was writing the essay ‘live’ and correcting any mistakes as I went. No longer! I have a Word file of my essays from school. They all look very similar, save for some typos and grammatical errors. They are not easy essays to write but, unfortunately, they are now very difficult to correct. This is because I am no longer looking at the text, trying to ‘understand’ and make sense of it and instead I am staring at a fixed, and static, Word document. The text has been dumbed down, to a state of near-perfection, where I can neither detect mistakes nor make them. The only difference that I can perceive is an occasional missing apostrophe in a sentence, or an incorrect tense shift, but I would love to be able to see, or hear, the text as it was originally written. Is there any way for me to go back? Is there some software that can read my handwritten text and return it to its original form, with all the errors intact", What makes a good piece of writing? When I started teaching A2 at school I was given a copy of the book The Elements of Style edited by Strunk and White which I heartily recommend. The principles are these: Do not write above your level. Never use a active voice to talk about actions that were already done to the reader. When a verb tense is unnecessary avoid using any. Avoid abbreviations and slang. Keep sentences short. Avoid unnecessary words. Keep sentences parallel. Avoid unnecessary prepositions. Avoid unnecessary prepositions. Avoid redundancy. Avoid excess verbiage. Avoid writing in the first person. Avoid impersonal sentences. Avoid adjectives superfluous to the noun they qualify. Avoid adjectives superfluous to the noun they qualify.

What impact did the move from paper to screen (specifically the transition from typewriters to computerised word processing software) have on the reading skills of people who wrote handwritten school essays? 
The transition from paper to screen had a negative impact on the reading skills of people who wrote handwritten school essays. The transition from typewriters to computers reduced the number of crossings-out in school essays. This reduced the need to rewrite the school essays, making the pleasure in reading the handwritten school essays harder to imagine.

In fact most people would argue that good writing doesn’t need much effort at all. The quality of the ideas, the passion and imagination that the writer has invested in the subject are far more important to the reader. These qualities can be found in abundance on the internet, and yet many readers still prefer the lack of effort of reading content online. Why is this? Many believe that people are simply more distracted by content that does not require their active engagement, rather than less distracted because of good writing. I would suggest two key reasons that make writing that requires effort more interesting to a learner. First, good writing requires planning, something that a passive reader cannot understand or appreciate. Second, although most people like content that does not require significant effort, many have an innate desire to engage with a piece of writing and are willing to put in the effort to understand it. In other words, despite how good writing is, people want it to be easy!

"," In primary school we are taught to write by rote and to ignore any inner voice that suggests we will be regretting our written words at some point in the future. I would argue that this rote approach to writing is not so rote after all.  

This is not to say that careful and attentive writing comes easily. It requires careful attention to what you are writing, the words you are using and the structure of your sentences. In particular, I would argue that careful and attentive writing should also be punctuated and capitalised correctly. Punctuation and capitalisation are the linguistic devices that help us manage our written communications. If you are struggling to find the right words and the right punctuation to use then spending time reviewing your punctuation and capitalisation will help you ensure your audience understand your meaning and enjoy your words. 

Some words are harder to spell, read and write than others. One such word that creates anxiety when we look back on our school essays is ‘pass’. To this day I still find it awkward to write ‘Pass’ and my heart sinks when I see other people typing this incorrect character. I still struggle with this word now. The reason I find this word so difficult is that it is frequently misspelled and wrongly capitalised. ‘Pass’ would be better written as ‘Passes’ in my opinion. This correct spelling and capitalisation of words and phrases is referred to as ‘punctuation’. This word is not easy"," 
As a schoolboy I used to enjoy the school dictionary, particularly its definitions of words. Today I would struggle to define the word ‘courage’. Fortunately school also gave us thesauruses, giving us the opportunity to use thesaurus terms when writing. Thesaurus terms are words created by combining the main words in the dictionary together with alternative words that have similar meanings. 
‘Courage’ is a good example of a thesaurus term which in the Collins English Dictionary is defined as ‘the quality or state of being brave’. Using this alternative definition I would re-word my former attempt at a definition and avoid using the archaic word ‘courageous’. 
When one of the examiners read back my essay from the A2 level text they commented that my sentences had ‘simple sentence patterns with memorised phrases’ and that I used explicit information and limited number of information points. In summary they found the text to be easy to read and informative. The examiner also noted that I used thesaurus terms. 
This is great to hear, particularly the use of thesaurus terms, as many language learners find it difficult to use explicit words. Indeed many language learners prefer to use implicit words like adjectives or pronouns rather than explicit words. However, although my sentences contained simple sentence patterns with memorised phrases and I used explicit information and limited number of information points, my examiner still assessed my text as A2 level.

" The rain thrummed and drummed against the neon marquees overhead and the windows of the shops and restaurants that lined the avenue. Ahead, on the even side, the sun had set, leaving a lingering orange glow that glimmered off the rain-flattened asphalt. I paused at the corner to let a cab make the turn, and when it did I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. A large form lurched forward at the same time as a smaller figure stumbled after it. The larger figure came to an abrupt halt and stared in disbelief at the smaller one, a child, who was crying and pointing at its hand. ""What did you just do, huh?"" it demanded. The smaller figure was no more than six or seven years old, with a shock of blonde hair that fell across his face. I squinted and moved closer, my hood up over my woolen coat. ""Why would I do anything?"" the larger figure demanded. ""You just nicked our son's hand with a knife!"" ""What?"" The larger figure spun and reached for his pocket but it was empty, and when it didn't pull out a knife on the spot I knew that the smaller figure had simply taken it from its pocket. The larger figure glowered, a vein in its forehead pulsing. ""That's a lie. He attacked me first!"" It reached again for its pocket, and this time I saw blood on its hand. ""I"," I wasn't sure if it was the dark clothing or my nerves but I stopped twice on the way down the street to check my surroundings before proceeding. I'd just crossed over the Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge and my attention was caught by a man in a long black coat with a hood striding towards me on the other side of the street. I stepped off the curb in an attempt to continue walking, but then I realized it was the hooded man in the dark clothing who had been striding towards me. His eyes seemed to glow under the hood, shining in the dull, rainy streetlights like alien orbs. He reached out a hand and I took it, letting him guide me towards a bus stop where we both stopped. The man in the long black coat drew back the hood, revealing the bus driver's face, and for a brief, split-second I saw my life in the bus driver's eyes: My face, my body, my purpose, my reason for being. Without warning he opened the bus door and motioned me inside. I remember that his face was so kind, his eyes so clear, and yet something in his gaze seemed so dark and foreboding that I involuntarily recoiled. He leaned forward and offered his hand. When I shook it, I saw something in his grip: A gun. A.38 revolver. He smiled at me, and in that split-second I knew I was gone, I was gone."," The city was quiet, the usual bustle diminished due to the weather. I turned into the alley to my right and entered the gloomy interior of the tenement building, and the silence was shattered by the frantic scuff of running feet and loud shouts from the street. I crouched down against the cold brick of the alleyway and watched through the dirty panes of the front window. A crowd of people were gathered around the front stoop of the tenement building, and everyone was pointing to the left of where I was standing. I looked to my left and saw an overturned motor scooter, and a young boy I guessed to be no older than 8 was helping to pick up the pieces. I made eye contact with the boy, and he immediately looked up at me with fear in his eyes. I smiled and walked toward him. He held his hands up pleadingly, and I reached into my pocket to offer him some change. As I was about to hand the boy the money, he darted away through the crowd and disappeared down the alley. I turned back to the window and saw that the crowd was dispersing, and I slowly made my way out of the alley and returned to the warm embrace of the pouring rain.


This experience provides a window into a number of factors that can affect the story telling of low-skill workers in A2 classrooms:

The weather. Weather can have a significant impact on the narrative skills of low-sk"," I paused at the corner of 20th Street to catch my breath and assess my surroundings. It was quiet. Perfect.  

The pavement was uneven, pocked with potholes, but Philadelphia Avenue, unlike Broadway or Madison Avenue, was laid out as a more casual avenue, with fewer sweeping turns and pedestrians milling about.  

I continued a few paces and again paused, this time to take in the street life. A woman with a red umbrella came jogging the other way. A pair of teenage boys in basketball shirts were skipping across the street. A man in a suit and a woman in a skirt were conversing at the intersection of 23rd Street. A young man with a bag full of books and a laptop was walking along at a leisurely pace, the only pedestrian to be found, it seemed, on this late evening of July 4th celebration.

This is how I came to find myself at the corner of 24th Street, standing there in the late evening drizzle, peering around me and trying to figure out what I had come to do. And then it hit me. There it was: the big question mark: the giant question mark emblazoned across the front of the building at the corner of 24th Street and Philadelphia Avenue.  

I peered around, searching, and then, in the gloom, I could just make it out. The letters had been freshly painted, I could see that much. The"," As I passed the end of the park, I emerged into the bustling mid-block street scene. The lights of the avenue were ablaze with animated activity. Pedestrians moved purposefully, dogs barked, motorized traffic sped by. I had arrived in the thick of the action. 
Philadelphia Avenue is one of the main streets of Washington, DC, and is a major street intersection. It is a busy shopping street, where many people buy food and merchandise at many stores. It is also a busy street where many people ride bikes, scooters, Rollerblades, and push scooters. Philadelphia Avenue is paved for most of the street, except for a patch in the middle. This patch is covered by a thin sheet of asphalt. 

As I walked, I noticed that the patch was full of skateboarders, rollerbladers, and bikers. Most of them seemed to be going in the opposite direction than me. I was surprised and started to walk toward the middle of the street, expecting to find other people like me. However, I soon saw that most people on Philadelphia Avenue were headed toward the opposite direction as me. I was surprised again, but this time started to turn back toward the patch to go the other way. 

As I passed by the center of the patch, I saw a group of about ten bikers and riders gathered on the patch. The group was laughing, riding around, and"," My sneakers slapped out a steady beat as I picked my way carefully down the uneven asphalt, careful not to trip over the uneven sidewalk stones littering the avenue. Despite the rainy conditions, the street was bustling with activity, with people rushing to and from the trains at Broad and Market, eager to avoid the downpour, and the nearby parks for their nightly performances.

" But the reason Einstein is known by everyone is because of his two famous laws of relativity. 

These laws helped shift our perception of space-time, our ability to comprehend it, and how we can relate to it. We now have an idea of how time and distance is calculated with reference to a single point in space. 

These are laws that continue to impact our modern day, and impact every aspect of how we live our lives. However, in 1905, when he came up with these laws, Albert Einstein was only 25 years old.


A storyboard for your story might go something like this:

Objectives

To name a scientist who has had an impact on our world.
To name a scientist who has had an impact on space-time.
To name a scientist who is known by everyone.
To explain Einstein's two famous laws of relativity.
To explain how the laws impacted our modern day.


Culturally appropriate science

When describing a scientific discovery you should include the following elements:

Who made the discovery?
What discovery?
What field was the discovery in?
What significance did the discovery have?
What impact did the discovery have on the field?
What were the practical implications of the discovery?

When writing the first paragraph of a story about a scientific discovery you should explain what field the discovery was in. This will help the reader identify with the discovery and will set a context for"," We even saw him on a £10 note! When did we last meet?... in fact you never met. You may have though of Albert Einstein when you read a book or watched a TV program but you didn't really meet him.... he wouldn’t have had the time or energy to meet you. 

The first paragraph should introduce the reader to Einstein and then tell a little of his interesting story. 

Einstein was a Jewish German born in 1879. He received his education in Germany. In his youth he had read about the biblical Patriarch Abraham and after reading about him became interested in Jewish history, culture and religion. In 1887 he moved to Switzerland and in Switzerland became a citizen and was able to practice law. After 9/11 the United States Government honored him with its highest civilian award the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He was known for his contributions to physics, his philosophy on religion and race and for his famous quote, ""In nature there is no purpose; everywhere, in trees, plants and animals, in the universe, is the proof of its brevity. Man has become so accustomed to the idea of purpose that he fails to see the evidence of the eternity of the universe""

"," What Albert Einstein didn’t know is that his fame spread far beyond the science community. Einstein, who started his career as an itinerant philosopher, would not have believed the extent to which his work on general relativity would change the face of physics and astronomy. Despite his protestation that he had ‘nothing to do with religion’, his friend, friend, Michele Besso, commented that ‘God plays an enormous role in his life’ (as quoted by Walter Benjamin). Einstein didn’t die in 1955, but his relevance as a thinker is very much alive. In particular, his ideas around the possibility of an outside force creating a pocket universe have recently captured the public’s imagination, with many people now arguing that aliens might have created these universes in an attempt to interact with humans. 

What did Albert Einstein actually do? 
Einstein was born on 14 April 1879. At university, he studied physics and eventually went on to receive a doctorate in 1915, at which point he became famous for his general theory of relativity. However, while he was at university he was also working on a number of other ideas that formed the foundations of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. These ideas did not receive wide attention at the time, and it was not until 1915 that Einstein began to receive the recognition he would subsequently receive for his work on relativity.


Einstein’s celebrity was not limited to physics. He started his academic career as an itinerant philosopher, and"," He is famous for his groundbreaking general theory of relativity, which revolutionised our understanding of gravity. However, his actual work was to do with quantum mechanics, which is the study of the smallest particles that make up everything around us, and explains a lot about the natural world around us.


The first step is to understand what each term means. Once you know the meaning of the terms, you can use the Flesch-Kincaid grade level to grade the readability of the passage.


Grading the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level


This is a scale that can be used to grade the readability of text. The higher the score, the easier the passage is to read. For this passage, the score is 54.9.


The following is a description of the Grade Level scale


Grade Level Scores are calculated using the following formula: Grade Level = 20 / (Log10 (average words in passage))


This passage has an average of 12.55 words. Log10 (12.55) = 10.27, so the Grade Level score for this passage is 54.9.


We can now understand what level the passage is at. This means that if anyone asks you to name a scientist, you’re likely to remember Albert Einstein. All we have to do is remind ourselves of the term he is most famous for, and that’s likely to do the trick.


If we"," Although his name is associated with physics, he was more than happy to offer an ear to anyone who had a question. But why has this been forgotten today? His fame seems to have waned in recent decades and his reputation has been downplayed by both friends and enemies as part of a political strategy to weaken him in his final years. There is one man who has fought to bring Einstein back into the mainstream and that man is the President of France. He recently made him an honorary citizen of France. The move won’t put him on the map like Einstein was but it will show that the president of France cares about science and he wants people to focus on the positive achievements it can bring to the society we live in.

The story doesn't need to be based in the past. Infact it can be any scientist who was known for a positive contribution to society.

"," But the name Albert was coined by his Swiss mother when he was just a baby.  

The Swiss have an interesting habit of spelling the name Albert with an ‘e’ at the end of words like ‘courage’ which is why many people believe that Albert Einstein was named after the Swiss physicist.  

This story is designed to debunk this notion by giving an alternative history and revealing how Albert Einstein’s name actually came about.  

The story goes that the name Albert Einstein came about because his Swiss mother was having a difficult time pronouncing the name and, wanting to help, she coined the word ‘albertein’ meaning ‘albert’ in the form of a diminutive.  

So what does this mean for a 10 year old child?  It means that Albert Einstein was actually named after the Swiss mother who helped him out of a difficult situation!  

This interesting tale shows that the name Albert Einstein has much deeper meaning than you might think.  

Have fun writing this story!

So what does this mean for a 10 year old child? It means that Albert Einstein was actually named after the Swiss mother who helped him out of a difficult situation!

"," He’s known to be one of the most famous scientists of all time for his contribution to general relativity, which is to say he did lots of cool stuff. However, at the end of the day he was a very smart human who was mostly indifferent to women.  

The story could start with a quotation from Albert Einstein, however a more creative approach would be to ask the learner to imagine Einstein and write a story based on what he might do. A good starting point might be “Imagine Albert Einstein. He is an intelligent human who works in his lab all day, but when you ask him what he would do if he were not a scientist, he would probably say: ‘I would be a doctor or an artist or a football player, it doesn’t matter, as long as I am doing what I love.’  And then he might go on to explain that he realised this when he was a small child.  

Einstein is an example of the “memorised phrase” classification within the CEFR framework. The CEFR categorises text into three levels: A0 (No memorised phrases), A1 (Memorised phrases) and A2 (Basic sentence patterns with explicit information).  The text demonstrates “memorised phrases” with phrases like “at the end of the day he was a very smart human who was mostly indifferent to women.” The text also demonstrates explicit information using explicit information points like the name of a scientist. Finally,"
" There are now large libraries of astronomical books, and amateur astronomers can make detailed sky maps and even conduct observational research. Amateur astronomy has also developed as a distinct branch of astronomy, with many highly effective and popular online resources. One thing has not changed though - astronomy is a fascinating subject and many people enjoy looking at the night sky and learning about the universe around us. 

Here is one possible story for you: Two friends meet up for lunch one bright afternoon. One of the friends works at a local planetarium where he offers night-sky and planetary-observations for a small fee, while the other friend is just an enthusiast who looks up at the sky for pleasure. As they sit down, their conversation naturally turns to astronomy, and they start comparing the different constellations across the sky. It's not long before the friends have discovered that the stars in their own sky are in a different constellation from the friends that the second friend has found. At first they both feel disappointed - they have always thought they had the same constellations in the sky. But on second thought, they realise that this is because their sky is now slightly tilted forward! They have just moved to a different location, and their old sky map is no longer valid.

When they look up at the same stars, they realise that their second friend is now seeing the same constellation in a different part of the sky. Both of them now feel close to the universe and are"," Even beginners can get started with reasonably priced gear and find out a bit about how the heavenly bodies work. At the same time amateur astronomy has flourished, and thousands of people pursue careers as professional amateurs who make their living from astrophotography. 
Professional amateurs are not only able to make a living doing astrophotography, but also find inspiration from this unique and rewarding career. Professional amateurs who make their living astrophotography often make important contributions to our knowledge about the stars and our place in the Universe. 
The recent advent of affordable astrophotography has opened up many exciting possibilities. Professional amateurs are able to capture images of deep space that were impossible just a few decades ago. A few examples are the following: 

- the first image of an interstellar cloud of gas and dust. This was done by a team of amateurs that used the 6-inch (15-cm) telescope of the Sutherland Observatory in South Africa. The cloud, called IC 5146, is located about 800 light-years away from Earth. 
- an image of a pulsar in the constellation Gemini, for which amateurs were the first to record the transit of the pulsed light from the neutron star. This pulsar, called Geminga, is one of only three known radio pulsars. 
- the first image of a black hole, and the first ever images of a galaxy that is in the process of being torn apart by"," In addition, many new areas of astronomy have opened up: Black-Hole Astrophysics, the study of Quasars and other Active Galactic Nuclei, the development of Super-Earths around other stars, and the list goes on. All of this means that anyone with a little astronomy knowledge and a telescope can start their own amateur astronomy group.

The amateur astronomy group will use a small telescope on clear night to look at the stars.  They will look for planets, double stars and galaxies.  The amateurs will be using their telescopes to learn and improve their astronomy knowledge.

The book ""Stars: Their Lives and Their Significance to Us All"" written by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan is a good starting point for anyone interested in astronomy. It talks about how astronomers first started, the equipment used by astronomers and the modern equipment used today to study the universe.

The book starts with ""Where No Man Has Gone Before""  which talks about how scientists and engineers built the telescopes to study the universe and how these telescopes opened our eyes to the beauty of the cosmos and how we are only now beginning to understand how the universe began and the incredible complexities of life and the universe.

The book ""The Day After"" written by Brian Cox and Niven Biggs is another great read on the changes in astronomy over the last few decades. It talks about how our perception of the universe has changed and how the technology available"," There are hundreds of books on astronomy and there are thousands of websites for users of amateur equipment. Astronomy has become accessible to people of all ages. There is a growing interest in astronomy among children in the age range from 5 years old to university students who have taken courses in astronomy. Because of the number of accessible sources of information, astronomy is now considered to be a subject for beginners and intermediate levels.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, first published in 1965, is a measure of the level of difficulty of English text as computed by type of reading audience (e.g. adults, children) and type of material (e.g. newspapers, books). A value of 75 is typical for material aimed at a general adult audience and a value of 50 is typical for material aimed at a child audience.

    Amateur Astronomy, Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. There are hundreds of books on astronomy and there are thousands of websites for users of amateur equipment. Astronomy has become accessible to people of all ages. There is a growing interest in astronomy among children in the age range from 5 years old to university students who have taken courses in astronomy. Because of the number of accessible sources"," Astronomy clubs have sprung up in almost every school and many libraries now have a collection of textbooks, journals and other material on astronomy for teachers. The amateur astronomer has a much higher success rate in finding new and interesting objects in the night sky than the professional astronomer. Amateur astronomers may have to take a number of precautions to reduce the risk of accident or injury whilst observing. Some may choose to wear special eye-guards while using high powered telescopes. They should also be aware that the light pollution from cities can reduce the amount of faint and distant objects that can be seen. Some amateur astronomers also use astrophotography which allows them to take photographs of the night sky without the need for a telescope. This can be especially useful for pictures of the Sun or other brighter objects in the sky. The amateur astronomer may wish to take up a hobby like photography in order to make money to supplement their astronomy work. The Hubble Space Telescope was sent up as part of NASA's Space Program from 1990 until 1993. The Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is currently scheduled for launch in 2023. There are also professional astronomers who work at research universities, observatories and from businesses such as Planet Earth Imaging. These professional astronomers use telescopes to study the night sky in order to learn more about the cosmos, planets and other objects in the universe which can be illuminated by natural light and starlight.

"," There are excellent sky surveys from both ground-based and space telescopes, and even digital sky atlases are available. Astronomy has become as popular as TV or movies and many books are written about astronomical subjects. As well as general astronomy books there are specialist books for particular parts of the world, for example books in Arabic, Chinese or Japanese, and a wide range of books are available on different types of planets, comets, galaxies and other astronomical objects. At present the two most popular celestial objects at the moment are the Moon and Venus. Venus is of course the subject of one of the great love stories in the history of literature, Helen's Hero by Donna Jo Napoli. Venus is the beautiful princess of Dahomey and when she is betrothed to Prince Hector she embarks upon a spectacular affair with the King's brother, Lord Palmetto. Palmetto takes Venus on a tour of the world and lands him in the most glamorous part of the world - London. Venus is astonished by the city but finds it an improvement on her own Dahomey and the King is delighted and prepares the contract. Venus and Lord Palmetto set out for the wedding. On the day of the ceremony Venus is shocked to see that Palmetto has changed. Venus had taken him on his word that he was going to travel to London in a very beautiful carriage and Palmetto now emerges in a much shabbier coach. Palmetto"," We can find charts and catalogues for virtually any object within the entire sky. The internet makes it easy to find the data we need without needing specialized equipment. New techniques also make discoveries easier. Many amateur astronomers make new discoveries every day. It takes a lot of dedication to learn from scratch about new and interesting objects. But with enough persistence and a little luck you can also get very close to some of these fascinating planets and celestial bodies. The planets Mars, Venus, Mercury, Saturn and Jupiter can all be viewed in the evenings in our backyard and backyard observatory. The Moon shows up as a shiny, white light. Venus shines brightly during evening hours. This is a nice view to have and we can all learn a lot from amateur astronomers around the world. To observe Venus, we just need a low-cost telescope with a wide aperture or a binocular. Venus is much closer to Earth now than when the dinosaurs were around and we just need to know where to look! Many of these objects can only be viewed when the Moon is full or in conjunction, so we have to look for a dark sky location with a well-lit moon. And we need to be ready to spend a couple of hours or even more if the object comes into view only at a few minutes later. When we see something interesting we can contact amateur astronomers via email or chat on a popular astronomical website like MessierWatch or SkyWatch. This allows you to observe the object"
" 

Think of some artists you have heard of. The artist da Vinci, Picasso, Michelangelo, etc. Ask yourself who appreciated their work in the past and why. 

Artists can create whatever they wish and are not beholden to what anyone else thinks of their work. This freedom allows artists to explore new and different mediums. Art should not be ashamed of it's past nor should it be concerned with what others think. Art has the ability to shock, move us, and stimulate.

I agree with this article overall. The only thing I disagree with is the statement that Art is not beholden to what anyone else thinks of it's work. Art is beholden to the viewers ability to perceive what the artist has intended. We are still living in the dark ages when it comes to digital media, but in the near future, it is only a matter of time until a digital version of an original painting by the painter da Vinci is at our fingertips. While the painter da Vinci lives, we will still be able to appreciate the beauty of his work. Our ability to understand what is beautiful is evolving every day. We will no longer admire Picasso or da Vinci because they were innovative or different than previous art forms. We admire them because their art form was beautiful and they told a visually pleasing story. 

I love art and hope to one day be a well known artist. I spend time with my art every day and try"," We seem to think that the only truly original work is the work of a contemporary artist. And yet all great artists throughout the ages have been in complete agreement that art should be timeless, that it should not express the author's personality or ideology, and that it should celebrate beauty. In this way, all great artists have been contemporaries, and they all understood that it is through constant, uncompromising innovation that great art grows and that it is only by continually revising and reinvigorating themselves through this constant revision that artists truly express themselves as the artists they are.  

The prompt encourages the writer to discuss what it means to ""rebel against the art of his contemporaries"" and to explain why ""all great artists throughout the ages have been in complete agreement that art should be timeless, that it should not express the author's personality or ideology, and that it should celebrate beauty.""


#### The concept of ""contemporaries"" and ""rebel"" is defined: 
Contemporaries are artists who were active during the same time period.

Rebel against the art of his contemporaries means departing from previously popular styles and techniques.

This concept of contemporaries and rebel against the art of his contemporaries is echoed throughout the art history of the Western world. Some of the most famous artists throughout the ages include Cimabue, Giotto, Caravaggio, and Vermeer, all of whom were contempor"," Why, then, are we not satisfied with what others have done? Shouldn't art be about transcending what has gone before and delighting us with something original, praiseworthy and deserving of our attention? Modernist thought seems to have set us up for disappointment. 

Modernist art was founded on the idea that art must break with traditional methods of  painting, sculpture and architecture in order to be truly innovative and influential. This new attitude led to a radical shift in the way people viewed art. 
Traditional art was seen as the preserve of the elite, while the new, radical art was accessible to anyone who could afford the materials and skills needed to produce it.  The new style was a radical departure from the high quality paintings and sculptures of the past.  The style was called modernist because it was a reaction to the classicism of the past and instead looked to the future.  A good modernist painting would have simple lines and colors and a new perspective on old works of art. 

But what happens when you ask a modernist to paint a picture that no one complained about a century ago? What if the subject has not changed but the way we look at it has? Modernist thought seems to have set us up for disappointment.  Our contemporary art should be bold, original and inspiring but instead most of it is derivative and predictable.  What do we learn from this?  
Contemporaries do not have to be a"," This is no way to make art. 

Art should be seen, not heard.

However I believe it is important to note that the art of each era is the result of a creative response to the culture and times in which it was created. The following quote is a counter example to the above paragraph: “Titian’s paintings are not necessarily better or worse than those of his predecessors and contemporaries. They are the result of his genius; the only thing they have in common with the works of his predecessors is that they are all paintings.” 

I believe the above quote perfectly expresses the complex nature of art and why the art of the past is not necessarily better than the art of today: it is the result of the unique genius of the individual painter who lived at that time. The critic who says that Titian’s paintings are better than those of his predecessors is simply not acquainted with Titian.

A counter example to the above quote: the works of Picasso and Chagall are not better than other works of theirs’s contemporaries because they are the result of their unique genius. Their paintings are simply better.

The quote, in summary, is incomplete and misleading. It does not explain how art, in general, has changed throughout the ages. In fact, if we had to create a sentence that could fit between the lines of the paragraph above, it would be the following: art is the result of the unique genius of the individual artist living at the time.

“Art” from the","  

Why is this?  

One possible answer lies in the way that most people now search the world wide web. This practice has led to the explosion of ""blog"" posts, youtube channels, and other ""content sites"" offering a wide variety of creative works. This explosion in content makes it harder to determine what is ""new"" or even what is art.  

Consider this passage from a book by David Foster Wallace on the art movement of the 1960's, A Supplement to the Qabalah:  

...the generation whose work was born in the 1960's has, in my opinion, done an immense, even revolutionary, service to Western civilization, for which it may be thanked. I suspect that almost the only people now alive who have any notion of what Western civilization once was, how it was once conceived, and how different it once seemed will find the story of the birth of the punk movement in 1968 to be a fascinating study in the decline and fall of an idea.

In the past few years this tendency to praise modern art has had its ups and downs and I think I can identify the reason for it. We admire the artist who dares to be different, who paints an image that goes against the grain. They have bold ideas, unconventional thoughts or perhaps an image that is so far-out that it is not considered mainstream. They challenge society and what is considered ""normal"". Somewhere along the line the world lost sight of the fact that art is meant to appeal to and inspire people - just as much as it should move them to tears, shake them to their core or even just make them laugh. 
Modern art today often appeals to the lowest common denominator. The mainstream artist paints a well-known subject or an idea that is so deeply embedded in our collective subconscious that it is almost impossible to avoid them. 
If we want to call art what it is and not something different then we should just acknowledge that it is there to entertain and inspire. If it does neither of those for you then you should not be judging it as art, you should be judging it as a work of art. It should make you cry, laugh or feel something. If it makes you feel angry or frustrated or bored then it is not art, it is a work of art. If it makes you feel calm"
" Fashion during these centuries became more of a way of life, a reflection of the way that people dressed and the colours and designs they chose to incorporate into their clothing. Wealthy citizens of European cities would travel abroad in search of new fashions, returning to their home cities to import these fashions from the Netherlands, Northern Europe, and the Netherlands India. By the nineteenth century fashions had become a way for wealthy citizens to express their individuality, their social position and their connection to the aristocracy. By the twentieth century fashion had become a powerful tool for class distinction. In the first instance this has led to discrimination against women. Women were expected to dress in a feminine manner, and this was often seen as a sign of weakness, an example of 'being girlish'. In the workplace women were expected to dress in a manner which would be suitable for their workplace, and there has been ongoing discrimination throughout history against women in the workplace who don't dress in what are perceived as appropriate ways. However this is only one manifestation of fashion. There has always been resistance to the imposition of a new fashion and this often leads to a reworking and reinvention of existing styles. Fashions are not rigid and they change over time. Often they are even subversive of existing cultural assumptions about the ideal way to live. From this perspective it is perhaps easier to understand why even some of the most established and influential groups have continually resisted fashion. They might find it impossible to"," Then came the Industrial Revolution in the second half of the nineteenth century leading to a growing reliance upon factory production and mass manufacture of goods, which again created new markets for existing styles of dress which had been developed for more isolated households and local markets.  The arrival of mass media in the twentieth century created demand for accessible styles of dress, which led to ever increasing production volumes.  This then lead to a new phenomenon of fast fashion, where ready made clothes could be purchased very quickly with little or no associated investment. Although these styles of dress were rapidly discarded when no longer needed, they continued to exert a powerful pull upon the global economy. Although fast fashion may have existed prior to the twentieth century, its significance was heightened by the invention of the radio and the cinema in the same century. 

The rise of mass media in the twentieth century is usually taken as the starting point for the development of fast fashion. It created an appetite for accessible styles of dress, which could be produced quickly and cheaply. Manufacturers produced fast fashion using ready made materials. This created demand for even quicker production, but also meant that the supply was less secure and styles were more ephemeral. It created a powerful pull upon the global economy. 

Whilst there is some truth to this, there are multiple influences upon fashion. Fashion has long had a cultural pull, which means that existing dress styles are developed for specific reasons such as social significance or utility. This means that whilst fast fashion may have existed"," At this time we see the rise of the shopkeeper or stall-holder who is also a tailor or corset-maker or milliner, who, through the application of knowledge derived from the study of textiles and the construction of clothes, can play a significant role in fashioning a new persona for the wearer.  Thus, it would be reasonable to assume that this tradition of tailors and corset-makers and milliners and the like would continue to the present day and indeed fashion houses still survive today. 

Here are some things to think about in response to this prompt: 
* Fashion as a phenomenon that has only recently come into existence, having a history dating back to early modern trade
* Fashion as something entirely dependent on capitalism - historians of fashion frequently point out that fashion is not dependent on the existence of a market or a capitalist. 
* Fashion as a modern phenomenon.  If historians of fashion take a longer view fashion may be something that has existed since the rise of textiles and the study of clothing.

This is what you would learn from a history of fashion lesson.


**The rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries**

There are several ways historians of fashion might trace the history of fashion.  One approach might trace the history of clothing, particularly the textiles trade which provided the knowledge required to apply to the wearer of the garment.  Fashion is"," The spread of trade and exchange across Europe resulted in a greater level of variation in dress and the creation of regional and national fashions. This rapid spread resulted in regional fashions also developing independently, which ultimately led to the rise of fashion as a modern concept. 

The prompt could be answered by providing a passage from a history book that provides evidence for the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

"," 

Fashion emerged in the early twentieth century as a result of changes in the needs and desires of women; it was initially fuelled by the growing desire of women to look stylish and fashionable. Fashion magazines and shows were also started at this time to showcase the latest trends. The rise of air travel meant that trends and styles could be disseminated around the world very quickly and in a very direct way. 

There are many traces of fashion in cultures around the world. In western culture we see influences from Ancient Egypt through to China and Rome. These cultures all had clothing that functioned as a way of separating the classes, from the wealthy, upper classes, to the very poor and common people. Fashion is now something that is a natural extension of who we are as humans. 

The ability for people to express themselves through their appearance has not only had a huge impact on how society views women, but it has also empowered women in all corners of the world to be able to achieve great things. 

Fashion is an art that is able to encompass many elements that can have an influence on our society, but is largely defined by the desire of woman for to express their individuality and to look the part.

  * Fashion is an art that expresses the individuality and looks the part. 
  * Fashion can be traced back to the early 20th century as a result of the growing desire of women to look stylish and fashionable. 
  * There are traces of fashion"," This brought artisans from all over Europe to the northern European countries, the largest group being the Low Countries and Northern France. As they brought their skill and knowledge in design, they helped to establish the European sense of fashion, and a great many fashions were soon established, although some would argue that even this definition is open to debate. 

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, artisans began to set up shops in the Northern European countries, including The Netherlands, where fashion became well established. As they became more established, they hired staff to help design and produce their goods. Over the course of the century, this meant that designers were able to receive detailed instructions from the shop floor and began to experiment with more innovative and creative designs.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, fashion began to shift from the North of Europe to Europe as a whole as more and more people began to enjoy the style and adapt their clothing to reflect this.  As industrialisation and urbanisation spread, so did fashion, and many people began to dress and adorn themselves according to the latest fashions, often leading to a rise in the number of clothes and tailors shops. This continued into the twentieth century, particularly with the advent of commercial aviation during the First World War, and was mirrored by a rise in women’s ability to dress independently to their own personal tastes. In the 1970s, modern hairstyles began to become more popular, leading to a large increase"," But there is also a significant development in the field of textile production that can be seen as critical to the modernisation of fashion. Textiles are a prime example of a thing made by humans for humans, yet at the same time a thing that has become central to human life in all its complexity. From the loom to the door frame, textiles are an integral part of all human settlements. This long history has resulted in a distinctive style known as the ""Fashion Style"" which is quite different to other styles of dress. Fashionable fashion in the modern sense of the word began to take shape in the latter half of the eighteenth century with the rise of the silhouette and the crinoline. 

Silhouettes: this is the body shape of a garment typically as measured by its length from hem to waist.  Silhouettes became more constrictive from top to bottom, with the result being that there is a distinct bottom half that would have been visible without the top half.  

Crinolines: this is a body garment made of stuffing to enhance its shape, first appearing on skirts in the latter half of the eighteenth century. 

Fashion's modern development in the latter half of the nineteenth century is often associated with the rise of the model and the silhouette became even more definitive. Textiles are an obvious choice for the consumer and manufacturers developed markets to sell their wares. The rise of mass-production of textiles and the"
" Curiosity got the better of them and they began to experiment and soon discovered that the shiny yellow pebble was the best bit of metal - and this was very exciting! It soon become clear that there was an unlimited supply of this metal - and they began to look for other shiny yellow pebbles to accumulate the most metal they could. Soon they were making weapons from bronze and then even more remarkable metals like gold and silver. These would become the main metals for people living around the world for many hundreds of years. 

The story should be around 5,000 words in length. Use the given information to develop your story. 

Bronze was discovered by chance, while the early humans were just idly standing around and watching a fish come by. 

They were then inspired to pick up the shiny yellow pebble that had caught their eye, and to try and pick it off the riverbed. And to their surprise and delight, they discovered that this shiny yellow pebble was actually the best bit of metal - and they began to accumulate as much of this metal as possible. 

And it didn't take long before they discovered that there was an unlimited supply of this metal, and soon they were making weapons from bronze, and soon still more remarkable metals like gold and silver. 

This was a really important discovery, because it meant that people now had a reliable source of fuel, and weapons that didn't just work, but were beautiful and exciting and"," Over the years the little yellow pebble became a pebble and then a rock and in due course of time it metamorphosed into a metal. 

The metals the early humans used were copper, bronze and gold. These are still with us today.


The story the child should write is based on an episode from the episode of the same name of the British science-fiction television series Doctor Who, first broadcast in 1963.


The child's story might go something like this:

I was sitting by the side of a river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idling away a moment one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. Over the years the little yellow pebble became a pebble and then a rock and in due course of time it metamorphosed into a metal. It could have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals.

Over the years the little yellow pebble became a pebble and then a rock and in due course of time it metamorphosed into a metal. It could have been a wish for self"," The hard, shiny surface drew his eye and he turned the pebble over in his hands. What would it have been like 4,000 years ago to be the first homo sapiens and to witness the advent of what has become second nature to us--a desire to fashion metal? 

The ancient person might well have been impressed by the skill with which the pebble had been worked, and by the way it had been shaped. He would not, however, have recognised it as being made of metal. Iron, gold, copper, silver and bronze were all discovered only within the last few centuries. It is unlikely that he would have thought much of the object's purpose: as an ornaments, to be polished and given as presents, or to be used to help him kill a mammoth; or as a tool, to assist in fish-spearing or in cutting meat; or as a weapon, to be hurled or thrown at a mammoth. 

Or he might have laughed at the idea that something so inert could ever be so useful.


These words could easily have been spoken by the early homo sapiens or someone else, say an astrolabe maker in the middle ages. Still, they are more or less historically accurate.


In fact, the earliest metal objects were discovered not in Europe but in the Americas, in Peru. The oldest of the metal ores ever mined was copper. But the first metals"," This would be a big break from the dull gray mud that made up the surrounding terrain. The discovery of this golden treasure would mark the beginning of a long, eventful journey which would eventually bring man to the point where he could fashion tools and weapons. At least that's what the storybook says. Write a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale using the following prompt:

The story should start with the first human contact with a metal, such as a shiny yellow pebble.  This is where you decide what happened to the first human to come across a shiny yellow pebble.  You may choose to have the first human contact the river bed or just sit by the side of the river.  At some point later in the story, the first human would discover that the shiny yellow pebble was a treasure.  The discovery of the treasure caused the first human to take the next step toward making tools and weapons.  This is when the story gets interesting.  You may decide that the first human had to wait for a fish to come within a spears throw or just idly happened upon the shiny yellow pebble, which is what started the journey that led to the making of tools and weapons.  Or, you may have another approach that says the story actually gets started with the discovery of the shiny yellow pebble, and it's the discovery of the shiny yellow pebble"," Over time that yellow pebble transformed into a needle, a sword, a sword hilt, a cannon piece and now a bus. Although man has been using metals for at least a thousand years he is yet to come up with an effective way to process or utilize the vast quantities of metals available. 
  
The following story is from the 'World Book' published by Random House in 2001.

 - Stone Age people saw shiny yellow pebbles lying around by the side of the river and gathered them up. Over time they began to hone those pebbles into needles, swords, swordshields and bows.  Eventually these adornments were used to hunt game, kill enemy predators and defend themselves. 

Today man has not been able to effectively process or utilize the vast quantities of metals available to him. He still sits by the side of the river waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw or idles by a pool ready to catch the next wave.

 - The story of metals is still with us today. We use them every day but they still have the ability to kill, maim and destroy. The idea of processing metals has not been mastered. Although man has been using them for many thousands of years it is still a search for a ""killer app"". One day perhaps we may use these qualities to find a way to effectively use the enormous quantities of metals that are currently available to us.

 - The story of the"," This a first step in the journey of discovery to understanding, that would set the scene for further development of metalworking and trading.

" I'd sit and stare at the city until I fell into a stupor, convinced that I could capture the beauty of the human condition with my lens. 
  Then one day, as I walked through the streets, I heard a man whisper urgently, ""Run, if you have any sense. Run for your life!"" At first, I thought he was nuts. A street Photographer? How absurd. And yet when he grabbed my arm and hissed in my ear, ""That man, there, he is a Nazi! Run!"" I felt my knees give way and almost fell. I couldn't stop to examine my reaction. I was off to the side of the street and didn't want to get in his way. I was paralyzed. What was I going to do? I couldn't run in my shoes, let alone in my bare feet. And then, in that moment, I had a revelation. The first step, I realized, might not be my own. My friend's life was in my hands, and I had to act. I turned and sprinted in the direction of his voice. It was dark, but I could sense him close behind. As I passed the man in the Hitler suit, he grabbed me and dragged me into a nearby pub, where a barmaid spotted me in his lap and he was instantly booted out. I was surrounded by Germans, most of them hostile, and I had no idea how to explain my situation. "," 

Photography was one of my passions. I was especially fond of black and white film, which gave the image sharpness in the dark spaces between the grains of the negative. At least when the image was developed by a specialist laboratory. 

I found a dark, anonymous neighborhood to sit in, and set about getting my equipment fixed. It was late afternoon by the time I had the film and lenses in working order.

With everything in hand, I ventured off, wandering aimlessly about the city. What a delight that the sun was shining. It was beautiful light, the way the colors bathed the world. Even the city came to life. It was exciting and I felt alive. 

By late evening, I decided to return to my hotel. I had an appointment the following morning. I was exhausted, and needed to get some rest.

I found my hotel, and settled into my room. It was quiet. No radio to drown out the sound of my own thoughts. No television to keep me occupied while I waited for my appointment. 

It was too late to go to sleep. So, I did something I never do. I went looking for something to do. A drink. And to kill the time. 

I walked down the street, and was quite taken by what I saw. In a dark corner a group was gathered around a small table. One person was lighting a cigarette, and another was peeling an apple"," And in Vienna there was so much to observe.

I walked through the old town, the old part of the old town that was still the old town, not the new. There are still a few remnants of its old structure left. Old buildings with old inhabitants. You have to admit, it was interesting, and I had to remind myself why I was there and why I should be happy and not resentful about it. It was my last chance to find the old town on my own, to walk without a guide. 

I soon decided to get one. I needed to hire a guide for the remainder of the trip. It was late and I didn't want to wait. I couldn't. A hotel clerk suggested I find the Wiener Werkstatt museum, and there I got my guide. A handsome man in his forties led me to the spot I had in my head. The light, how it reflected on the glass case filled with precious objects from the 19th century. Everything was crystal and glass and silver and gold and it didn't matter how old it was. 

The man looked at me over the top of his rimless glasses. He was used to tourists. His gaze was cool and he knew how to handle them. ""You will like it here,"" he said, and I agreed.

And I did. I had never experienced such calmness and peace. I felt it as soon as we stepped out of the hotel."," The way colors moved on a page—this, too, had its mysteries. But mostly my heart was in the world of words. These were people, the people of Vienna. To me, their lives seemed so full, so rich, so deep. I wondered what it would feel like to spend one’s life with so many friends and relatives. I wanted to know the secrets of their lives. I longed to be a part of their stories. And then the assignment arrived. The assignment was Vienna. 
  Vienna, Austria. I was about to see the world’s most famous city through the eyes of a foreigner for the first time. I wondered if I had it in me. If I could endure the harsh Vienna winter. And if I could live up to the Vienna assignment, to become an insider. The assignment seemed challenging. To wander through the streets of Vienna in the cold and snow seemed impossible. But I did it. And the experience changed my perception of the city forever. Vienna was no longer a cosmopolitan center of excellence where the world came to shop. I saw a dark alley. I heard angry words. I saw people living on the streets. 
  The assignment did have one redeeming feature: I did become friends with the concierge who invited me to their soirée and who later showed me her apartment. And I did get a glimpse of the city beyond the assignment: a glimpse of a people, a glimpse of a"," How old this city looked from a certain angle. How this view may have transformed through the seasons. Who lived here then? Who now? Did anyone care? I did care, and so did the tourists. Some of them were very enthusiastic, eager to get the shot. It was like one big game of capture the flag. Some were far more interested in making faces than in capturing the city as I knew it. What a joke, I thought, we can only truly see half of this city! But I was in a hurry, and I didn't slow down. And I didn't look. I was busy taking pictures of everything but Vienna. 

The following is an excerpt from the story ""Vienna"" written by Ansel Adams.

Vienna looked as old then as it does now, but at that time, in 1914, it seemed as new as yesterday. The buildings seemed fresh, clean, well-cared-for. But the tourists had taken over. I saw the city only when I stopped to observe the activity about me. No one was paying attention to the buildings and no one was looking at the windows, waiting. Not even a child playing with its father was unaware of the scene going on all about them. They were as caught up in the game of capturing the moment as the adults. As for me, I was only taking pictures. My camera wasn't that good yet. It had taken many shots of the city and of the tourists."," I'd seen things that no one else had seen. I knew there were people who were important to me, but I was never able to get a firm fix on their locations and faces. Now I was somewhere in Vienna, but I had no idea why. I'd been wandering for some time, lost in my thoughts. The sound of the photographer's shutter releasing brought me back to the moment, and I stopped to watch.

Here is an excerpt from the text: 

The sound of the photographer's shutter releasing brought me back to the moment, and I stopped to watch. The scene before me was extraordinary. I was standing on the corner of a quiet side street, watching as a parade of old men made their way down the street. Each carried a heavy piece of furniture, either empty or covered by a tarpaulin. There must have been at least a hundred of them, moving slowly past me in the late afternoon sun, heading for the docks.


The number of words in the text is in the 10's, with a total of 35 words:

Ten words per sentence = 35"," I wanted to know what the world looked like from every angle. And so I went to the museums and spent hours in galleries, gazing at works of art. Many were too grand and expensive for me to own. I had to settle for copying them in photographs. After all, that was my only form of currency. One day in particular, I was especially eager to get a photograph of a painting in the Vienna Museum called ""The Death of Marat."" I walked from the front to the back of the building, passing the columns of the monument to the late French revolutionist. As I reached the back of the building, I saw a glass door marked EXPLORATORIUM and wondered if I might have the chance to enter. My heart beat faster as I waited for the security guard to open the door. When he finally did, I pushed through the opening. He looked up and down. ""No one allowed inside!"" he said. ""I just let you in,"" I countered. He did not understand a thing. I could tell by his expression that he did not believe a word. There was another door ahead, marked PRIVATE. I pushed it open, and there was indeed a guard behind it. I pointed at the painting I was so eager to get a photograph of. The guard nodded and stepped out of the way. He motioned me to come inside. ""It's on the other side,"" he said. ""You'll need to go upstairs."" I"
" However as a personal experience I would strongly disagree that enough sleep is the modern condition. In school I was a regular offender of getting in on the last bus from school to my grandparents, having an alarm to wake me at 6am was a luxury afforded to me only by my parents. As a child I used to stare at the clock for hours counting the minutes until my alarm went off, I spent much of Saturday morning laying in bed thinking about all the things I needed to do that weekend. After university I was plagued with night terrors. It was only after my first ever proper prescription did I realise that this was a side effect of my anti-depressants. Since starting the medication my sleep has improved immeasurably; waking up refreshed and eager to tackle my days and so have not reached the point where my ability to function drops despite ample sleep. My point being, not only is adequate sleep necessary for health, it can actually make you more productive. 
Do you agree with the above or disagree? Why? 

In my experience not only is adequate sleep necessary for health, it can actually make you more productive. In my case I was diagnosed with insomnia as a child, and yet by the time I was older a prescription had made it possible for me to get at least 8 hours of sleep per night. After university, I was plagued with night terrors. It was only after taking my first anti-depressant that this side effect became apparent,"," It is widely claimed, however, that insufficient sleep has a negative effect on the human body and brain as well as causing obesity, diabetes, depression and immune-system collapse. Some ancient civilisations such as the Mayans, Indians, Aztecs and Incas have left us written evidence of how they addressed the problem of sleeplessness and how they came to terms with it. 

The following are several ancient cultures that have evidence of how to deal with sleeplessness. 

In ancient Babylon, there is evidence of an Ancient Babylonian method to help cure sleeplessness - the ancient Babylonian gods Marduk and Bel-Marduk would give the person suffering from sleeplessness a golden bowl and a rope, allowing the person to hang the bowl from a rope and swing from side to side, while swinging would help the person fall asleep. 

Ancient China used the phrase 'Drink tea, it will refresh you' (for people to drink tea) when suffering from sleeplessness.

In ancient Rome, the poet Lucilius of Samosata claimed there was nothing worse than not being able to sleep and suffering the same night after night. He suggested that those suffering from that plight could relieve the anxiety by using an ancient remedy based on a small fish which lived in the sea near Rome. They would put the fish into the water bowl of the sufferer and close the lid and the sufferer would","  Are there any facts to support this claim of sleeplessness becoming the modern condition?  

Firstly it must be considered the definition of ""tiredness"".  This is a subjective feeling.  That said, it is one that we are all likely to experience from time to time.  An adult, who has never worked in factories, farms or similar, would likely never consider themselves ""tired"" because of the variety of jobs available today.  Someone working as a taxi driver, construction worker, nurse or truck driver likely feels ""tired"" at different times.  It is certainly very possible to be ""tired"" and yet lead an active, healthy life. 
Furthermore, ""sleep deprivation"" is also widely considered detrimental to physical and mental health. It can lead to memory loss, poor decision-making, and even increase the likelihood of mental illnesses like depression and suicide.  These are all factors which are considered before determining that insufficient ""sleep"" has become the ""modern condition"". 

In summary there is no hard evidence for the claim that sleep deprivation has become the modern condition.  It has been used by the media to sensationalise stories of poor mental health caused by lack of sleep.  A better approach would be to support people who work or live with sleep deprivation by researching effective treatments and lifestyle changes.  There is no one right way to live your life, and perhaps this attitude towards ""tiredness"" is an example"," But is enough sleep really necessary? Could it even be unhealthy to over sleep?

Your main character is chronically tired, falling asleep at work, experiencing nightmares and losing friends and family as a result. The author suggests the condition of being tired may be more a choice than a lack of opportunity for rest. The protagonist eventually tries to find a healthy sleep regimen and changes her daily schedule in order to sleep at night rather than staying up too late or going to bed too early. She also tries meditation and relaxation techniques to help herself sleep, finding a hobby that helps her to focus on something other than sleep. By making changes to her evening and nighttime activities she is able to get a full night's sleep and experience the positive benefits.


Here is an extract that might be suitable for your story:

The night was long. A dark shadow crept across the lawn, and she bolted upright, gasping as a great bat, huge as a child, swept over the patch of darkness.

She lay there, panting, while outside, the sounds of the forest returned to her. The birdsong was faint, and the wind carried the noise of the trees across the lawn. But she could still make out the calls of the night creatures - the rustle of leaves, the hoot of a red-tailed hawk, the croak of a black stork. She lay there listening to it all, and then she fell asleep once more.

"," This talk will explore whether ‘tiredness’ has become the modern condition, and the issues of sleep deprivation and insomniacism in fiction.

The prompt could be:

Too much sleep or not enough sleep? Tiredness is often claimed to have become the modern condition. The research of 40 million Americans with chronically bad sleep has found that many are unable to sleep properly. In addition, the best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings. This talk will explore whether “tiredness” has become the modern condition and the issues of sleep deprivation and insomniacism in fiction.

Write a 2-3 page summary of this research which draws on the following sources:

40 million Americans with chronically bad sleep (source 1)

The best-selling novels in Britain (source 2)

The research on which this topic was explored (source 3)

The CEFR scale (source 4)

Your own knowledge of the current sleep situation in the USA and the UK (sources 5 and 6)

The following is a first draft of a possible summary of this topic:

Recent research has found that 40 million Americans have chronic sleep deprivation. This affects everything from memory to motivation. In addition to this, the best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings"," In a world of over-connectivity this has led to a world of ‘wired but not high-tech’. 
Some have claimed that as technology has grown ‘user-friendly’ (to put it in consumer-ese) so our need for sleep has diminished. The same is said of the rise of video games, laptops, smartphones, tablets. We ‘aren’t meant to be awake’ is a popular claim – though I’m not sure how true it is in every case. But if it has become so much more fashionable not to be awake surely that is a sign of progress. And when you consider the ‘sleep debt’ built up during our youth by a lack of sleep it could be seen as a salutary sign we are now more self-disciplined as a result and will be ‘better citizens’ for having had that sleep. 
It’s not the case that everyone is insomniac today and it’s not insomniacs who feature as protagonists in best-selling novels. The argument would be much stronger if recent research into our sleep schedules found that sleep has been steadily eroded. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists or sleep-research laboratories as their settings. It’s an argument for a sleep-deprived world, which I hope is hyperbole, not the case.","  But many modern humans are getting deeper and deeper sleepless nights every night.  Doctors in the UK have recently warned of a ‘silent epidemic’ of sleep deprivation.  It is recommended to get at least 7-9 hours’ sleep a night. But many are now working night shifts, long hours on computers and smartphones and the demands of modern living. 

Sleep, a vital need for human beings, has been subject to a lot of critical thinking and has been shown to benefit health and productivity. Yet sleepless nights can lead to both physical and mental fatigue. 

Modern life has forced many to give up sleeping habits they once had, with some turning to insomnia, a disorder involving recurrent bouts of sleep disruption. 

Chronic insomnia can have far reaching effects on an individual’s mental and physical health, from headaches, mood swings, low energy levels and cognitive impairment to obesity and heart disease. It can even impact fertility, immunity, metabolism and growth.   

Modern life requires longer hours for work, longer driving times to visit friends and family, and often working shifts that extend into the night. 

With so much to accomplish, it’s easy to find it difficult to wind down at night. But with enough sleep, one can perform better and be more energetic during the day. 

With this in mind, many have started taking sleep supplements. 

With limited or no side-effects, the demand for these is growing"
" As a result, employees are turning up in warmer clothing and asking each other if it is really worth it.

Your story should highlight the conflicted feelings amongst staff who would otherwise be enjoying the warmer weather. The theme is the debate on the worth of air-conditioning in a climate neutral to zero carbon world.

General tips for writing a compelling story:

Start your story with a relevant scene which will make an impact on your readers. In this case, employees are turning up to work in warmer clothing. This gives you the opportunity to introduce an element of debate, showing a split in opinion within the company. 

Using dialogue helps give your story a sense of realism. Here, the air-conditioner can be described as a “he”. You can use some of the below dialogue: “He cut him off. He said it was no big deal. He just prefers the cold. I told him to suck it up and wear the warmer clothing. But he looked a bit peeved”, etc.

Use descriptive language to paint a vivid picture for your readers: “The chill in the air… employees in warmer clothing”. Avoid using generic words and phrases such as ‘it seems’ and use active voice to make your descriptions more vivid. 

Use interesting characters to give your story depth. It is clear the air-conditioner has caused a rift within the company with employees arguing about whether it is worth the expense. We learn a lot"," At the moment, however, there is no Arctic summer, so Cannons Gym is struggling to cope. Staff have complained and there are rumours that the council will be cutting funding unless something is done quickly. The problem, as the staff see it, is that the air-con in the gym simply isn’t strong enough. The company that runs the gym, Efficient Electric, is unlikely to stand in the way of government funding for air-con. After all, who could afford to have a gym with an inadequate air-con system? 

Solution: Efficient Electric installs air-conditioning units of double the required size in the gym. Staff approve. 

The story makes sense, even if it does gloss over some of the complexities of running a gym with air-con.

","  

This is a good story for City of London workers to read. The story describes how the air conditioning has been turned up to the point where the gym feels like it is in the Arctic.  

Air conditioning is a very big deal in London, and many people work in the City.  The story could be set in London where the City of London, where trading companies and financial institutions are headquartered, or the author could use examples from other places in London where air conditioning is important.  

The story starts with the narrator describing the chill in the air, and then details how the air conditioning is now so powerful it feels as if the narrator is in the Arctic.  


The air conditioning has been turned up to the point where the gym feels like it is in the Arctic.


The story then focuses on the idea of going overboard, or to excess.  It describes the fitness centre installing new air conditioning units which were much more powerful than needed.  It turns out that not only is the air conditioning overbearing, it is also causing people to feel disoriented, and perhaps even suffer from heat stroke.  


To make matters worse, the fitness centre was not well-equipped to deal with a failure of any of the equipment and had no plans for such an eventuality.  It turns out that the fitness centre’s infrastructure was not well-suited to deal with a large number of computers and other pieces"," Fortunately, the chill doesn’t seem to show on the backs of the gym members as they workout on the free weights, the cardio equipment and on the basketball court. So far so good but as the hours pass and the workers become more dehydrated, their aggression rises.


The best way to approach writing a story for Grade 2 learners is to start with a plot, characters, setting and dialogue. If your story involves a gym then a plot might go something like this: A group of workers at a fitness centre decide to open up a rival gym in an effort to drive down the prices of membership. There is tension in the air as the workers become more aggressive towards each other because of the heat, the gym equipment doesn’t work properly and the workers become more dehydrated.


The plot elements you can use when writing for Grade 2 learners include: a group of people doing something, tension in the air, equipment not working and people becoming dehydrated. You could also use the characters, setting and dialogue listed below.

Characters:

- The workers at the fitness centre

- The rivals who want to set up a rival gym

Setting:

- A fitness centre

- The sky

Dialogue:

- “We need to lower the prices and drive down memberships”

- “Agreed”

- “It’s not working properly”

- “Not on the free weights,"," A few years ago there were rumours that the owners of Cannons Gym, a company known for their extreme aversion to innovation, were considering installing an Olympic-sized swimming pool next to the gym but these reports were never really investigated and now seem like little more than urban myth. One is therefore left wondering what the owners of Cannons Gym might have planned for the latest in personal cooling technology. One thing is certain; even at peak summer temperatures this building will remain as cold as the outside.

"," The problem is, the chill in the air is in fact the chill in the text. The problem has nothing to do with the text, or air-con for that matter, the problem is that there are way to few words. For example, there are only 6 words in the sentence “City workers headed for lunch.” The short sentence means there are way too many words. A similar problem is found in the text’s total syllables. There are over 30 syllables in the text – and this is for only a 7-page book. The text in total contains way too many words and way too many syllables. In short, the text is dense. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for this text is 72. This means the words in the text are more closely packed together than words in more simple text.  

You could argue that this is subjective and based on what is considered simple or not simple by the person doing the assessment. You could also argue that this text contains so many words because it is an interesting book that should be consumed in one go. 

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level only has a small amount of data to work with so there are going to be some assumptions and judgements being made here. For instance, it’s reasonable to assume that simple text is going to be contained in words or sentences of fewer than 15 words. And this text is clearly not simple as it contains more than 30 words"," 

The gym is being awfully efficient with the air conditioning, it is like a freezer at lunch time. The noise levels are absurd!

A:

Air-conditioning There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer’s unusually high temperatures the fitness center has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so in fact that at quiet times the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic.

The gym is being awfully efficient with the air conditioning, it is like a freezer at lunch time. The noise levels are absurd!

There's something a bit odd about this passage. There is no information about the temperature in the passage, so I can't discern whether the passage is describing winter or summer or whatnot. But there is no sense of place in this passage. What gym and what chill? What ""lunch time"" and where does the Arctic come into it? I'm not sure what's going"
" I was alone for a moment, fumbling to find the light switch and then, once I had switched it on, I struggled to find a comfortable position so that I could see, when I could see. But I couldn't see. The bucket was not deep enough. I tried to think of what to do. Should I climb down again? You would never forgive me if I died of embarrassment! There was only one solution. I had to find a way to widen the bucket. 
  My mind began to work quickly. If I cut the rope with my knife it should drop down faster and make it easier to climb out. I started by sawing away at the rope near where you looped it over the bucket. It didn't take long before the rope was in two pieces. I quickly cut the remainder and then, climbing out again, used the rope as a slingshot to launch the bucket. To my relief, the rope had made the bucket weigh more so that I could climb out quickly. When I had emerged I had only a few cuts on my hands and knees, but I was exhausted. I sat down on the grass to recover. But when I had recovered enough to stand I discovered something quite surprising. I could no longer see the stars. The stars I could see had gone dark. 
  I was very worried. What if I had damaged my eyesight in some way? I had no way of proving to you that I was truly blind without","  I peered down into the black hole, my heart in my mouth. The stars were visible. I could see the Milky Way, and there, way off to the left, was the Small Magellanic Cloud, the only other known galaxy belonging to a different galaxy.  

The story is about a person and a bucket that are in a well, trying to see the stars, but worry about the well potentially caving in.


#### Right. The above text is a story designed to be read by Grade 2 learners. It contains the following main elements: 

- A person (who is described using simple words)
- A bucket (which is not particularly exciting)
- A well (which is interesting)
- A plan: the person attempts to see the stars from a sufficiently deep well hole, and then worries about falling into the well.


There is not too much to say about the text as it is fairly straight-forward, and the grammar is fine.


The text contains some interesting ideas for an adventure: going into a deep well, trying to see the stars, and then finding out there is more than one galaxy.


There is one minor grammatical issue, which is a misplaced comma: ""I could see the""


The text contains a few interesting images: a well with a bucket in it, the Milky Way, and the Small Magellanic Cloud.


#### One grammatical issue that stands out"," The bucket was big enough for both of us and there was enough air in it for both of us. It was very dark at first, but after a while I could see the lights of Sydney far away in the distance. I looked around at the strange noises and felt around for the rope which I had placed on the bottom of the bucket before we began our climb. I was very relieved to find it on the bottom of the bucket. I clung on to the rope as I had done many times before and began to pull myself upwards. I felt myself slipping for a moment and then the rope broke, I fell back into the darkness of the well and banged my head on the bottom. I was very frightened, but managed to stop myself from crying until the next day when I convinced myself that I was going to be OK. You must have been so disappointed. I thought about it all night and next day when I woke up, and realised that it hadn’t been a waste, I had learned a lot about the stars, I had seen a bit of Sydney, and I was alone in a well.

I am sure you could make up a similar story, provided you had climbed down into a sufficiently deep hole after wining a heavy bucket up the well wall. You could further explain that you had convinced me to climb down into the well to begin with, by pretending to show me the ropes you had hidden down the well. But in the"," I pulled the pulley handle until I could see the sky above the trees. We'd been down in the well for a few minutes and the stars were already coming into view; my excitement rose. ""Look Dad, there's Orion, it's like a map,"" I said, pointing at the constellation to your right. As I watched, Orion's sword cut the darkness as it slowly moved across the sky. Then my eye was caught by something brighter, and closer. As I stared into the distance, the new star rose, brighter still. My heart skipped a beat. ""Dad, it's coming out of Orion's belt! Orion's belt is behind that cloud!"" I said, pointing to the left. The first star was still hidden from view behind the cloud. I strained to see it through the glass. I had to get to the roof. ""Dad, I'm going to climb out the window. You have to catch me."" I clambered out and, as I leaned against the well to steady myself, I saw the first star and screamed.

What was the first star? Was it a small, faint star or a large, bright one? Was it close or far away?

  * The first star was Orion's Belt, a beautiful constellation seen from low-lying areas such as wells. It is made up of approximately 70 stars arranged in a circle around a bright, prominent star at its centre.

  *"," I peered out into the darkness, a hundred metres below and hoped that at least the Milky Way was visible, but all I could see was the pale glow of the streetlights outside, shining into the hole. But then there it was, just out of my reach, a soft pink smear that moved from side to side.  I reached for it, but my hand went straight through.
""What the heck are you doing?""
""Looking at the stars.""
""Well you'll just get yourself hurt.""
""So will falling to my death.""
""Don't tempt fate."" And so saying, I pushed the prongs at a diagonal across the bottom of the bucket. The bucket gave a solid shudder and I braced myself.
""AAAAGH!""
And then the stars burst through into the room. The bucket came off the wall with a loud thump and I slid down the side, my head knocking against the metal ring that joined the sides of the bucket. I clung on to the sides of the bucket as it fell with a thump and then with a splash and rumble disappeared from view.  
I let out a whoop, but the only answer was from deep down inside the bucket.
""Hello?""
And then I heard a splash and the thump of something hitting the bottom of the bucket.
""You all right down there?""
""AAAAGH!""
And then from far below:
""AAAAGH!"""," You were so quiet I nearly said something to keep you quiet: I was about to remind you not to fall asleep when the well bucket seemed to shudder and sink. You spluttered, mouth dry. 'Let go,' I said, 'it will be okay.' You didn't answer. I twisted back to look up, and there was nothing; the bucket had disappeared.

I peered through the small window as the bucket was hoisted to the lip of the well. You were right; the sky was dark, more of a grey than blue, although as I looked closer I saw some specks of light. “They must be the stars,” I said, “I can see the Orion’s belt.” “They can’t be Orion’s belt, it’s below the horizon now,” you said as I craned my neck to look past you. You are right, but I’m not interested in facts, I just want to hear your voice again and see the stars through your eyes. “What if you’re wrong?” you asked. “Well then you’ll have to save your guess for a special occasion,” I said with a grin. I leaned forward and gave you a big wet kiss, and then we started to hear a noise. I turned to look at the well bucket and realised the rope holding it in the well was unravelling.

He stepped into the lounge and the darkness was amplified tenfold by the overhead light. This way of living was what he had signed up for after losing his job and the car and house he had grown accustomed to. He had also signed up for the fact that his new room-mate was a huge cunt.
He found his room-mate leaning against the dresser and slamming his fist down on top of it. He appeared very angry. Ralph stood in the doorway and said, ""I'm sorry, I'll put your bag in the room.""

There was silence. Finally Ralph asked, ""Did I wake you up?""
""No"" came the curt reply.
Ralph cleared his throat. ""Are you okay?""
The room-mate turned and stared at Ralph for a moment, then a sad smile slowly spread across his face. He nodded, then went back to beating the dresser.
Ralph decided to leave him be for now and went back to his room. It had always bothered him how much the room-mate disliked him, but now he understood why. Ralph had been oblivious to it for three years, but now that he was being genuinelyfriendworthy, the room-mate was disappointed in him.
His friendlessness had always been a source of pain to Ralph, but now, in his room-mate's eyes, he was no better than the people he disliked the most. Ralph understood the sentiment and was","  Ralph breathed a sigh of relief as he entered the house and took in the scene. The house was quiet but for the low murmur of his wife in the kitchen. He walked down the hall to their bedroom, the same room they had occupied since they were married three years before and closed the door behind him.

Ralph walked into their bedroom and flicked on the light, a smile spreading across his face. He leaned over and kissed his wife, who returned his kiss.

“I’ve been doing some research on how to build muscle mass,” said Ralph to his wife.

“Good idea,” said his wife.

“And I came across this website called “Diet Coke and Donuts” which recommends that you ingest large quantities of Diet Coke and donuts in order to gain muscle mass,” continued Ralph.

“You’re telling me you’re going to eat a whole box of donuts just to gain muscle mass?” asked his wife, clearly concerned.

“Not necessarily a whole box of donuts,” replied Ralph. “But it’s the principle of the idea. I need to put on some muscle mass so I’m going to get bigger.”

“Okay Ralph, but I’m worried about all of the sugar you’ll be consuming,” responded his wife.

“Don’t worry baby, I’ll only drink one soft drink and eat one don","  

He took one slow step into the hall and the hairs on the back of his neck stiffened.  What lay on the floor in the center of the hall?  Was there something moving?  His eyes slowly adjusted to the gloom and he made out that the center of the hall was indeed, still, and quiet. 
He stepped further into the hall and his gaze travelled over the walls.  What was on the wall in front of him?  A book on ornithology.   There was a picture of a black bird in a tree, but it wasn't a black bird.  It was a crow.   

His eyes then returned to the center of the hall.

He froze when his gaze met that of the figure in the center of the hall.

He slowly backed out of the hall and hurried down the corridor until he reached the entrance of the stairs.  He made it to the bottom of the stairs but wasn't able to flee back to the first floor.  

He stood rooted to the spot.

He wanted to see who was there.  Who were they?  What were they doing here?  

He slowly took another step into the hall and the figure stepped out from the shadows.

Two hooded figures materialized out of the darkness.  One held a large sickle in his right hand and the other held a curved blade.  Both started towards Ralph. 

"," The walls were lined with numerous portraits of deceased members of the family and other notable personages past and present. Ralph noticed a man in a tuxedo standing next to the staircase, and walked over to him.

""Good evening Sir, I've been expecting you, can I get you to join me in a drink?"" the man extended a gloved hand to him.

The man accepted the offer with some reluctance, ""Thank you Sir, but I don't think I'm up to it at the moment.""

The man seemed unduly concerned about his health, ""That's quite alright, I understand if you simply must be careful."" He stepped closer, ""The air up here can be trying at times, it might be just what you need."" He removed his glove and held out his hand, but Ralph recoiled, ""Please sir, I would prefer not to..."" He turned to walk away, only to have the man grab his shoulder hard and shake it furiously.

""Listen you silly boy, this is how these events are transpired and how we must all face our end,"" the man's grip was now uncomfortably tight around his shoulder.

Ralph was about to shake off his captor and run downstairs to escape the situation, but noticed a large crystal vase on the table just by him, its crystal swirling in a hypnotic pattern. A sudden wave of calm overtook him and he stepped toward the v"," The sound of breathing assured him all was well. The large hall which housed several offices to front and back was well lit by large floor to ceiling windows. To his right and left were large open plan rooms with whiteboards and pens, computer screens and data analysis equipment. He was surprised to see so many empty desks but this surprised him even more when he saw that there were no people in the hall. The silence was surreal and he paused, then cautiously stepped further into the hall. A small light glowed softly in one of the rooms on his left, the office of one of the directors of the company that Ralph worked for. He walked slowly towards it, his curiosity piqued. He found himself in the doorway of the office staring into the darkness, the only light coming from a desk lamp. His eyes adjusted to the dim light he saw that the room was unoccupied, nothing but a desk and chair with a laptop computer in front of the desk. He tiptoed towards the desk and looked on the screen. The laptop was open and the monitor displayed a spreadsheet filled with what looked like formulas and equations. At first glance Ralph was uninterested in what he was looking at but as he began to examine it more closely he became captivated by the equations and formulae which were written in mathematical notation that he did not recognise. He moved closer to the screen, curious, and reached out to touch the keyboard but stopped just short, his hand hovering over the keyboard. He","  
The first thing he noticed was the dark green carpet under his feet.  The walls were a soft, cream colour which the large family portraits displayed across the hallway with such reverence and care. Ralph didn’t remember the house from when he was a boy but he did recall the portraits and the name of the family on the first title page.  Mr and Mrs Knight, he remembered that much.  
The hall was silent.  He shone his phone light around the room and saw it was equally dark although he could see a sliver of the staircase to his right.  The staircase was missing a tread, a big gap where the second floor should have been.  There was another doorway down the hall, further down the right-hand side.  This was unoccupied.  
He flicked his light over the dark parquet floor and saw a faint indent in the middle of the hall where someone had slept.  This was no stranger, more a guest with a reservation on a flight out of New York but Ralph would certainly try and claim their bed in the spare room.
His eyes returned to the empty doorway and he stepped towards it, placing his hand on the doorjamb, feeling for the door.  He turned the doorknob but the door didn’t budge.  “Nnnnn...”  
He tried again.  It still didn’t move.  This couldn’t be right.  He peered at"," He'd not been home long when the house erupted into chaos as his young son ran in, out of breath, shouting, ""DADDY! DADDY!"". Ralph rushed to his son, who, after a short hiatus from play, had fallen from the top of a small wooden ladder to the basement floor, completely missing his trajectory and plummeting head-first. He laid him gently on the floor, cradling him in his arms as he felt for a pulse. ""It's not a heart attack,"" he thought, ""he's 15 years old - it's more likely accidental."" He turned to check that no one was looking and quickly looked away, feeling self-conscious and guilty. He pulled out his wallet from the back pocket of his jeans, searched for his medic alert bracelet and snapped it on. Then he turned to his son again, ""You okay?"" he asked. ""No, Dad, I'm in deep shit. I'm dead. My leg's broken."" The boy's words cut through Ralph's already dented confidence, and at that moment he noticed the leg was indeed broken. His heart dropped, and without thinking, without a moment's pause for consideration, he said, ""Okay, you're dead."" His son looked up at him in absolute disbelief. ""Dead?"" he echoed. ""Yeah, I'm dead,"" Ralph replied. 

After some initial shock, the boy responded, ""When did it happen?"". """
" The reason we hold such strong ties with the past is because we have access to a large part of it. This is evident in that we can easily access and access vast amounts of historical data about our ancestors. Additionally, we have the ability to record history in our social media, blogs, wikipedia and other online databases. There is so much data about our ancestors and it is freely accessible and free to use. Furthermore, we have the internet and the capacity to find people with similar backgrounds and interests and connect with them across the web. The result is that we have a shared knowledge of the past and this shared knowledge allows us to connect and feel connected to the past in meaningful ways.


Heritage allows us to connect to our ancestors in ways that are meaningful to us. Through Heritage we can learn about our own family and understand where we come from, what we owe to ancestors and how we can repay them. We can connect to our ancestors and feel a part of the community they lived in, and can feel part of a shared knowledge of the past. Heritage also allows us to feel a sense of connected to the broader community, a sense of belonging to a broader social group.


Therefore, Heritage is an important concept in today's society as it allows for deeper connections to our past. A deeper understanding of our past allows for a richer understanding of the present, as we can relate to it, and thus relate to the past and feel connected to the broader community. Thus,"," While we can think about our personal heritage only we are missing out on the connection to the wider community and the nation as a whole.

  * A grandmother tells her two grandsons about the old times when they used to go swimming in a nearby river. One of the grandsons ask her why they used to have to go out of the village to get to the river. She tells him that the nearby river is a heritage of the village, that all people in the village has a right to get to the river by the same path and no one wants to build new paths and instead all they do is destroy existing paths, so if anyone wants to get to the river now they have to go a long way out of the village. Her grandson then ask her what the village was called before they used to have to go that far out of the village to get to the river. She say it was called ""old village"" and that the people in the village before had built a new village ""modern village"" and everyone was moved to the ""old village"" and now it is a heritage of the people of the village.

  * Heritage is so important and I bet most people have a good connection to their heritage. In fact it is so important that we can't just think about our own personal heritage, we need to also connect to the community and the nation as a whole. One way to do that is by going back in history and listening to old people and how","  

What is important to remember is that our heritage is not confined to the past.  It is present in the present through places, buildings, artifacts and even names which tell us a lot about past communities who once lived and thrived there. 

The challenge we face today in ensuring our heritage is looked after and passed on to future generations is that we are seeing a lot of these places come under threat mainly because of development.  Development can be both a curse and a blessing depending on how it is developed and who it benefits.  If it benefits a particular group or community who are then left with little choice but to fight to save their heritage.  They will do this by trying to protect what they have as a matter of principle and a duty to the community they come from.  

There is always the argument that if development is allowed to go ahead the jobs and income will generate the money to continue the preservation of the heritage or in some cases the development will take place without the heritage and we will get lost in time again.  These arguments and many more are discussed in this week's Heritage  the magazine.

Ask your students to look at the picture of the heritage site in Sri Lanka, they may have never visited such a place before.  Ask them to read the article with the questions they then have. 

Do you think heritage gives us a sense of connection to the past?
What does it mean to us today?
What challenges"," But we tend not to connect with heritage that comes from a different time and culture. This is why it is important that we preserve and celebrate what is heritage so that people of today can understand and connect to the past and the stories that come with it. 

Heritage can be defined as the past of human civilization. It contains the accumulated knowledge and creative achievements of people from diverse communities living at different times and in different places. Heritage helps us understand the patterns of human behavior, their creativity and the forces that shaped human societies. It tells us where we came from, who we are and where we are heading. It is the legacy that we leave behind, the impact that we have on future generations, their lives and the impact that will continue well after we are gone. 

So when we talk about heritage we are talking about a sense of connection to the past. Heritage makes us feel part of a community that lives a common past and future. And this feeling of belonging gives us a sense of purpose. Heritage also brings us hope for a brighter future for our children and for our children's children.

The prompt continues with a list of some well known and historically significant places around the world. The reader is asked to write a text that would describe the role and importance of heritage in these places.

Place of origin:

Spain

Persons:

Cristobal Colón, Ferdinando Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci.

"," For communities that are still largely made up of smallholder farmers in the rural areas and they depend heavily on the local food system which is mainly based on family farming. Heritage helps them to be reminded of and find comfort in the knowledge that they are still connected to the past through food security and the social and cultural meaning they give to it. 

Heritage gives people and communities a sense of belonging and a feeling of connectedness to the past. As you might know people in communities do not grow enough food themselves to feed themselves and their families. Heritage provides a source of food security and cultural recognition. Often these people might not have had much education, they might be illiterate, but by telling them about how they used to live and why it is important they are able to connect with them and feel some sort of sense of pride. 

I am not sure how to write a story using this prompt.

Please note that this is a reading prompt. Your story should reflect the written prompt","  

However, the true sense of heritage is that it gives everyone a real sense of connection to the past and it is that connection which shapes the way we view life today and where we look to the future.  Heritage is not about owning priceless artefacts or having a large number of pictures hanging on your wall it is about the stories that are told and the people that you meet who are connected to the past and that gives them hope for the future.  

Heritage is about how our history informs our lives today.  

Heritage, in today's world is not just about old buildings and artefacts, it is about understanding and sharing the history of places and people we come in contact with every day.  It is understanding the history of our family and learning about our past.  

We see heritage in the way in which we behave.  We see it in the way in which we dress, the food that we eat, the music we listen to and the way in which we engage with friends and family.  

Heritage is the way that we learn, it is a way in which people share their knowledge and pass on stories and traditions and its what inspires people to start a business, to write a book or to start a community project.  Heritage touches on all levels of society from local communities to governments and even businesses.

Heritage is about people.

That is the significance and meaning of heritage. But more important than all of these, is that heritage creates a future, it creates a vision for the future for all those who live and create in this time and space and it gives them a sense of identity, and a desire to pass it on to future generations.

The protagonist of this story is a tourist going on a heritage tour in Edinburgh. As they walk around Edinburgh, they discover many buildings and structures which are over one hundred years old. The tourists' tour guide explains to them the story of these old buildings and structures as they date back to the 1800s.

" I had much the same complaint after seeing this tour. As I noted in my review, Ray’s command of the language is good enough for most of the scenes in which he speaks—especially when the two wives he kills disagree violently, a bit of stage business that takes all afternoon. His best scene, however, is that in which he addresses the role of Desdemona to the other women of the company. Ray is both impassioned and convincing in his effort to convince us that he can speak eloquently and convincingly only in the company of women and that he would be useless if forced to speak without their support. My complaints, I admit, were partly motivated by the company’s lack of female singers, but I was really only criticizing Ray for the way his performance seemed to demand that we take him at face value, the way he would perform without the benefit of the support of a female voice. And of course there is that to be said for the actor’s challenge to inhabit a role with conviction and even eloquence, so long as he believes he needs the extra assistance. But I would ask the company to consider the observation of a critic who’s seen a lot of Shakespeare and not a few other plays: what makes Othello any less a play for Ray Fearon than for any other actor? It seems to me that the only way to judge an actor’s success in a role like this is to watch and listen to what he does"," During my research for the production I was struck by how Fearon was compared to the many other fine, but older, Moorish and African-American performers who have stepped into the title role in the past. I have come to believe that Fearon has something real, something powerful, about him, and that he has been lost to the stage for far too long. 

The character of Othello, I believe, is not meant to be played by anyone but a man in his 40s or 50s. His wife and I, the Moorish and African-American spouses of the title character, are meant to be in our 60s and 70s. And yet I found Fearon to be eminently castable and believable as Othello. My colleague, whose opinion I value, was not so persuaded. 

Now that I have seen the show three times in London, and during the past week at Stratford, I can report with certainty that Fearon is not only a fine actor, but an unforgettable one. 

Fearon is an actor who does not need to play a younger man as long as he is a good man who, now, has aged well. He is a fearless performer who does not hesitate to move beyond the stereotype of the villain. And I believe him to be a star of the future.

In short, Ray Fearon is an actor I can think of no reason whatsoever not to embrace"," Since then, I’ve seen the show four times and now realize just how strong a role Ray plays and how much I was missing.

Othello was written in 1960 and published in 1964. The time when Othello opened in Stratford is likely to have been April 8-May 6, 1963.  

With this timeline in mind, consider the following assessment of Othello for Grade 2 students:

The play Othello has been written in 1960. The original version of the play was published in 1964.  The year 1960 was also the year in which Othello premiered in Stratford-upon-Avon.   So the play Othello was written in 1960 and saw its premier in 1963.  In our story, Othello is a critically acclaimed New Shakespeare play that is transferred to London from Stratford-upon-Avon.  Back in 1963, Ray Fearon was only a few years into his acting career and was not yet sufficiently developed to play the title role in Othello.  Therefore,  it is reasonable to infer that Ray Fearon is not yet sufficiently developed to play the title role in Othello at the time that the production opened in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1963.  Based on this assessment, Othello appears to be a New Shakespeare play that was written more than two years after the"," This time around I will admit my error, as Ray Fearon is indeed too young for the title role. However, I will also acknowledge that in my haste to be fair to both the company and the artist I was blind to the greatness of this portrayal. Ray Fearon is a star in the making, as he proves in this superb portrayal. His masterful acting will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish and even when he has committed murder you are still rooting for him to make it out alive. The superb cast also includes Rachael Stirling as Desdemona and John Simms as Cassio. The London production is nothing short of spectacular and could hardly be more timely in the wake of the recent horrific terror attacks on innocent Londoners. As a Stratford-upon-Avonian, I will forever have Ray Fearon in my heart. My apologies.


To improve your story, think about how the character would feel, and how you would feel if you were in the character's shoes. You could use facts and figures to back up your point or feelings. For example:

Othello: I was blind to the greatness of this portrayal. Ray Fearon is a star in the making.


Othello does not feel anything until he is forced to feel something. Ray Fearon's performance is exceptional, and he deserves our applause.


In conclusion, I was blind to the greatness of"," I will make amends by giving the play five stars and highlighting the excellent acting as well as some particularly fine fight scenes. 

What’s the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for Shakespeare’s Othello?

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a measure of readability that takes into account words per sentence and per word. Othello has only 2.7 words per sentence and 7.8 words per sentence. At first glance, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for Othello could appear to be 8.0. The lines of text are relatively short and there are few sentences, but the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale considers words per sentence and words per sentence. When looking at lines of text that are short and have few sentences, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level may conclude that the material is difficult to read. However, if you look at longer passages of text that have longer sentences, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level can help you determine how easily the passage of text will be understood by a reader. 

Othello contains only 2.7 words per sentence. Othello has 7.8 words per sentence, so Othello has fewer words per sentence than the average reader of that text. This means that there may be more text to read for Othello than average, but not as much text as for a reader"," Now that I have seen the show several times I can report that he has completely won me over with his impressive performance. 

A2 text includes basic sentence patterns using memorised phrases, explicit information and limited number of information points:

Now that I have seen the show several times I can report that Ray Fearon has completely won me over with his impressive performance. 

Othello is a one-act play written by William Shakespeare in 1601. The play, set in the Ottoman Empire in the 17th century, tells the story of the noble character Othello, who is unfaithful to his wife, Desdemona, who, instead, loves and marries another. When the news of this comes to the ears of Othello, the general of the fleet in which he serves, he becomes distraught and is believed to be a little crazy. 

Ray Fearon, who plays the title role of Othello, is 26 years old.

Othello is the 25th play in the Shakespeare canon. 

The plot focuses on the relationship between Othello, a general in the navy, and Desdemona, his wife. The play is a drama concerning the moral consequences of a man’s obsession with his personal honour and sense of justice.

It had been a good summer for Auntie Margo and Uncle Fred. They had settled into a routine which kept them busy and, in turn, gave them something to look forward to, every day. Auntie Margo was working a mixture of part time jobs and doing some voluntary work while Uncle Fred was very busy with the charity his own business.  During their holiday they had made contact with the friends from the south coast who were part of the school group.  One of these friends was visiting the area and suggested a night out.

On arrival at the Pensione Concordia the welcome was warm.  It was obvious that the manager was delighted to have their business and they were treated to dinner in the charming Italianate restaurant.   On arrival the manager had arranged for all of the rooms to be made ready and they were shown to their accommodation.  While Keith and Dawne were checking in they went to the bar to see what was on offer.

They came across an old friend who"," The Wrong Country Uncle wanted to be sure that there were no other customers on the flight who might object if they went to Venice and then on to Palermo: the last thing he wanted was for his niece and her two friends to be stranded in a strange country when their holidays were almost up. So they booked a plane to Palermo but when the booking was made he insisted that there was a flight to Rome instead. Rome was a more obvious destination for a visit to the old city and a stop-over for two nights on the way to Palermo and he was concerned that if Palermo proved an unattractive destination his money would be wasted on a trip that would fail for lack of an agreed start date. 

Keith and Dawne’s decision to take a trip to the Venice Pensione Concordia was a sensible one.  Firstly because this was a wonderful holiday destination secondly they knew exactly where they were going and where they were going to end up.  So it wasn’t like they got on a bus and ended up in a totally different city.  So the Wrong Country Uncle got what he wanted: the four young people travelled to Venice alone; they took a flight to Palermo and travelled on to Rome.  The Wrong Uncle was clearly worried that he had spent money on someone else’s children, but he was able to sleep easily that night knowing that there was no money wasted on a visit to a city he’d never heard of."," The clerk then went on to explain that the city was full of children from all over the world and that there was always a restaurant or museum to visit if your children were bored.

Keith and Dawne didn't know any Italian but they were confident that their aunt in Australia would speak the language very well. So the two brothers agreed to go and make the most of their holidays.  The next thing they knew, however, they were in a large Italian-speaking city full of people of all ages wandering around the wonderful old streets, visiting the most amazing old buildings and restaurants, and buying a huge range of interesting and unique items for their rooms and rooms of what appeared to be every conceivable size and shape. They were also being entertained by a friendly Irish family who had moved to Venice from Dublin only a few years ago and had taken up residence in their very own palazzo. 

They didn't realise that they were in the wrong city until they caught sight of the tall buildings to the south of the city and realised that they were in the center of Milan.

Keith and Dawne decided that Venice would be a very good place to make their home for the next few years, and they have been very happy ever since. They now have a boat that they use to visit all the Venetian islands that are a few miles away. They have also found a local lawyer who understands English and Italian, and he advises them on family and real-estate matters"," The wrong country uncle had booked the holiday for a group of thirty two teenagers from Liverpool. 

Keith and Dawne were not at all disappointed. They were able to find in the city, among the tourists, a group of friends and they started to make their way around, telling jokes in English and laughing. 

The hotel was just the right size so that the friends could walk together, through the streets of gondolas and past the market stalls of vendors selling flowers and buns. They ate crepes for breakfast every morning in the many creperies. The coffee in the cafes was strong, thick and strong black. 

They walked every day, sometimes visiting the art galleries, museums and canals of Venice. The friends read a lot of books bought in the bookshops, which of course were well stocked with English translations of the greats of the Italian language such as Mario Soldati and Francesco Sansonetti. 

One night they decided to go out and to celebrate the end of the week they went to a club, La Caffe e Le Colline. The music was loud, they danced, they drank, they ate the delicious pizza and pasta for which there were many restaurants. 

The week in Venice was magical. Each day was different: the weather was changing and there were rain spells and bright sunny days. They visited the markets, the bookshops, ate the delicious food and had fun at the clubs. 

On"," Keith and Dawne exchanged looks: they understood that Venice was a good choice, it might be very warm in the south of France, but the Italian School was in Rome. 

The Wrong Country Uncle must have seen the doubt in Keith and Dawne’s eyes because he explained that in the winter break, Rome was hosting a trip to Venice organised by the same agency. Keith and Dawne got the refund and made the booking with Rome as their destination. 

In December Rome organised a trip to Venice for 25 people, so Keith and Dawne went alone. What a great choice Venice is! So beautiful, romantic, different, a bit mysterious. And the pizza, Keith thought fondly, he hadn’t had good pizza in so long. So Keith made a resolution to come back to the city and visit the many pizzerias. 

On day two of their stay in Venice, Keith and Dawne started to worry. So many tourists! Were they all coming to visit the sights, to eat pizza, or just to take advantage of the warm sunny weather? To Keith’s annoyance the local boys and girls had ignored the Italian tourists and were hanging out with the Americans. 

By the time they got to the end of the Grand Canal a crowd of Venetian boys and girls had gathered around Keith and Dawne to watch them taking photos with their phones. How rude! They were clearly jealous of the foreigners. 

Keith and Dawne started"," So the Uncle insisted they go with him to the second floor to explain what he wanted to do. 

They were so lost in their conversation and excitement they didn't hear the heavy outer door open and the next thing they knew their uncle was standing before them holding a gun. He told them they had one shot to get back to the plane in time for it to take off and if they didn't do exactly what he said, they'd soon find out what the true country of their origin was.

They immediately started to argue for a better offer but he wasn't having any of it and threatened to kill them if they kept arguing.

A few minutes later he came downstairs carrying a few sheets of notepaper with the words ""Barcellona"" written on them. He asked them if they understood and when they nodded he left for the door.

After he had gone they both started to cry and tried to find a way out of the hotel. They first phoned their parents who tried to come and save them but they soon found out that it wasn't going to be possible. In the end Dawne phoned the police and gave them an address in Barcellona to come and get them.

When they arrived at the address that the police had given them, they found a car parked outside the house and the door was standing wide open. They slowly crept inside and after a short while they saw their Uncle, with a gun to his"," A family of four had to pay a supplement of £100 per person for the two of them to have the entire holiday for themselves. Keith and Dawne were shocked because this was more than half the price of the flight from Gatwick. Uncle looked surprised and Dawne asked him with a frown: ""why does it have to be two of us, why can't it be just the two of us?"" Uncle replied in a rather disappointed tone of voice: ""the terms and conditions say that the holiday must be shared, the holiday is only valid for two people if it is a shared package"". ""But we wanted to go on our own"", Dawne replied and Uncle said in a rather irritated tone: ""I am not the one who has to pay for this"", and went over to the cash register. ""But why did we have to pay the supplement if the holiday is only valid for two people?"", Keith asked Uncle confused. Uncle paused for a moment looking a bit embarrassed and then he pointed to the contract and he read the relevant paragraph out loud: ""the service is valid for two people only if the package is shared with at least two other persons, the minimum number of persons"".

Uncle returned a few minutes later and Dawne asked him with a worried look: ""why have we lost the package now?"", ""the holiday is only valid for two people if it is a shared package"" Uncle replied. Keith did not understand what Uncle meant and he asked him"
" Despite the public appeal of the narrative lions are actually solitary hunters who typically kill and eat members of their own species. Lions and humans have been in steady combat ever since a young hunter first stumbled upon a pride of savannah cats while on safari. As the story goes, over the years lions have learned to mimic the sounds of hyenas, wildebeest and zebras to lure them out of the bush. As a result of their successful efforts at deception lions are able to thrive within human habitats, but the truth is far more sinister. It is estimated that lions kill between 2,000 and 5,000 animals every day, many of them deer, wildebeest and other antlered creatures. This slaughter requires lions to expend a considerable amount of energy and be constantly on the prowl, but for all their ferocity lions are actually quite vulnerable. To protect themselves from potential predators lions rely on a complex social system, which includes a pride structure, territorial marking and the development of an impressive range of behavioral and cognitive skills. It is a remarkable system for a species who spends most of its time alone, but it is also extremely fragile. Inevitably even the most sophisticated social structures are vulnerable to the failure of a single member and lions have an exceptionally high death rate - between 8 and 20 percent - due to disease, predation, conflict and human persecution. The combination of these factors has resulted in an image of lions as noble hunting companions, which is far from the"," From the children’s story “Lions” by Roald Dahl. 
  Lions are big and scary. We don’t like lions. But sometimes lions do something surprising like hunt their dinner. Like most hunters lions will leave tracks. We see a lion walking towards us and we run away. The lion’s track suddenly stops. We see the lion is still there, watching us. We try to pretend it isn’t there and carry on as before. But we’re not used to seeing anything big and scary like a lion so we are a bit frightened. We think that the lion is going to hurt us. We start to scream and call for our parents. But the lion has already disappeared. We don’t know where the lion went. We wait but the lion doesn’t come back. We try to forget about the terrible things we saw but when our parents ask us about the lion we don’t know what to say. We say that the lion was very big and scary. Our parent don’t believe us because they have seen lions before but we know different. In the end our parent says we were just imagining the lion because we were being silly. The lion wasn’t there and we were wrong. But now we know the truth. We know that lions can really hunt and kill animals. We are glad that the lion was there to show us this.

  The above passage uses a variety of strategies to impart the important message"," But in the wild, lions actually show a lot more aggression towards each other than we tend to see in the movies. Many of the conflicts between lions are about individual cows. Lions will attack and kill cows if the need arises, but they will also engage in a fierce and aggressive wrestling match to the death if their opponent is a member of their own pride. Lions even fight over food that has been left at the feeding site - the kill is just icing on the cake. There is no love lost between lions. They aren't all that social after all. 

The following is a fictionalized account of lions in the African wild.  Throughout the text lions are described as apex predators, though they are only the strongest and fiercest.  When fighting among themselves lions are highly aggressive.  Lions often will attack and kill members of other prides to which they are not affiliated but they are not naturally hostile to all members of their own pride.  Cows are the major source of food for lions and it is rare that two lions will attack and kill the same animal.

Lions emerge from the dark shadow of the trees, their eyes searching the night sky for the last sliver of yellow. They've been waiting for this, the signal to attack. The lions of Siafu are the fiercest in the entire pride, it's been said.  They will kill with no remorse or second thoughts, and they will do it without warning. The Sia"," In reality though, lions are among the most social of species, and for the vast majority of their lives will depend on other members of their community to find and kill the prey they need to survive. To be clear, lions aren’t entirely self sufficient. They depend on humans to build their schools, to protect their territories from predators, and even to hunt the lions’ preferred prey of wildebeest. Yet the lions’ social behaviour, the way they cooperate and work as a team, is an image cherished by many of our human ancestors who regarded the cats as fierce protectors of their families and their lands. To the modern human eye it seems to be the case that lions evolved from a prehistoric community of hunters working together and basing their identity on the success of the group as a whole, yet from an evolutionary perspective lions and their social behaviour are not nearly as impressive as our ancestors imagined them to be, nor are they particularly helpful in the fight against climate change. Modern lions spend a significant amount of their time, whether foraging or resting in the company of other lions, and are not independent individuals but part of a small social unit, one with clear leader and rank structures and little scope for independent thought. At any one time lions will be watching, sniffing, scanning and occasionally attacking different members of their social group. This way of operating means that lions do not hunt in isolation. They use other lions to help them find their food and communicate with one another while they"," However the reality is quite different. 
  Lions are highly gregarious animals and live in groups of up to 15 members. These groups are led by a dominant male called the Alpha male. Lions live in territories up to 20 times the size of the living area they frequent. Lion groups are hierarchical. Young lions learn to follow the alpha and are given the role of looking after the pride. When the alpha loses the ability to breed (as most lions do after around 7 years of age) the young lions are given the opportunity to join another pride. When lions live in a territory the size of a small village they will defend it fiercely against other groups. Lions kill their prey by ramming their head into their prey's skull and shaking violently. Lions hunt in small packs, led by the alpha male, and each pack has a hunting area which is referred to as a ""lodge"". The alpha male is considered the leader of the group and he is succeeded by the next ranked male.
  Lions are highly social animals who enjoy interacting with other lions in order to groom and communicate the hierarchy within their groups. They use a variety of sounds, postures and grooming behaviours to convey their feelings and needs. There is great variation between different lion populations even within the same subspecies. Despite their differences in appearance and behaviour lions are actually very close to being the same species. 
  Lions in Africa are protected by government funded wildlife organizations known as national parks. Many people visit"," But what happens when the lions, though not a band of thieves, are in fact thieving lions? When a well-intentioned community group tries to make a killing in the market by selling lions for display, the result is a tragedy of errors. 

One of the leaders of the local community animal welfare group, Dr. Sally Cooper, is an idealist who believes that people will not want to buy lions from a group of strung out psychos that are in fact lions in the grips of a chronic, addictive desire to steal. As a result of her idealism she initiates a scheme to train a pack of lions, or, more specifically, a half dozen lionesses, as it is she who will run the lions - she will use the opportunity to expose the animals to the outside world, to new experiences, so they will not be so attached to their cages and their stolen meals from the local community-owned Lion Zoo where the animals are kept for public viewing. 

Cooper invites a former lion tamarin from the Lion Zoo to be the trainer, Ms. Sally Harrison, a woman who is as cunning, sly, and dangerous as any lion herself and who is willing to use any means necessary to bring this new venture to fruition. Cooper's plan to sell the lions for a profit involves marketing the idea that the animals are intelligent, self-sufficient, and more like a small pack of dogs than the starving, enslaved beings"," However lions are not social animals, they are highly inbred, territorial and competitive. In fact lions are one of the best examples of a divided personality. On one hand lions are a pack animal, the hunter-gatherers of their remote ancestors. On the other hand lions are highly territorial and competitive hunters of big cats. 

One reason for this contradiction may be that lions are not a true social animal but rather one of the most highly inbred cat breeds. While a lion can live for more than 50 years, they are not true social animals because they are unable to live in large groups. In fact they typically live in small family units or just a single adult male with his harem of up to 6 females. Lions are highly territorial and jealous, and would rather fight than live in peace. Lions have very different social behaviors from other cats such as African Pygmy and serval. 

There are also genetic differences in lions. The extinct leopard-maneulated leopard used its mane to keep rival males at bay but there is only a single lion species in which maned lions live, thus genetically there is no point in having a maned lion phenotype.

Lions are divided into two different personalities - they hunt individually as their primary prey, but in order to survive as a species they are unable to live without their family unit. However, this division seems to be a survival mechanism for lions. As humans they depend on each other to"
" Tito, a Brazilian-Italian-Swedish entrepreneur, has already spent billions of dollars on his ambitious plan to establish a settlement on Mars. And, after decades of work with top scientists and aerospace engineers, there’s now the real prospect of humans setting foot on another planet.

The Titos are a middle-aged married couple: both are energetic and ambitious. They’ve been working for decades towards Dennis’s goal of sending humans to Mars. In addition, they have two children aged 15 and 12. They live in a medium-sized apartment in California’s Bay Area. The husband works as a programmer, and the wife is a doctor.

As the only requirements, the Titos are open-minded, well-educated, with at least some scientific knowledge. And they want to experience life on Mars, which they consider as a ‘desert planet’. ‘Our planet is dying, we need to start saving it,’ Dennis Tito often says. His plan includes sending a Mars spaceship every two weeks. And the couple expects to return after 50 years.

When contacted by scientists from aerospace companies, the Titos are positive and excited. As early as 2011, they started working towards a mission to Mars. After many months of research and calculations, Dennis Tito’s group has found a private investor that will support the project with millions of dollars. The Titos will be the first Martian residents.

The Mission to"," 

In 2022 Dennis Tito, a billionaire with multiple business interests and experience piloting spaceplanes and robotic satellites, announced his intention to launch the Nero V Pole Star Mars Lander on 5 January 2022. The spacecraft, to be launched from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, would follow in the footsteps of previous missions, including the 1976 Orbiters 1 and 2 and the 1987 Mars Polar Lander, all of which reached Mars and transmitted images and other data back to Earth.

After a five-year build programme, Nero V was assembled in a specially designed test facility at the Space Center Houston in Texas. It was named for the Nitrogen Frost Moon Phantom, a unique and highly regarded U.S. Air Force satellite launched in 1978, which had an eight-year, multi-million-dollar lifetime. The Nero V spacecraft was a near-scale model of the successful Mars lander, the Spirit and Opportunity probes sent by the Mars Exploration Rovers in 2003. Tito named his Mars lander after the Nero V spacecraft, a military satellite in development during the 1970s which was the fastest operational satellite in the world.

  Dennis Tito, a fifty-year old American entrepreneur and engineer, spent his early years building and managing an aviation company that successfully flew several business jets to and from Mexico for various clients. His firm was also involved in a real-time weather technology, which was later","  Tito, an experienced engineer, is CEO of Mars One, a private organisation backed by Dutch royalty which aims to establish a human colony on Mars.  He is a well-respected speaker on space-related subjects who has travelled extensively to Mars himself.  His wife, a teacher, will be invaluable in maintaining the psychological health of the five crew members during their long-duration confinement on Mars and ensuring the successful launch and arrival at Mars.  She will also provide expert nursing and medical support throughout the entire mission and act as their surrogate mother, ensuring that the crew members’ needs are met.  As the first Martian mothers, they will play key roles in preparing the Martian environment for birth and ensure the well-being of any infants that may arise.  This will be their family on another world, setting an example for the next generation of Mars explorers and establishing a precedent of family life on Mars.  Tito and his wife, Martian mother and Mars father, will be remembered fondly by all Martian children and the human species as heroes who set an example of familial living on Mars.  Their accomplishments will be an inspiration to future generations of Martians and our own species will have a direct link to a pioneering Mars mission that changed the course of human history. 

In the above passage, Tito's wife will provide a surrogate mother to the crew, who will play key roles in preparing the Martian environment for birth and ensuring the well-","

    “Our family will be counting down the days until our mission to Mars, one way or another,” says wife Cathy Tito. They will take turns staring at a computer screen all day long, where our home-life simulations run in virtual reality. “I have a lot of ideas about what I can do to keep myself busy on the long journey, including building a robot that can talk and do backflips. “My three-year-old son could join us as we travel into the unknown, just to spend time with his mother. And I will keep busy by writing all the science-fiction stories that go along with the adventure.”

    Our family of four is in good physical health. We have a very capable older-model car that will get us there in just over a year, provided the road network doesn’t get too erratic along the way. We will have enough fuel for the entire trip, which should take about three weeks once we reach Mars, once the five Martian satellites we need to dock with do their thing. And all the supplies we can carry will sustain us for the 3-month trip, once we get there.

    “If you want to go to Mars, there is a place for you in space, and that place is Earth!” says Cathy. “Mars has a special place in the heart of human beings. The Red Planet is a symbol of exploration and adventure. The unknown is what draws us to","

The main requirement will be to have a strong cardiovascular system and high levels of Vitamin D. While space is hard on the body, the experience of living in close quarters with only a few other Martian colonists for 501 days could be just the ticket to maintain muscle mass and strengthen bones.

However, as the saying goes, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. In order to survive for the duration, the Titos will also need to live off Mars’ bountiful supply of solar energy, so the Martian colonists will need a lot of extra calorie-burning workouts. That’s because while the Martian gravity will favour people of average height and build, the Titos have hired the world’s most famous physique-trainers to prepare them for the challenges of life on Mars.

But when the Titos do finally reach Mars, will they find true love, family, even life itself?

" Other items can be taken separately – plastic bags separately from paper bags; aluminium separately from steel; glass separately from ceramic; organic waste separately from non-organics. These are separated and charged for. 

How would the charging system work? How would you split the money?


The garbage truck would come to a household and a bag of garbage or the contents of a garbage bin would be removed. The price per bag would depend on the weight of the bag. A 50 gram bag would cost 10 cents, a 100 gram bag 20 cents and so on. The price of a garbage can vary too — some bags of garbage are free while others can cost $10+. All bins would have a price: paper bags are $0.30 per bag, aluminum 30 cents per bag, glass 10 cents per bag and organic 5 cents per bag. 

Garbage bins would have a small label with the household’s name and number on it. If a bag of garbage arrived without a label, the garbage truck would have a pre-stored list and the driver could compare the labels to find the household. If a label was present and there was already a bag in the garbage, the driver could decide to leave a bag of garbage on the ground to indicate the bin is empty or to bring another garbage bag to the household, using the stored list as a guide.

A bag of garbage or a bin without a label would cost 5 cents. An empty bag or bin would"," The bags are then filled and repackaged on the basis of their contents for recycling or composting or whatever else local legislation demands. A fleet of lorries traverses the city’s roads, transporting the bins and bags of rubbish away. While this may not seem very ecological, the process is actually remarkably effective at minimising the waste produced. It is also quite cheap, in terms of the wages of the workers who move the bags of rubbish from the bins to the tip. The environmental benefits are obvious: we are more effectively minimising the volume of waste generated and hence conserving valuable landfill space. This is also economically sound, for two main reasons. First, it encourages people to minimise the volume of waste they generate. Second, the cheaper the collection and transport are, the more families are likely to employ it, so the economic benefit is also significant. Although this form of garbage collection costs the city some money, the money does not get reclaimed through the taxation system so, economically speaking, it is actually a win–win situation.

Note that this source is a very subjective view. It is one view and it may not be the best view to express your personal opinion. 

An alternative view:

Garbage in garbage out is an adage that has become part of our everyday language. However,"," So every day in a developed country you empty one less rubbish bin. The bags are not reused and end up in landfill. Some researchers claim this adds to greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, people don’t seem to feel any deeper connection with the environment than when they fill their rubbish bags. If they are charged for each bag they produce it may make them more aware. Also recycling or composting the contents of your rubbish bin may add to the cost of maintaining a household. If a family has children who produce a certain number of bags of rubbish then they may be charged for them. Charging each bag of rubbish could lead to a reduction in the number of bags of rubbish produced by that family. This might lead to increased recycling and composting as families felt under pressure to reduce the volume of their waste. 

Garbage in garbage out - A new theory on charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems to make sense environmentally and economically.  It could lead to more recycling and composting  and a reduction in the number of bags of rubbish produced by the family.  However charging each bag of rubbish produced by a family for the waste management services of the family might not be so good. 

In fact it may create more environmental and economic problems.  Charge for bags of rubbish and the families will produce fewer bags of rubbish.  Then they will use up the recycling and composting materials to which the charge has been made. The economics of"," This can be seen as yet more evidence of the marketization of everything. The families that produce the waste are then charged per bag of waste. The question is: who decides what goes into a bag of waste? The bag itself? The person producing the waste? The person collecting the waste? The city? The state? The market? Who decides who is being charged for what? Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be. Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This can be seen as yet more evidence of the marketization of everything. The families that produce the waste are then charged per bag of waste. The question is: who decides what goes into a bag of waste? The bag itself? The person producing the waste? The person collecting the waste? The city? The state? The market?

  * In Garbage in garbage out, the Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. The scenario described in the passage is not necessarily environmentally or economically sound.

  * The question is who decides what goes into a bag of waste? The bag itself? The person producing the waste? The person collecting the waste? The city? The state? The market"," Garbage and refuse collectors are usually paid by the piece of garbage they collect, so charging for rubbish bags will inevitably lead to rises in prices. If the fees are high enough, even the most avid collector may decide not to collect any garbage at all. Even if collectors are paid in cash, their eyes may well be drawn to more impressive pay packets. Furthermore, the bags of garbage may be of lower quality than in previous generations. Modern plastic, for example, is much more robust than the thin linen bags that often contain the household’s ‘trash’ today. But, it doesn’t have to be this way. We could follow the Scandinavian example and charge for bags of rubbish, but divide the cost between the households according to the weight of the bags rather than the number of bags. This would make sure that only the most conscientious collectors were incentivised to pick up the garbage. The bags themselves could be of higher quality, though probably at a higher cost, and the collectors would still be paid according to the weight of the bags. This would make sure that only the most conscientious collectors were incentivised to pick up the garbage. The bags themselves could be of higher quality, though probably at a higher cost, and the collectors would still be paid according to the weight of the bags. Alternatively, we could devise a system in which there is a fixed fee for every bag of rubbish and the consumer is charged an additional fee for the more valuable bags. This"," However, the cost of operating such a service can vary significantly between cities, from free in some locations, through to several dollars per bag in others. This means that some of the most wasteful families may be those least able to afford to separate out their own rubbish.

A tip is expensive to maintain and, once spent, cannot be easily reused. If all of the refuse were to be collected, a city could lose considerable revenue from this source: it would have to invest in an expensive lorry, and the fee charged to the refuse collectors would have to be sufficient to cover all of the costs of running the service. Furthermore, the city would have to build new storage facilities to ensure that it could continue to receive the large quantities of rubbish generated by modern urban living. 

This is not the only environmental cost of urban living. Research has shown that the number of cars on the road, particularly high pollution vehicles, is positively correlated with the number of people living in cities, since they enable the rapid transportation of goods. However, where the primary mode of transport is personal, high pollution cars become uneconomical (as they can only be driven for short distances). This means that many families may now be reliant upon the internal combustion engine for their daily needs, and so the production of plastics, exhausts and other by-products of car manufacturing is an increasingly significant factor of environmental concern in the modern world. 

So why don’t communities opt out of municipal"," Other bags of waste, from takeaway containers and newspapers to lawn clippings and other litter, may be picked up by hired pick-up trucks or hired motorbikes and taken away to landfills.

The amount of waste generated by any given community varies enormously: in the United States, per capita output is estimated at between 300 and 500 kg; whereas in Hong Kong, a city of seven million people, the total generated is estimated at between 700 and 1000 kg.  It is certainly not enough to build hundreds of incineration plants to dispose of the waste, nor to employ hundreds of refuse handlers. If it was, we might all be dead, as the quantities of the waste are highly toxic.

The environmental costs of living without municipal refuse collection are considerable: there is evidence of hundreds of thousands of tons of untreated household garbage being burned annually in China; another 3 million tons in India and Bangladesh; whereas in the United States and France the costs of untreated household garbage are estimated at over a billion dollars. There is also considerable evidence that where municipal refuse collection is unavailable, rates of infectious disease rise, as do rates of abuse of children in orphanages and nurseries, and of cancer in adults exposed to toxic levels of arsenic.

One other major consideration is that the cost of managing and storing household garbage is very high. In the United States, where this problem was first identified, household garbage weighs an estimated 250 million tons per year and would occupy over"
" I managed to find a good spot, between two people at one of the food stalls. I was too late though as the race was already underway and there was a young couple running through the stands. 
  
I watched in disbelief as the guy pulled out a goat and started running with it. While I was not surprised by the goat running, it was the fact the goat had a goat on his back. It had a goat on its back and they were both running around the grassy oval with other goats. I was in shock. The goat ran around for a bit. Then stopped at the post-start barrier to allow the girl and her goat to pass and get off the grass. I looked around at the crowd. People were laughing, people were cheering. The goats were being cheered for, their little legs pumping. It seemed so wrong to me that the people of Buccoo Village should be supporting goats running. The goats were dirty, the goats looked uncomfortable, the goats were out of control. It seemed like a waste of public money. A waste of public time. A waste of a beautiful day. 
  
The next day the mayor had a news conference and was furious with me for causing a ruckus in Buccoo Village and for causing the young couple to miss out on goat racing.  

This story is a satire about goat racing in Buccoo Village, and is not a real story.


Goat Racing II:"," It was this move that led to a new level of embarrassment as I was bumped hard into a person, falling into their arms which resulted in my ice-cream melting into their shirt and mine. I felt the hand of an older gentleman slip into my elbow and guide me back to the racecourse. We arrived at the fence and he whispered in my ear, “Put your hands behind your back, don’t look”. I felt a hand tie my wrists and I was given a drink from a cooler. Suddenly all the sound of the crowd around us faded and I heard the crack of the whip, I looked down and saw a goat racing across the desert. It seemed so carefree, running free, free to graze on the hills, free to make my way across the desert to a small wooden stake ready to be driven through the heart. Then suddenly I heard a scream, a cry for help. The goat had slipped and fallen backwards, his eyes were wide and his legs struggled against the ropes that held him up. The crowd around me was silent, some running away from the racecourse, others looking on in disbelief. The older gentleman was speaking, “Just stick to your story, this is a good story, we won’t tell, we need to send that goat some messages.” 

This is a story about a goat racing race, Easter Monday in Buccoo Village in Namibia.  A group of us were watching the goat race, the"," I watched as the sound of the crowd rose and the goats started to come out. I could make out the colours of the goats, some wearing green, some wearing yellow, some wearing red. Some of the goats were even in white! I had only gone to Buccoo Village a couple of times before, but it is a popular place for families with kids to enjoy a pint and watch goats race. 

The race was won by a goat in white. It was clearly in third place when it suddenly bolted away with a team of goats in pursuit. The goat racing rules said that the goat in white must remain in the start area until it had won the race. It was clearly going to lose the race and it clearly had no plan B. I watched as it tried to run away and I watched as it eventually came to a halt at the finish line. It looked at me with big doe eyes and then tried to drink from the bowl of water at the side of the finishing line. 

I had to admit the goat won. It looked like it was going to lose but somehow made a plan and executed it brilliantly. I was cheering for another goat in green which I thought was going to win the race, but it did not. The goat in green eventually lost and then the goat in white won. 

I went over to congratulate the goat in white and it seemed really happy to see me. I asked it what it was going through, and","

I had heard of goat racing but never experienced it in person. As I approached the stands, the goats looked nervous. It was obvious they were used to being the ones who were in control. I watched in amazement as the two goats who were racing threw themselves around, crashing into each other as they seemed to be trying to out race each other. Both of the goats were drenched in sweat. Soon though the race would begin and the goats would have to stay on their mark! I scanned the crowd for someone to blame for the lack of goat racing in my neighbourhood. But I was surprised to find no one was actually watching the race. A small crowd had gathered around a man who was crying. I moved closer to find out he was berating the owner for the lack of goat racing in the village. I asked what was wrong and he explained that the race went on for so long that he did not get a chance to eat his Easter dinner. I asked the crowd about their opinions on goat racing and found there was almost universal rejection from the crowd with the exception of a few vehement supporters. As the race came to an end the winner was determined by the judge in charge of the race and the winner went to the owner to retrieve their prize. I asked the crowd whose goat they thought had won. The crowd seemed hesitant to answer. After a short delay, the crowd yelled ""I say the goat that looked like it was having a party!"" I was"," I got there just in time to see the first race. A group of children were screaming and shouting at the top of their voices, so loud that I could make out what they were saying. “Come on Daddy, its Goat racing, lets go stand next to the barrier Daddy”.

‘Ok Daddy, but only if you wear your lucky green jersey.’ I was given the jersey and was allowed to stand next to the barrier where the race was about to commence. I was in for a treat! I could see goats racing, with the green jersey they looked like kings! ‘Come on Daddy, lets go’ I shouted again, but this time I didn’t hear the sound of the children so much as see them charging towards me. ‘I’m coming Daddy!’ They shouted and with that I was knocked to the ground, my luckless self right on top of the barrier. It wasn’t too bad but when I came to my senses I saw that the children weren’t stopping. They were running past like there was no tomorrow, and then in their hurry one ran up and kicked me hard in the stomach. Well I can understand that but that doesn’t make me lose my lunch.

So there I lay on the ground with the racing goats whizzing past and the children running riot. There I lay, feeling rather sorry for myself, until the goat with the winning collar came past, they cheered, I cheered and the children"," I was settled into my spot by the rail when I noticed a goat in a nearby field with the goatsherd who appeared to be struggling to keep the goats in the field. The horses were out first and seemed to be doing fairly well but there was an apparent lack of speed in the field. Just as the horses and goats were getting into a nice canter one of the horse stumbled and almost fell over. The goat seemed to have a strong will to win and charged straight towards the fallen horse with the herder unable to stop it. The goat however, appeared intent on killing the horse and not stopping at all. The horse struggled to get back on its feet but stood little chance. The goat was on it almost immediately and the herder had a hard time restraining the goat as it pushed the horse down into the ground. I could not take my eyes off the battle between the goat and horse and it is only when the horse was motionless that I realised the goat had killed it. The herder was not going to lose his goats for Easter but I felt responsible because I had not moved.

"," At last! The race came around and I took my place, the two horses came down the lane and I noticed the black one was pulling clear and winning the race. ""Yea Blackie boy!"", I cheered. My friends just shook their heads, I guess they thought I was going to a funeral. But I was so excited and it was Goat Racing after all. As the horses galloped out the finishing line I felt a sharp prick on my hand. It was raining peas! I had been holding out my hand to get one of the horses trample pea on the ground but got the other instead. I threw my hand up in disgust. ""Eww! I'm not touching a pea"", I said. ""What do you expect? They are animal peeps"", my friend said. ""Anyway, who won?"" I asked. ""The black one"", he replied. ""Aye that one"", I said pointing to the black one. My friend repeated what I said, ""Aye that black one"". ""Oh well"", I responded, ""at least I got to see it"".

" Additionally, the vast majority of historians don’t have the resources to locate a single source to verify an oral account.

This question addresses the feasibility of relying on oral history in the face of issues like that mentioned in the prompt.

0ral History has limitations. Many historians cite unreliable stories because the interviewee was influenced by the circumstances of the interview and had an incentive to impress the interviewer. Additionally, people are not perfect recorders; memories fade with time. Furthermore, the lack of resources can make it difficult to find and interview an appropriate source.

Despite these obstacles, historians continue to rely on oral history. Given the advantages outlined above, it is likely that oral history will remain a viable source for the foreseeable future.


While oral history has clear advantages, there is still the problem of unreliable testimony.  One reason for this is that there is strong pressure for interviewees to provide a good impression of them to the interviewer.  This pressure may lead them to exaggerate or even fabricate stories, either for personal or self-preservation reasons.  It is therefore important that historical researchers are aware of this factor, and take steps to mitigate the risk of unreliable testimony by:
- Obtaining multiple accounts from different sources, to check for inconsistencies and patterns.
- Interviewing multiple sources, to maximize consistency.
- Ensuring that the interviewer is trained to recognize unreliable testimony.


It is clear"," One must be mindful of personal biases, and the pressures placed upon a witness by the legal process. However, despite the difficulties, the historical profession would do well to employ skilled interviewers. It is one thing to consult printed sources. It is quite another to try and decipher the intent of an obscure bureaucrat who may have been high on morphine or a monarch who has been dead since 1837. 

Historians must seek to immerse themselves in their subject, and to develop the skill of ‘listening in’ to sources in order to gain a broad and deep understanding of the past. The best interviews are those that develop towards a consensus, and that the interviewee is prepared to express a range of opinions. The process is difficult and fraught with peril, but the rewards are great.

Use the following passage to develop your story:

Historians now rely more on oral evidence. It is difficult to understand the intent of a witness who may have been high on morphine, drunk or suffering from memory loss. However, it is an essential skill to gain a deep and broad understanding of the past. It is one thing to consult printed sources. It is quite another to try and decipher the intent of an obscure bureaucrat who may have been high on morphine or a monarch who has been dead since 1837. 

Historians must immerse themselves in their subject and to gain a broad and deep understanding of the past. In order to do this"," The historian must be ever aware of his bias, of the prejudices of the witness and of his own social expectations and presuppositions.
The growing tendency of historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that testimony of an interview is a pure distillation of past experience for the interviewers are affected by the other and their own prejudices. The historian must be ever aware of his bias, of the prejudices of the witness and of his own social expectations and presuppositions. 
While oral history is potentially a superior means of discovering the past it must also be understood that the biases and preconceptions of those involved are not always transparent. In addition the circumstances in which a statement is made and the interviewee’s standing in the community and social circle can also have an effect on what is said.
While oral history is potentially a superior means of discovering the past it must also be understood that the biases and preconceptions of those involved are not always transparent. In addition the circumstances in which a statement is made and the interviewee’s standing in the community and social circle can also have an effect on what is said. 

In the opening paragraph the author draws comparisons between oral history and other scientific techniques like x-rays and MRI scan, which also require an understanding of the object being studied as well as the subject, so that the investigator avoids ‘biases and preconceptions’."," Historians who rely too heavily on written evidence tend to marginalize the oral component and overemphasise the written and that leads to an incomplete and ultimately biased picture of past events.  

The prompt should be explained using examples and also include the definition of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. An example of how to do this is below: 

The British historian A. J. P. Taylor once said that “history is the history you don’t know about”. This is certainly an issue for those historians who rely predominantly on written sources to collect and analyse data. In interviews with sources Taylor discovered that they were often poor witnesses to the events they described, often eager to downplay or cover up embarrassing aspects of their past. 

Taylor’s findings highlight the problems that arise from relying too much on written sources. The oral dimension of history, however, is arguably just as important. Without this, historians risk under-representing the complex patterns of human society and the events which shaped them.

The prompt in your assignment should include the definition of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and examples on how it is explained using the prompt you have provided.

Examples of Grade Level:

• 12
• 15
• 20
• 45

The examples are taken from the description in the prompt provided.

A Grade Level measure was created in 1962 by the American educator Robert R"," 
Imagine taking someone’s word for a particular statement about a particular event even if the statements is against the norms for that event, against the norms of general behaviour or even against the own self-interest. The danger of relying solely on first-hand testimony is that, because the historian has chosen to be in that situation to learn from it, the historian is therefore implicated in the statements made and the stories told, becoming therefore responsible for them and their consequences. This is true whether the source is a living person or a recording of a conversation or even a transcription of written documents. 
If there was ever a reason to be sceptical of all forms of historical evidence, it is now. How confident are you that your own recollections of events are reliable? 
To what extent should we rely on oral testimony when researching history?

Your prompt should contain at least the following sentence: “Imagine taking someone’s word for a particular statement about a particular event even if the statements is against the norms for that event, against the norms of general behaviour or even against the own self-interest.”


The prompt should be followed by: 

Even if the source is a living person or a recording of a conversation or a transcription of written documents, we should remain skeptical and investigate the source of their stories. We should consider whether there is any reason to be biased in favour of the source or whether they are simply repeating what they have been taught.


In order"," Thus, the relative oral productivity of a source tends to be distorted. In other words, the number of words of oral testimony that can be assumed to be without error tends to be small. There is, for instance, the possibility that some of the testimony is in error because of stress, rhythm, and the like that are difficult to reproduce by writing. For example, when oral testimony is compared to written text, it may be that only a small fraction of the written text can be assumed to be free of error. This phenomenon is called the oral-v. written distinction and it is well-established in psychological research. This distinction is often used to illustrate that written text is less accurate than oral testimony. Historians, when using oral evidence, should be aware of this problem and attempt to compensate for it. 
Oral-V. Written Distinction 
Oral-written distinction refers to the phenomenon where only a fraction of the written material is assumed to be without error. The phenomenon can be observed across many communication mediums and when comparing oral testimony to written text, only a fraction of the written text is assumed to be without error. The oral-written distinction may be used to illustrate that written text is less accurate than oral testimony. 
Oral-written distinction has received significant scientific attention in the past decade. For example, studies have compared the content of short versus long sentences, written text versus dictated text, and written text that was self-reported versus that was"," However, the use of oral history raises a number of significant issues. The most fundamental issue for historians and anthropologists is the representation of personal experience in written form, because the subject is a living human being who can no longer state his or her views with the precision that is necessary in writing. 

As a result, historians must take into account that the author's memory was not infallible or that the author has consciously or unconsciously exaggerated or toned down parts of their story.

Another problem with oral history is the fact that different people may well have seen or heard the same event in very different ways. This means that the same experience may be described by different people using different language forms and different styles. 

Another issue is the preservation of evidence over time. It is not uncommon for oral accounts to become extinct through death, loss of memory or the passage of time. 

These issues illustrate the need for a rigorous approach to historical understanding that uses all the information available to us – namely text, photographs, video recordings and artefacts – and does so in an integrated way to generate a full picture of events.

  1. The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone's testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience for in an interview each party is affected by the other. However, the use of oral history raises a number of significant issues."
" He was away on a long business trip'. 

What does the above quote tell us about Lancelot’s secretary? 

She’s been forgetting to add sugar to his coffee for months. 

His secretary is a person who takes care of things for him. 

In this case, she might forget to add sugar if he wasn’t there. 

This could suggest that she takes care of things for him when he’s not around. So her forgetting to add sugar for coffee for months could be due to a lack of motivation.

"," That was a lie since he arrived with his coffee every morning, that was standard operating procedure.  But he was beginning to find other things odd. His coffee not being made. His chair not being pulled around. His telephone not being answered. It all got him thinking.'

What is the main point of the story?
Lancelot didn't take sugar, his secretary forgot to ask him if he did.

Why is this an interesting point?
The reader gets a sense that even when Lancelot has things running as they should, he could find things around the office getting in the way of what he is doing. In this way, his secretary's forgetfulness demonstrates the impact of human error, which can affect everything from the smallest tasks to large endeavours.

On the other hand, Lancelot probably didn't take sugar because he didn't realise that's what his cup was for. After all, he has eaten dozens of Lancelot cups of coffee over the years, and has no idea they are sweet. When asked, he simply says he doesn't know, which is probably a lie as well.

Finally, Lancelot's secretary probably hasn't forgotten to ask because it isn't part of her job description. She is not a secretary for the coffee machine, for example, and she does not take orders from the coffee machine. But most importantly, her forgetfulness is probably a lie, and she is not forgetting things because"," He was the CEO of a start-up which made sugar substitutes and had just taken a 2 week trip to promote the company and show the world what it could do.  In order to do this the CEO had had to travel to the USA to speak at various conferences and was using the visit to gather more research on the subject.  As well as being CEO he was also a dad, to an 8 year old daughter who had caught his attention at a school play and he had seen an opportunity to get more involved. So, he was there, the cups of coffee were there and so was he, all in the name of improving the health of children.'

You should now be about to start writing your story.  As you are writing, think about whether you can make the characters real and three-dimensional.  What do they eat, drink and like?  Think about the environment and how you can incorporate this into the story.  Also try and imagine the scene from their point of view.  What do they see, hear and feel?

Once you have written the first few paragraphs, take a look at what you have written and think about how you can improve it.  You may find that you can write the first couple of paragraphs differently but then lose track of your train of thought and your story falls flat.  This is perfectly okay, this is where revision comes into it.  Keep going and you will eventually end up with something that is really"," He had gone home at lunchtime and was now sat in his cubicle.'

The first thing you need to decide is whether the main character is a real person or a fictional character. If the latter, you have a choice of a number of similes to describe him;

He was like a camel drinking through a straw.
He was like a child who can’t stop talking.
He was like a dog with a bone.
He was like a child who needs to be fed milk.
He was like a fly buzzing around a candle.
He was like a mosquito in a pitcher of iced water.
He was like a fish out of water.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale ranges from a grade of 4-7 with 7 being the most readable. Based on the context provided in this paragraph, the main character's reply is probably in the 7th grade reading level, as there is plenty of material at that grade level that can accompany the prompt.

When reading the passage, you could first decide whether the main character is a real person or a fictional character. If the latter, choose the closest analogous simile from the list above. Then use this simile to analyse the passage in context:

  * As a camel drinks through a straw, so Lancelot drinks his coffee through his letter.
  * As a child who can't stop talking, so Lancelot repeats his","

He sighed and put down his coffee cup. The urge to take sugar was like a mantra for him. He was on his way to the factory, a few hours drive, the caffeine jolt of coffee and his daily sugar fix would be waiting for him. It was a way of avoiding the mundane office tasks that needed doing and the thought of going back to the office tired him. But he knew he couldn’t ignore it all day so he would drive on down the track to his favorite coffee shop and order a chocolate shake. He would have that instead.

And the mantra would take effect and he would find himself sitting in the coffee shop, his cup in front of him, staring at the sugar lumps and the shakes waiting in the cooler. And he would find himself chewing the sugar and the shake and thinking “That’s going to leave a mark”,  hoping the thought of sugar was working it’s magic and he would feel his energy levels rise. And at last, he would get to the end of his shift and with a sigh of relief, drive home and enjoy his night off'.

" Susan asked Fred is everything all right ‘the van said. Fred replied ‘I hope so’ Susan replied ‘but the removal man is telling me there’s a big dent in the living room wall’. Fred looked up ‘that’s a crack I’ve been meaning to tell you but I didn’t want to spoil the day’. ‘But there’s lots of cracks all over the place’. ‘Aye but the crack is about the same size as the dent’. Fred walked round the living room with the van whilst his helpers packed up the other rooms. They came back into the living room and Fred pointed out the dent to Susan. ‘That dent is where the crack started’. Susan nodded slowly. ‘It’s a shame’ she said. The team of helpers all started packing. ‘I’ll get the van to follow and you can come with me’ said Fred.

  * The house had been standing for 40 years.

Fred’s mention of the dent and the crack was interesting and showed"," ‘What do you think has being removed?’ said Susan as she watched Fred. ‘The television’, ‘The conservatory’ ‘The washing machine’ Fred said looking a little shamefaced and Susan looking a little amazed said ‘yes I was wondering that as well’ ‘Anything else’ said Fred ‘The washing-machine’s engine’ ‘Yup I don’t know what else to say now’ said Fred.

  
“As Fred spoke Susan noticed in the background the house was being stripped bare by invisible beams of light as her own eyes had been stripped bare of their distinguishing features by Fred’s removal man. Fred had brought the television, conservatory, washing machine, electrics and was just finishing packing up the washing-machine’s engine. ‘That’s it’ he said standing back to allow a team of helpers to load the van with the last of the boxes.  ‘I hope you’ve enjoyed your time in our house’ he said. ‘No’ said Susan quietly.

  
Fred the removal man walked away from the van and over to Susan. ‘Goodbye Susan’ he said and before she had time to respond he was gone.

  
Susan sat back in the van thinking to herself what on earth just happened. The van drove off into the distance and Susan realised she was now without her house, her memories, her family and her friend and wondered what on earth was going to happen next.  

  "," Susan was so busy packing that she had failed to notice the van which was parked in the driveway. Now it was time to say goodbye to her husband Fred has packed all the drawers with her wedding presents the photographs, photos and ornaments from family and friends the wedding present from her parents the clock and all the ornaments the picture of all their children who had grown into adulthood were in the photo frame and Susan was overwhelmed and couldn’t speak her emotion was visible on her face, Fred helped her out of the van and she thanked him for a most pleasant experience and walked with her husband and family into their new home.


Susan was very emotional and this made it hard to write a smooth story. She started by outlining what had happened, what the van was, a removal company and why they were there. She then wrote down Fred’s job title and team. She could then proceed to fill in the rest of the details.


This is the text of Susan’s story: Susan noticed ‘Removal of Distinction’ and indeed every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man with enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables and his team of helpers not so gentle. Fred had even packed her wedding presents the photographs, photos and ornaments from family and friends the wedding present from her parents. The clock and all the ornaments"," Susan worried what she would say to the children but there was nothing more to be done but to leave the home which meant she would never see them again. She could of course return later in life when she had ‘wound down’. She made her peace with it.

Susan watched in horror as the removal men packed away her family heirlooms - the family portraits, the family china and silver, the family ornaments - the silver Siena had been given as a wedding present - all of it packed in newspaper in boxes and covered with plastic. She could not believe her eyes - all that she had lovingly kept for over 20 years, was being packed up to be discarded.

Susan sat down and wept as she realised what she had allowed herself to become. She looked at the van as she knew full well what he was paid for this"," When the boxes were all in the garage and the van was waiting to take Susan and her memories to her new home Fred showed her the final box which was very small and told her there was one more thing, that ‘if she had any regrets at all she should put them in that box’. Susan looked at the box and noticed it was slightly bulging, it had an unusual shape. It was small but was heavy and she wondered if it was an heirloom or an antique from her childhood. Fred returned and said he could fit her in the next journey but she would have to check the small box. She opened the box and found a box of condoms and said that was the last thing she had to regret. Fred smiled and nodded as if satisfied, and Susan’s heart was filled with sadness as she climbed into the van. Fred drove back to the new house and was asked to wait inside while the contents were unpacked and inspected. Everything in the house was in excellent condition and when the family moved in there were a number of men in overalls in the house, they explained they were the cleaning staff and that everything needed to be cleaned and there was not much time. When the packing was complete Fred came out to take Susan to her new home and he pointed out all the boxes which he would remove for her. There was one more box he said that he would not remove because she had asked that she should keep it. She looked at it and it was full"," ‘What are you doing’, said Susan after the first wave of boxes had been loaded. Fred responded ‘I’m removing the distincatins to make way for the wonderful things that are gonna be here one day. Just like you. Don’t worry there is a surprise’. She waited until the room was cleared of all but the essentials then she stepped inside for a last look around. Susan felt a tear in her eye as the final sofa was placed in the garden room and she said a silent prayer of thanksgiving that she was going to be reunited with her beloved lounge suite one day soon. One thing you will notice right away in the house is that all the doors have been closed. Fred the removal man commented ‘That’s what makes it special. You always said this house has got something for everyone’. Susan replied ‘I know, Fred.’ They watched as Fred closed the front door. Fred looked at Susan ‘See it’s always a surprise’ and he handed her the keys. Fred was an extremely skilfull mover. Susan arrived at the office the following morning to the phone ringing. It was Susan she answered and said ‘Fred has arrived he is packing up all the distincatns’. Susan was delighted, well almost, her joy was short lived when she heard Fred say ‘No one told Susan about the surprise’. Fred was a good friend and Susan knew Fred so she didn’t hesitate and she said ‘What is it Fred’."," The car was loaded first and soon the van was. The back of the house was now completely exposed and the front was being packed into boxes. ‘One last look’ Susan said before climbing back into the van and closing the doors firmly. The van then drove off leaving the family home behind in a state of some order though certainly very disorganised.

" He said dinosaurs had feathers and walked on two legs like me. I’m glad to hear your eating noodles with good ol’ dinosaur skills.’


Then he frowned and asked me if I knew there was only one T-Rex in the world. ‘That’s because there isn’t,’ I explained, ‘there’s a T-Rex at the Natural History Museum. The one in TV programmes like the “Dinosaurs” show is a complete fake.’ He then asked me to show him where it was, as he was looking for it in his dinosaur book. I showed him to the dinosaur and explained that this is because the T-Rex from TV programmes doesn’t have feathers. He said ‘That’s why I can see them in your book! I was looking in the wrong book.’.


I’m not sure where this story is going yet but the point is that screen-based learning can be applied to real life skills, just with some changes to the story. The same method could be applied to other skills that can be acquired via media. In this case screen-based learning helped my son learn about dinosaurs, just by watching a TV programme. I didn’t need to spend any time with him on the subject, and my son could understand the material just by watching TV, so it was very effective. It is worth remembering that not all learning is created equal!


This was originally"," He said they were big and scary, but he didn’t know that dinosaurs were really extinct, or that they had feathers! His teacher came into the room and asked him if he’d been watching TV. He said yes, and then she played the video and he agreed that he understood the programme, though he still didn’t really understand all the details. I explained to the teacher that it was good that he understood the gist of what was being shown, but didn’t remember all the specifics. I thought she would agree, but she said that it was important that children understood the why behind things, so she would talk to him about why dinosaurs were extinct. She said it was because they were a threatened species, and their habitat was destroyed. So he can ask me about why there are no dinosaurs at the zoo, or read his own dinosaurs comics books!

After the talk with his teacher, my son said he understood why dinosaurs were extinct. He wasn’t sure about all the specific details though, so his teacher gave him some more information about how they lived, and how they ate and behaved. He has read a lot more since that talk though, and now says he really understands dinosaurs! His teacher has also suggested some Dinosaurs TV shows he can watch.

His behaviour when I quizzed him was really mature. He was actually a little shy at first, and then when his teacher asked him to look at me"," I then showed him images on my phone of dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. He was especially interested in one image which showed an allosaurus skull with a long neck and razor sharp teeth. He pointed to the picture and said ‘that is what dinosaurs looked like’. I think what impressed him most was the long neck.  ‘They were the pre-cursor to today’s birds’ I explained. He nodded and finished his noodles. I’m glad he enjoyed the story because it helped reinforce a few concepts I hope will be useful for him as he grows up.  - Name five dinosaurs that were from the Jurassic period. 
Allosaurus - Razor-sharp teeth, long neck, played an important role in the evolution of birds. 
Triceratops - Have two horned heads - first found in Wyoming, U.S.
Dilophosaurus - Horns on top of head, and horn-like structures on the bottom of the jaw
Thecodontosaurus - Have two sets of teeth, with the bottom set pointed toward the back of the jaw
Brachiosaurus - Had a long neck and big feet.
I hope my little dinosaur enjoyed learning about dinosaurs as much as I did.


Allosaurus - Razor-sharp teeth, long neck, played an important role in the evolution of birds.


Allosaurus


Razor-sharp teeth

"," He thought they were big and scary. 

One of the best ways to engage a student in a learning experience is to build a rapport and find things they are interested in. I think your six-year-old is interested in dinosaurs because he is a fan of the Jurassic Park TV series and because they are a little guy. You might find a way to ask him questions about dinosaurs and build on this interest to engage him in learning about the topic of “dinosaur nutrition” and how to grow a dinosaur.

  * Use the text box below to write your story.

  * I’m a little dinosaur. I like TV shows and my favorite is the Jurassic Park TV series. I play-act a scene from the TV show when I’m feeling brave. One day when I was eating noodles I noticed my teeth were not doing a good job so I asked my six-year-old why. He said that dinosaurs were big and scary because they are dinosaurs.

  * I like how this story develops a relationship with the reader: the dinosaur is a little character that follows a child around. Although we do not know much about him at first, we learn more as the story progresses about his interests and the context of his eating noodles.

  * We see this pattern in the text: the language is simple, without complex words, adjectives and adverbs. The sentences are short, to the"," He said they were all big and scared of nothing. He seems to have a reasonable knowledge of dinosaurs, so we’ll talk about dinosaurs tomorrow after school. What do dinosaurs eat? – Noodles!


Here’s a possible answer:

Dinosaurs are famous herbivores that lived millions of years ago. They had strong leg bones and sharp teeth, and are known from the fossils of many types of animals that died very soon after they were born. Dinosaur bones have also been found in China and Mongolia, giving some indication that dinosaurs were there many years before they were found in America. The most famous dinosaur was Tyrannosaurus rex, which is why my son referred to dinosaurs as big and scary of nothing. Dinosaur noodles are a play on words as dinosaurs are famous for having long necks and strong jaw muscles, and the noodle analogy fits because their long necks would be like a dinosaur's neck, and the tough teeth and strong jaw muscles would make dinosaurs good at hunting noodles.


While your child is a six year old, it might be a good time to start learning about dinosaurs, their habits and behaviour. He might even be interested in the topic and ask more about it at school, where his teacher can help him find more resources online.


You could also start the conversation with your child using the following questions:

Dinosaur –"," He said they were big and came from the planet ‘Mars’. I asked him if there were any dinosaurs still alive today and he replied, ‘No, they all died millions of years ago.’  

Using the text above, write a short story about a six-year-old who eats noodles with his teeth. Your main character will need to eat the noodles with the same method, and you will also need to provide details about dinosaurs and their demise.  

Screen Learning The little dinosaur was sitting in his favourite spot in the living room. It was a sunny day and the six-year-old was reading a book about dinosaurs. He was feeling a little excited about being a little dinosaur. He was ready for the upcoming meal of fish and chips. As he opened his mouth to take a first bite, he noticed his new toothbrush had arrived. He thought it was exciting to have a toothbrush, as it could help him clean his teeth. But, upon closer inspection, he noticed it was rather smelly and had hair on the bristles. He decided he would rather use his mother's toothbrush. As he began cleaning his teeth, he suddenly noticed a very small dinosaur watching him from outside the window. The little dinosaur looked very scared and ran out of the room. The six-year-old decided he needed to speak to the little dinosaur about his fear of dinosaurs. He left the room and knocked"," He told me that dinosaurs were very big and lived at the same time as the dinosaurs on TV. I asked him which dinosaur he was talking about and he answered that he was talking about a T-Rex. I then reminded him that T-Rexs are not real dinosaurs. He agreed and mumbled something about dinosaurs being extinct. ‘They are not extinct any more, T-Rex is,’ I said, ‘but dinosaurs are not really mammals or birds, they are a kind of dinosaur.’ He had a thought then and told me that dinosaurs are animals. He added that animals in TV were stupid. I told him that I didn’t mind him talking like that when we watch TV together, but he shouldn’t talk about animals like that. I explained that different animals might think differently and animals who are different might be nice or bad. I asked him what he thought about cats. He thought they were nice. He added that he would never eat one. I told him that cats eat meat and birds too. He nodded. He then wondered if cats ate insects. I explained that although they eat meat, cats also love insects and might keep them as pets. He thought for a while and said he didn’t know. He then tried to explain it using his favourite activity, play-acting. He told me he thought cats were in a room with lots of toys and they ate the small dinosaurs (which were their"

James Marr has been a fan of bamboo bicycles since he was 13 years old when his parents gifted him his first bicycle made of the sustainable wood. 

Bamboo Bike Club is the first UK bike-building workshop to use a 3D computer-designed frame created using 3D software. The three day course runs on Saturday and Sunday April 11th, 12th and 15th, at Kingsnorth in Kent.

The course is £250 for members and £295 for non-members, or £30 per day.


Bikes are fully assembled after the first day of the course and are then taken on a test ride after which the instructors will work with students to make small changes and improvements. 

During the course students will also create their own bamboo bicycle from scratch using a 3D computer-designed frame, using a mix of plans and 3D software. The bike’s frame weight is around 8.5 kilograms and will come with a number of parts designed by Bamboo Bike Club.

Bikes will be available to view at the Bamboo Bike Club website before going into production.


Courses run by Bamboo Bike Club are also suitable for adults or children of all ages. The course starts with a visit to a local bike shop to check out your options before determining the frame size best suited to your build.

Once you have narrowed your options down the Bamboo Bike Club engineers will create a","  You’ll have an expert tutor to guide you from start to finish.  We’ll take you through the various stages of bike-building including choosing the bamboo, selecting the components, sourcing and assembling the components,  painting and coating the frame,  fitting the wheels, and finally you have a weekend of riding the bike you’ve built  

Your instructor will be James Marr, a specialist in lightweight components for the bicycle industry. He’s spent many years designing the lightest possible components for road, mountain and commuting bikes. The Bamboo Bike Club was set up to showcase his expertise, building custom bikes using techniques developed over several decades.  Instructors at the club will be Ian McMillan, a specialist in lightweight materials including composite construction, thermoplastics and carbon fibre.

James Marr and Ian McMillan are bike enthusiasts who formed the Bamboo Bike Club in 2006 to promote the use of lightweight materials for bike framebuilding.  The Club has grown to  host several courses each year,  providing education and building the most lightweight bikes using state-of-the-art methods.

You have the opportunity to build a frame for a motorised wheelchair.  The wheelchair will provide your instructor with an opportunity to discuss the use of lightweight materials in frame construction.


James Marr and Ian McMillan's expertise in lightweight frame design and construction make them ideal instructors for the Bamboo B"," 

James and Ian will show you how to use 3D CAD to design your dream bike, how to find and select a quality component, and how to assemble it by hand. If you’ve ever wondered how the pros do it, this is the course for you.

The course content is aligned with the 5Rs of Bike Building: Reckon, Record, Research, Review, Resolve.


Story Idea 
James and Ian’s weekend at the Bamboo Bike Club is an inspiring tour through the 5Rs of bike building. By starting with a well-thought-out frame design, they teach aspiring builders how to select components and how to assemble their bikes by hand. The pair then reveal how to use 3D CAD to plan out every detail of your next bike, including how to take accurate measurements. In the final section, they review the history of bike-building and offer recommendations on what to consider when picking a bike.

The Bamboo Bike Club takes place every other weekend at a secret location in Surrey. Bike building is highly popular amongst engineers at the club, so they’ve got you covered. In addition to a course, you get a bike and a certificate of completion.


The 5Rs of Bike Building 
1. Reckon: Your bike should weigh under 12 kilograms.
2. Record: You’ll need to document your bike build and ride so that you"," You’re given the full kit to build your own bamboo bike, which will be unique to your specifications. You start with the frame: first choose a template, then choose the shape, and finally select the materials. For the wheels you can choose from a range of standard sizes and shapes, and a set of spoke wheels will also be included. To finish the bike you choose a set of handlebars and a seat, and then you choose your choice of front and rear lights, an aerator, and any other accessories you’d like. You also choose your preferred paintjob: several different colour options are available, and there is support available to help you pick the right colour for you. Once you’ve made your choice, you will be taken to a 3D-printing station where the frame will be 3D-printed, and you can watch the 3D-printing process on your laptop in your workshop. You will also have the option to have your bike printed “off-site”, at a much cheaper cost. Once your bike is 3D-printed, you will take it back to the workshop for assembly, and you’ll have a chance to watch the frame being built alongside the bike being built from scratch. Afterwards, you’ll go for a ride on the newly-built bike, and you’ll have the chance to explore the workshop and talk to the builders, who will be happy to answer any questions you have. You will also have the"," You’ll learn all the skills and tools you need to turn a chunk of wood and a few tubes into a fast and reliable bicycle, taking pride in your work as you create a one-of-a-kind ride.

" When the dominant male confronted the stranger he angrily informed him that he didn’t belong there and that he would have to go home and find another group to join. 

The stranger was surprised and disappointed but agreed to go home and wait for another day in order to see if another group welcomed him. The next day, the stranger returned and boldly approached the group he’d been kicked out of the day before. The animals in the group were also surprised but invited him to join, and the two groups became very close after that. The newcomer became the dominant male and together the group expanded their territory to include a larger area of the nearby forest. 

The story ends as it began: the two groups no longer interacted, and the stranger has gone home to find another group to join. 

What do you think was the cause of the conflict that led to the stranger being kicked out of the group? And how will this conflict be resolved in the future? 

This is a difficult question to answer because there’s not much context to the story. We don’t know the full history of the two groups, and whether the stranger was indeed “kick[ed] out” of the group, or whether he just wasn’t chosen by the dominant male as a suitable candidate. Either way, the interaction led to a peaceful coexistence between the two groups, and the group expanded their territory due to the newcomer’s leadership. So there’s"," 
  This male had two long spines growing out of his face, which he used to scare the monkeys away. He was definitely not part of the group, and probably never had been part of the group. The dominant male called the police, who went to look for the stranger. The police found him hiding in the neighbouring grove, where he had been watching from a distance. Unfortunately for the stranger, the police brought him back to the group, and he was accepted. 
  The police offered the stranger a way to fight his case, by filming the interaction from a safe distance and showing it to a film-maker. The film-maker would then be able to determine if the stranger was indeed a foreigner or someone who just didn’t know any better.

The stranger’s actions were clearly inappropriate, but the police’s decision to invite him back to the group was understandable. The stranger was clearly trying to join the group, so the police should have tried to find a new group to join instead. The police should not have accepted the stranger back into the group until they had a better idea of the situation, and the police should not have filmed the interaction from a distance. 
  The police had good intentions and tried to do the right thing, but their actions were clearly insufficient. The police should have asked the dominant male for advice on how to deal with the stranger. They could have asked the dominant male for the stranger’s name, and then checked"," It was clear to the vervet monkeys, as the dominant male was just as obvious in his power and authority, that the new arrival was attempting to usurp his position. The stranger decided to make his intentions known to the group. He climbed a tree nearby and announced his intention to take over the group and set up his own kingdom. The vervet monkeys responded by attacking the stranger and driving him away. In the struggle, the stranger broke one of his wings and his fellow monkeys bandaged the injury.  

The vervet monkeys’ successful defence of their community shows that even when individuals are well-established and seemingly unassailable, they can be defeated by an organized and coordinated attack led by another.  

The story demonstrates that an attack can be winnable even against a strong and well-established contender. This makes one wonder if an attack is ever truly unwinnable.  

The story also demonstrates how one can use attacks to defeat one’s rivals. This is a lesson that is important for all leaders to learn:  to never underestimate the resolve of one’s enemies, nor the cunning and savvy of one’s rivals.  

Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth

  * One day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees.

  * The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group"," His arrival had unexpected repercussions for the group’s evolution. 

In the next few weeks the strange male killed two members of the group and wounded several others, all because he wanted to join the group. He wasn’t simply a newcomer, he was a killer. And he did it all with such grace, with such aplomb, that a few members of the group began to wonder if he was not the bestower of his own greatness. 

This is the story of the stranger: 

One day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys I was studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger’s intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. His arrival had unexpected repercussions for the group’s evolution.

For the next few weeks the stranger killed two members of the group and wounded several others, all because he wanted to join the group. He wasn’t simply a newcomer, he was a killer. And he did it all with such grace, with such aplomb, that a few members of the group began to wonder if he was not the bestower of his own greatness.

This is the story of the stranger:

One night I awoke with a start. Someone was pounding on my door. As I rushed to answer it, I saw a figure, silhouetted by the light of the nearby"," The dominant male had worked out who the strange male was, and knew that his reputation for being a very nasty and disruptive character meant that the group would probably be better off without him. The stranger saw the dominant male and immediately took a step towards him.

At that point the dominant male took aim with his deadly poo shooter. It was a well-timed shot and the strange male was killed instantly. The dominant male then turned to the other male in the group, the victim’s brother, and told him to say sorry to his sister for letting him down, and to promise him that things would never be the same again. Then the dominant male went back to his grove of trees, and the victim’s brother went to his sister, and they went back to their own grove.

The strange male’s death had a drastic impact on the group of vervet monkeys, but it also caused quite a rift in the relationship between his brother and him, because, of course, the dominant male was the leader of the group, and knew best what was best for everyone.

The strange male’s demise wasn’t the first time that he’d been the victim of a human act of violence. As a child, he was attacked by monkeys who had mistaken him for a juicy fruit.

The victim’s brother and sister had a strained relationship for some time after the incident, and it wasn’t until the sister"," 

After several nights of watching, the dominant male decided to take action. He called the neighbouring grove, and after a few minutes of quiet conversation, the stranger decided to leave and go home. 

The next morning the dominant male returned to the grove where he lived to find that the stranger had not returned. He thought nothing more of it and went about his daily activities. Over the next few days, as the group went about their daily activities, no one noticed anything out of the ordinary. 

A few days later, the dominant male returned to the grove where he lived and noticed that the strange tree was gone. On seeing this, he decided to return to his house and to his happy life as the dominant male of the group. 

One reader might interpret this text as stating that the stranger returned home with the intended meaning: he had decided to join the group. However, one who reads this text in the spirit of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level would be concerned by the number of sentences, total sentences and total syllables in the text. The reader might be concerned by the length of the sentences. The reader might be concerned that a total of 14 words are used for “returned home”, when only six words would suffice. The reader might be concerned about the total number of syllables in the passage: a total of 17 syllables are present. 

The text seems to express two ideas with a relatively high number of"," 

Despite being a species classified in the Old World monkey family, the vervet is physically the size of a human. The male dominant saw an opportunity to increase the group’s security by taking over the larger rival’s group. 

He made an offer: he would teach the other male how to use a stick to act as a club to keep out other males. The dominant offered to teach the stranger how to use this club if he joined the group. 

The stranger turned down the offer and instead moved to the neighbouring grove of trees, sizing up his new neighbours. The rest as they say is history.

" To study them is therefore to participate in their production. But theory is the production of art in abstraction from the productive process. And to theorize is to take the objects of one’s theorizing and put them to use in the productive process. So the works of art, and consequently aesthetic theory, become an end in themselves. Furthermore, this is not merely an inconvenience, for the objects of aesthetic theory are themselves aesthetic: works of art. And finally, theory is itself the production of art. Now theory is production only insofar as it is the study of production. And what is the study of production but the activity of applying the tools of production to particular, particularized objects? And thus a theory of production becomes itself a work of art. Thus theory is production for its own purpose, and the purpose of production is production for the benefit of art; that is to say, the end of production is art.

This passage from Walter Benjamin is an example of what might be called Benjamin’s “technological utopianism.” It is a utopianism in the manner that many technological societies conceive of themselves as improving on previous societies. Technological utopianism understands its role as bringing new technology to light through careful analysis and criticism, freeing human beings from their daily labor and enabling them to pursue aesthetic and cultural activities to their full potential. Thus art, according to Benjamin, is conceived of and practiced as a new technology: a new tool that humans will adopt and use"," The aesthetic object has been transformed into a thing in itself. We want to know what it is like to look at the painting, but now we are confronted with a problem of a visual object that is no longer visually accessible. No longer just another thing in the world, it has become a visual problem, a visual obstruction.

What is the status of the painting as a physical object? The painting is no longer just something we see. We can look at it, but our attention is now diverted from what it is that we were looking at, and is now caught up in the experience of looking at a physical object in space. So when we look at the painting the painter and his brush and canvas are no longer primary. The painting itself has become an obstacle to our looking.

Now a painting isn’t the only work of art that has this problem of physical transformation. Take away a sculpture and you destroy part of the artwork. Likewise, take away a painting and you destroy part of the artwork. But this physical transformation is different in that when you take away a painting you also lose the experience of looking at the artwork that the painting enables. This transformation of something physically tangible into something intangible causes disorientation and loss.

Physical transformation has always been a problem for the humanities. We need tangible objects that can be transmitted verbally or in written form. In turn, written transmission of literary works requires a system for textually encoding the material. For"," They are not the thoughts or feelings of one or a few individuals or even groups, nor are they the conscious creations of a single genius. To treat them as such is a great perversity of human psychology. We see this in the treatment of the paintings of the Old Masters, where a painting's authenticity is belittled because it was painted by many people. We see it in our dismissal of ""theory"" about the world or even about the self, which must necessarily be based on mental constructs about external objects if these mental constructs are to explain what is going on inside us. We see it, too, in the way in which scientific theory has come to be understood as if it were a collection of ""data"" that are then interpreted in accordance with the hypothesis that was proposed for their generation. 

What is truly ironic is that the physical presence of works of art, of the thoughts or feelings of one or a few individuals or even groups or the conscious creations of a single genius, actually prevents them from being seen as such. They can only be seen and understood as works of art by someone who is capable of separating out the physical presence from the mental construct that stands in for it. The latter is merely an imposition, an attempt to create an aesthetic experience of the physical presence. And this is precisely why one should never destroy a painting or a sculpture, as this would prevent any individual from ever truly understanding or enjoying it. It is the ability to impose one's will on"," Yet theorizing about them is essentially internal and mental, i.e. in effect, theorizing about mental representations of physical objects. Hence theorizing about them must necessarily presuppose that the objects have been created at all, that they have “existed” and thus were susceptible to representation and explanation and ultimately to theorizing. But this contradicts the very claim on which aesthetic theory is based, viz. that these objects have been created or given form by the artist (or artisan, or craftsman) and have not always existed as physical objects. So now we are led to the further absurdity that all theorizing about artworks is itself an obstacle to aesthetic theory, an objection that cannot be taken seriously (Pollock). 

1.  Existing external objects are not amenable to aesthetic theory because theorizing about them is essentially internal and mental.


2. But physical objects do not require a mental representation for them to exist; they merely require being, or presence.


3. Therefore theorizing about physical objects does not presuppose their existence.


4. But if physical objects do not require a mental representation for them to exist, it is unnecessary to presuppose their existence for theorizing about them to be possible. Hence theorizing about physical objects is not an obstacle to aesthetic theory.


5. So physical objects do not necessitate the existence of the artworks they are said to aestheticize. Therefore, according to Pollock, existing physical"," For another: this material obstruction to theorizing has given rise to a tradition, perhaps inevitable, of materialism about art that has been unable to overcome the dualistic opposition between a work of art as object and as idea, reality and formal intention. The result has been aesthetic theory that can be called, by way of summary, “realism.” (…) It might be useful to ask, as an example of a problem, how one might account for realism and the “realism” which pervades our experience of art and our experience of the world, especially as the two appear to conflict. We could make some effort to think about this conflict by considering how much one requires of the object of artistic endeavor-to see it, to know it-in terms of intention, i.e., that an intention must be articulated in the work of art in order to exist, be realized, and so be able to cause that aesthetic experience (which is based upon that understanding of art) that we call realism. We could argue that the work of art as idea, reality is not realizable and that our inability to think art in this way has produced the “realism” that has structured our experience. It is our understanding of art, we might say, that is “obstructional” to theory, and our inability to break with realism has led, not without irony, to a materialist theory of art. In conclusion, we might say that art, as idea,","  They are material things.  The existence of physical objects does not conform to the laws of physics but requires an active and conscious effort on the part of humans to observe it as such. As soon as artworks are thus considered they immediately lose their capacity to be observed, which is one of the conditions upon which theory of art is built.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level was created by Professor Lynne McAlpine of the University of Washington and John F. Flesch Jr. of the University of California at Berkeley. It can be applied to any text, not just stories or novels. A story written in the imperative form (read the same way a person would speak) has a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 53, while a passage written in the present progressive has a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 45. 

Reading level is a measure of the text's difficulty. It is"," It follows that any theory about the nature of these works of art is bound to conflict with the physical nature of these artefacts.  

However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. A story told, for instance, in a village fete in France in 1928, tells of a village girl who had the good fortune to witness a miracle. It was night and the local priest was saying Mass in the church tower when a man in an automobile drove up and asked the priest for directions to the village's fair. The priest was very surprised to be asked for directions and in his surprise pointed towards the fair, but the man in the automobile drove off without even acknowledging the priest's request for directions. In her simple, local way, the girl made the following observation:

The priest has no interest in directing people to the fair. He is not a local. 
The man in the automobile is not local either. He is driving away without acknowledging the priest's request for directions. This is not natural. This is a miracle.

The beach was magical and exciting, but once you got out of the water and had to negotiate the treacherous terrain of the dunes that encircled the entire beach, you just didn't feel safe.  

Once I had grown to hate sand even the idea of going to the beach as an adult was more of an ordeal. My brother and sister would race over to the beach with their friends and I could hear the ruckus from the living room as I struggled to make my way there.

" The technology exists to make great television - it’s just that the creative teams responsible for making these programmes are not interested in the visual arts. In turn, they have not yet realised that the visual arts require a creative approach. In a world full of computers that know far more than the human eye ever will, it should be much easier to make television that truly shows work of the visual arts in their purest form. Television should be exciting, memorable and different. It is not - rather it feels the same every time, showing little more than a car passing in front of a building followed by a few characters having a conversation from a set perspective, and that’s only the start of each episode. As it stands, there’s a reason that art has a tendency to look like the Mona Lisa after being viewed on a computer screen - the medium is not suited to the artform. TV shows that try to make use of the visual arts fail completely. The only thing that can replace television as the medium of choice to view the visual arts is in person - to see the artwork in its raw form and to appreciate it with other people. Art needs to be shared, and television cannot share art. There’s one place where we can hope to change this. In the last couple of years we’ve seen some truly amazing television about the visual arts, from Netflix’s documentary Our Art that put the spotlight on some of the best and most talented people working in the art","  We constantly see documentary style photography where we are limited to a specific view of a work from a distance often of only a small part of the piece. 

The answer to this question will be that television focuses on what the viewer sees on the screen at any one time rather than allowing for long takes of the viewers viewing the piece from different angles or sequences showing the piece as a whole.  This allows for quick editing which is both effective and entertaining for the viewer. 

Note that this answer can be seen as a simplification of the complexities of the production process, the technical and financial difficulties of filming painting and sculpture, and the importance of allowing the viewers own imagination to run free. 

Answering the prompt has taken me to look at some documentary style photography of works of art in museums. I was surprised by the range of works of art that are shown in this way and how much detail is often shown of the works of art. I don't think that I have seen this style of photography of a painting before and it is interesting to consider the limitations of documentary style photography.

The link for this answer is here: https://www.theschoolteacher.org.uk/topics/tv/tvart.htm


The next question the students ask is: 

Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera which has the ability to show a whole work of art then move in close to examine the details.  We constantly"," The same cannot be said of television art programs where we are treated to static images of the art works and when we do get close examination of the details these are more like a photocopy than an authentic representation. 

In part one of the story you compare art classes in school with television art programs and in part two you consider possible reasons for the disparity between the art classes and television art programs.
  
Part 1.  Art classes in school - should be natural subjects for the camera:  


In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the art classes in school were naturally subjects for the camera. Art work was created using a combination of brushes, paint, and light which made it natural for it to be seen in the context of a large and moving composition. 

In contrast, most television art programs consist of static images of art works which are often of poor quality. While it is good to know the quality of the images and the creative processes used to create them, it is essential that we are not subjected to them when learning about visual arts.  


Part 2.  Possible reasons for the disparity between television art programs and art classes in school:


Another contributing factor to the difference between television art programs and art classes in school is the economics of television. When a television series is first created, the cost of creating a program is low enough to afford the series the opportunity to be created. As the television show becomes a success and more episodes"," It should also not be limited to just a single camera angle. We should be able to see several angles of the piece of art being depicted. Television producers will do their best to restrict cameras to just one angle and will often cut away from the subjects to another area of the studio to make the shot feel more authentic. Sometimes they will even employ additional cameras angles for the scenes where the artist is not featured. Why is it that television consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts?

Consider the following points:

Painting and sculpture are often shown in context (as opposed to being portrayed as isolated objects)

The art world is small and local, which is a challenge for TV cameras to get close to, and follow, especially when the programme does not have a established relationship with the artist and/or curator

The art world is littered with stories of artists being deliberately excluded from television productions or featured in very limited or misleading portrayals

Television producers like to use established artists with a track record of success to sell a programme to advertisers and public (and particularly the public in urban areas where television advertising is most prevalent)

A story about the shortcomings of television when it comes to featuring artists would be of interest to anyone who spends a lot of time watching television and enjoys art. You may wish to consider including the fact that there may be a larger agenda to exclude artists from art-related television productions. 

Here are two directions you"," However, the majority of television art specials are just a painter or sculptor demonstrating their work which is often so static and generic it fails to attract viewers. As an aside, many of these artists are sadly lacking in technical ability as the artwork displayed is not of a particularly high standard and so the television production fails to connect with viewers who have more often than not paid good money to see the artwork on display. This is not to criticise the art on television as many do bring joy to millions of viewers however there is something fundamentally wrong when viewers of all ages are being bored by the content.


Art on TV: Painting and Sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera.

Painting and Sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera. The camera should show a whole work of art. It should move in close to examine the details. 
There is a lack of technical ability in the displayed artwork. The artwork is of a poor quality and so the television production fails to engage with viewers.


Artist often lack technical ability. The quality of displayed artwork is poor.


Artist often lack technical ability. The quality of displayed artwork is poor. It also attracts viewers.
Many viewers are being bored. Television production fails to engage with viewers.


Artist often lack technical ability. The quality of displayed artwork is poor.


Artist often lack technical ability. The quality of displayed artwork is poor. It also attracts viewers"," Television, however, relies on dialogue to describe the scene, often with the camera showing only the broad strokes of the art work. This lack of depth fails to engage viewers. 
If someone presented a television series about abstract art, with the description “painting on a canvas” or “sculpture of a horse”, I doubt that I would watch it. The description is so lacking in content and detail that the viewer will be left wanting for something more to engage them and the viewer will look to the art work for clues as to what might be happening. 
Television series about the visual arts need to show as much as they talk about. The viewer must see the brush strokes and consider the scene from the point of view of the artist. Television series should be like visiting a gallery - look, look, look and ask yourself “who is that, where did they get that, how long did it take and what is their interpretation of that?” 
While art should have depth and meaning, television series about the visual arts should show as much and then some. It should exhibit the technical aspect of the work with a description of the subject and context. Then it must exhibit the artistic interpretation of the scene and how the artist arrived at that. When viewers watch the work of art, they are not looking for the words, they are looking for an experience.


Art on TV can be described as a scene from a television series about the visual arts. This scene fails to"," But, unfortunately, the opposite is true and the programme makers seem more interested in showcasing their budgets and personnel, the equipment they have purchased or the glitz and glamour associated with being on television than getting to grips with the subject. The programme makers should be looking to find a small UK based artist who is neither well known nor particularly expensive to commission to paint a large painting on a large canvas for one of the main television networks or even a corporation. They should then allow the artist to paint the image and have a camera crew following him or her to capture the scene as it occurs. The programme makers will be able to afford the artist's work and it will be a nice publicity coup, even for a commercial programme. The programme makers would be surprised at how much interest there will be in watching the art unfold before them and if they allow for the delay in the programme it will allow the art work to settle into the canvases, viewers will feel more engaged with the subject matter and will look at the programme as art piece of art itself. The commercial television network will have made a nice profit on the commission and their corporation will have benefited by having an image of a work of art being painted being shown to the public. Even the artist would benefit as he or she will have secured a good commission for their work and will have an opportunity to further develop their creative skills on a large canvas at the request of one of the largest corporations in the world.

The following is a fictitious story written by Michael Wincott. 

“I’m not sure if you’ve ever thought about getting a haircut, but your current style—long on top, sharp on the sides, with some spikes in the back—just isn’t very attractive, and is potentially dangerous. 

You have such an enormous fan base from your on-screen violence that you should of course keep your hair like that, but that’s not what we’re here for today. We’re here to talk about your art, and how you use it. 

Your performance in the new film, The Lion Guard, was excellent. I have seen it twice and both times, I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through. 

Your character, Kira, was fearless, brave, and intelligent. There was so much depth to her, and she spoke so clearly, that it was easy to see her inner thoughts. 

Most importantly, I felt for her. I felt for her because she was so relatable. I understood her and how she felt; she could have easily been my sister. 

Your hair makes that impossible. Your hairstyle isn’t the most flattering on most people, and can even be a deterrent to women actually giving you a second look. 

But more than that, it detracts from the beauty that is your acting. There"," While an actor’s craft is to an extent a self-taught process that can only be mastered with a lot of experience, there are certain basics that most will fall back on time and time again. Here are five of those basics:

1. Basic posture: The most important thing an actor has to remember is that posture is important. A good posture will make a person look taller, look more mature and be much more physically impressive. All good things in life

2. Basic breathing: When an actor breathes the scene will breathe with them. An actor should be able to exhale strongly at one time and weakly at another. This means that when the character in the scene is angry, the actor will be angry. When the character in the scene is scared, the actor will be scared. When they are nervous, the actor will be nervous. When they are excited, the actor will be excited. One of the best ways to master this is through trial and error and a lot of reading.

3. Basic eye contact: It can be a subtle thing but when an actor looks into the eyes of the camera it can communicate so much. If the actor looks away, they lose the intensity of the eye contact. It can also give the impression that the actor doesn’t want to be there and it can communicate a similar idea of being nervous. One of the best ways to combat this is by having the actor look at the camera even when not"," One of the more recent (and entertaining) examples was when Ben Affleck, at the age of 25, was cast in the Academy Award-nominated film Argo. Affleck’s performance in the critically-acclaimed movie was well-received and he was widely lauded for his acting skills. As he got more and more work, his agent and publicist were required to speak to the media and field questions from the media regarding Affleck’s career, etc.  When questioned about Affleck’s performance in Argo, the agent answered “Sure he was fine in Argo but his other movies….”  And the agent went on to cite a series of Affleck’s other movies that many viewers and critics had found “lame” and “unwatchable”.  The agent used the word “lame” to describe Affleck’s performances in several movies that were not Academy Award-nominated movies and which were not well-received.  The word “unwatchable” was used in relation to Affleck’s performance in the critically-panned crime drama White House Down.  
    The most recent example of this disdain, in my own opinion, is The Dark Knight Rises.  There are many aspects of Bale’s performance that were lauded by fans, critics and movie-goers.  When I saw the film it was clear to me that Bale was well-"," It is only natural that many people would feel contempt for an actor when that person fails to perform a role or a series of scenes as per the director/producers’ exact requirements.

Here is an example of a Grade 2 story using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level as a measuring stick: 
“The Actor’s Craft: Derision and Contempt Sprayed at Actors from Time to Time” 
In the film, “The Actor’s Craft,” a critic says “Derision and Contempt were sprayed at actors from time to time.” Based on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level measuring stick, this sentence is considered to be at a Grade 2 level because the words “sprayed” are short and easy to read when compared to the words “fail to perform” which are considered to be at a Grade 4 level. 

“Sprayed” is considered to be at a Grade 2 level because it is shorter and easier to read than “fail to perform,” which is considered to be at a Grade 4 level. 

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level measuring stick was created to compare the length of words and phrases. It was created to help identify language that is simple to read and understood compared to language that is complex and difficult to understand.


The phrase “derision and contempt were sprayed at actors from time to time” is considered to be at a Grade 2 level because the phrase is short"," However, there is some derision aimed at film and theatre that doesn’t really understand what it is to be an actor. A popular and often repeated example is the claim that film and television “write” their scripts already pre-defined. In other words, the characters and situations depicted by the screen are not those written by the film/TV producer, who typically does not know the characters or situations that the screen will depict. This claim is false. The screen writers who are hired by the film or television studios have read the scenes and know the characters and situations. They consult with the producers to ensure that the storyboard and story details are consistent with the characters and situations. The screen writers also ensure that the character motivations, mood, and tone are consistent throughout the screenplay. Actors do not “write” their roles on a per-episode or per-season basis. These episodes are constructed by the writers with the actors in mind. Actors may suggest variations to their episode concepts, but the concepts of the episodes are agreed upon by the writers and producers. Actors may suggest an episode’s or scene’s premise; however, the writers and producers are ultimately in charge of the final content. The Actors’ Craft has some errors that assume an actor writes their lines before an edit has begun. In reality, scripts go through many revisions before they are accepted for filming and television productions may even go through many drafts. Screenwriters often work with producers to rework"," Yet many actors will say they simply want to act, not talk about it. And for the most part, they’re right to want to avoid this conversation. However, as I walked through the Melbourne International Film Festival this year, I was fortunate to witness one of Australia’s great actors speaking about his craft. I won’t mention his name, because he plays Australian actors very close to his chest, but I will mention that he is extremely talented, and he shouldn’t be speaking about acting at all—he should be paid for his efforts! 
When one considers the number of words in an actor’s interview for a role, they might reasonably conclude that they are either very forthcoming in sharing their insights into their craft or, alternatively, rather reserved when asked to talk about themselves. This, of course, isn’t entirely true. In fact, as I witnessed while watching the actor I referred to speak, I realised that many fine actors, when faced with a difficult role to take on, will go out of their way to study the text meticulously, reading, re-reading and pondering every word. Some even prepare “mood balls” of important lines or beats of a scene. All of this preparation is because they care deeply about the role, and they know that if they don’t execute their lines or beats with precision, they will look stupid. What’s more, if they fail to execute a given line, the interviewer might simply","

" We have become a society that demands so much and is not prepared to make any reasonable contribution to the success of our most successful individuals. The answer is simple: change the rewards system and enhance the recognition of those who have given their all. In today’s corporate world we need to look for more innovative and creative rewards. Instead of money we need to recognize people who have taken risks and made a difference. Instead of status, we need to find ways of acknowledging those who have worked their way up the corporate ladder and have successfully taken on bigger responsibilities. It is not acceptable to say to an engineer “you’ve done a fine job but we don’t acknowledge your contributions”. The same should be said of all professionals and people should be rewarded for what they have achieved. Those who are innovative and create new products should be appropriately recognized. In fact recognition should be our constant companion and it should be given to all those who are successful, even if we do not understand or appreciate their contributions. We should recognize success but also recognize where we went wrong and create rewards accordingly. The rewards system should recognize failure with education, support and a commitment to understanding why this individual has not reached the level of success that we all aspire to. We will then make better decisions in the future.

Theodore Zeldin is a Professor of American Literature and Cultures at Harvard University. He is the author of nine books, including The Crown of Life: Reflections on Life, Death,"," This lack of esteem may lead to people turning to art as a means of redress. But the ability to be appreciated is no longer dependent upon the size of your bank balance. What if we rewarded people on the basis of how much they contributed, rather than how much they achieved? And what if there was a way to quantify the contributions of each individual? A new approach to employee appraisal could dramatically improve workplace satisfaction, productivity and quality of life.  Employees could feel valued for their skills and experiences, not just for their roles, and their overall contribution to the business could be known. It’s likely that employees would resent any change, especially as they may feel that they have already done the hard work to earn their recognition. They may resist the idea that they must go “above and beyond” to receive recognition. But, if we are truly to value what people contribute, then they must be valued for what they contribute. This has the potential to transform workplaces, industries and societies and is likely to change your business in ways you could not imagine.  You could be working for a company that promotes employee contribution, to develop new ideas, be a pioneer in a field, take on more responsibility or help people to do their jobs better. A company might then measure employee contribution in terms of company performance, customer satisfaction and innovation. An employee who contributes to this will then be rewarded with a higher salary and bonus. The system would give recognition for achievements but it would recognise and"," It is time to re-imagine success, for success is not just about what you receive, it is about what you are capable of giving too. So instead of success we have Karma, where we can either receive or give unasked for criticism. What if success were not only about what you do but also about how you do it? What if you could decide to leave a career when you want, where you want, how you want? Wouldn't that be nice to be able to decide at your age when you want to move on?  We are at the age when we can decide whether to continue working and we are allowed to change our mind. What would you do with that freedom? Would you continue in a career that no longer seems right to you? Or would you do something completely different?  What if you could also decide when to stop working? What if there were no retirement age, you could decide at any age when it was time for you to stop? What if you could also decide to start something new when it was the right moment for you? Would you still want to work? The answer of course is that if you are able to change your working situation when you want, how you want, and if you are allowed to stop work then almost certainly you would want to work. Why would you stop working, you may wonder. The short answer is: money. You may be underpaid, overworked, not appreciated. You may want to"," The work world is increasingly challenging and unrewarding. But as a species we are unique. We have managed to evolve to be a cooperative species. We work because our genes are optimized for our ancestors to hunt and feed. The hunter-gatherer lifestyle is not something we could go back to. Instead we have created a division of labor between workers and bosses, and are rewarded for productivity. 
There is more to life than work. We need to spend time with our families and friends. We need time to relax and pursue hobbies. We need to rest and be social. We need more leisure time. 
So how will we manage to get more of what we value? I believe that we will have to shift our attention from a focus on productivity to something we call the work-life balance. To me that sounds like the best way to sum up my vision of a more rewarding and satisfying life. 

Theodore Zeldin, a professor at Boston University, believes that we need a work-life balance. In his book, The Work of Nations, he argues that the industrial age was founded on productivity, which was not in line with human evolution. He states that our genes are optimized for hunting and gathering. 

Zeldin points to a division of labor that was created between workers and bosses, as well as a focus on productivity. He believes that focus on productivity led to problems, as it was not in line with human","

"," We have lost the sense of the individual and the notion of the unique contribution to human welfare. We know enough about other species, we are able to look at climate change, we even have a much stronger understanding of our own body, and yet no one is truly valued on their own account. Instead, we are valued in relation to others. One of the most obvious markers of this new world of valuing is that there is more of us and we are having so much more success. This is because more of us are valued and this value comes from a much broader sense of what it means to be a human and what it means to contribute to the welfare of the world. We are able to measure this contribution and thus create a sense of value which previously only existed in the more nebulous and subjective form of individual or peer esteem. The result is that while a job may be necessary to survive, there is now much more than this and we are valued for much more than simply our ability to perform the duties of our role. 

How will this change our working lives? The first indication is that we are having more children. This is happening for multiple reasons, both intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic is that we want to be able to provide for our families and thus have more children. Extrinsically, women have more rights, and thus they want to have more children to ensure that their families are financially secure. Also, the increased awareness of climate change and the resultant","  That does not mean that there is nothing to be said for the progress we have made in reducing abuse, inequality, exploitation and the threat of war to our planet.

" To put it simply humans can communicate using words. A unique set of symbols that can be used to convey a range of meanings. But why is language so important, how exactly does it work and what are the implications of our ability to express ourselves through words? 
  We will never be able to answer these questions fully as they touch on some of the most complex and mysterious aspects of the human experience. But we know a little bit about how language works and how it has developed over time and it has shaped our interactions, our understanding of the world and our species. Language  isn’t just for words of sense, it can convey an abstract idea or even a feeling as well. For example, you can say “I miss her” to mean you miss your mother or you can say “I love you” to express your feelings towards a person or a thing. 
  But more importantly language provides a way to connect with other humans and to understand how they think and feel. For all our differences language serves as the common ground we can all relate to and express our emotions through. Language also allows us to understand the thought processes of another person, to decipher their expressions, emotions and even their internal mental processes. 
Anatomically speaking our brains are designed to understand and interpret the meaning of language, it is how our brains communicate with each other that makes us unique individuals with our own individual thoughts and feelings. Language is not just an arbitrary choice humans have made, it"," 
  Language is a product of our imagination. As we grow up our brains are exposed to many different languages and begin to interpret the symbols used in each. Our brains start to form expectations about the way different sounds and symbols are used and this begins to shape how we think. 
  Language provides the means to communicate ideas and feelings from one human to another in a way that allows the participants to feel they have contributed something to the conversation. When children grow up without language it can feel as though they have lost a way to communicate their individual thoughts. 
  Children who do not have language are known as ""deaf"" or ""bald"". These are derogatory terms that still shape how many Deaf or Deaf-Blind people feel about their social identity. Language is also often described as a ""miracle"" that allows us the ability to communicate ideas and feelings from one human to another in a way that allows the participants to feel they have contributed something to the conversation.
  This miracle has come at a high cost. The loss of language amongst the most vulnerable in our society is a form of ""silent crime"" that we can do much to reverse. The language that is still spoken today is derived from a common ancestor with spoken language from over 10,000 years ago and in that time it has developed to provide a means for communication between humans that is now nearly impossible without. 
  Language allows us to express our thoughts and emotions in a way that allows us to"," Some will be speaking English, some Spanish, some Chinese, while others may have no words at all and point at each other while muttering to themselves. But no matter the tongue spoken or the alphabet read, the thoughts that pass between us are identical; in essence, we are each other’s window into the thoughts of others. And now, let us play a little game. The object of the game is to guess who spoke what to whom. So who said “I think” and who responded with “You must be thinking”. The answer: You spoke; you are thinking. So who said “And” and who responded with “And”. The answer: You said “And” and I said “And”! It is you, me and And that are playing this game of Language You and I. And we are sharing secrets from our minds; our deepest thoughts and feelings, our desires and doubts. We are able to share these thoughts and emotions because language is so tightly woven into our experience that we have developed remarkable techniques to decipher each other’s meaning. First, let us take the simpler cases; you said “I think” and I responded with “You must be thinking” There is no trickery involved. There is a word for these types of interaction, conversation. And language experts call it “conversation” simply because we cannot do without it. Without conversation there would be no human connection and hence no innovation or progress. But what happens when we get to"," This language may come in the form of written or spoken words or symbols imbued with either one or both of these. Some examples of this phenomenon are as follows: The man with the limp says sorry you just stepped on my blue sock.

Some people lack the ability to speak, sign or use any other form of language. They are non-communicative language disabled (NCLD). 

One day it was rumoured that one such non-communicative language disabled had been sighted in the high mountains, deep in the forests. They say that she could understand and speak almost perfectly in the Dholuo language of the mountain people. But this was only rumour. Nobody had ever set eyes on such a creature. It was whispered that one day someone would sight such a creature but that it would be unlikely they would survive the journey back to the lowlands and their chance of ever talking to another would be lost. 

But that was seven years ago and today it was announced that such a creature had been sighted in the forest high above the village of Sanetti Solleghense. 

The villagers of Sanetti Solleghense gathered to hear the incredible story and excitement ran through the village. With a sense of pride they announced that they had selected Dholuo as the language of instruction in the village primary school. It would be taught from early on by a dedicated team of teachers. It was announced that they had also secured a special class in the evenings for non-verbal language impaired children. 

Sightings of non-communicative language disabled had never been more"," Language is so fundamental to who we are that when our language skills fail or are intentionally disabled by governments or oppressive religious groups we are unable to function. 
This ability to communicate with each other across distances and time with the aid of a tool so incredibly complex has endowed us with the unprecedented power to shape the course of human events. It is the means by which we have united to bring suffering and oppression upon one another and now is the time for us to use our language skills to bring freedom to millions. 
For many years I lived in isolation believing that if I spoke loudly enough and with enough conviction I would be able to reach a sufficient number of people to overcome the oppressive regime and bring about the freedom that is now within my grasp.  I had thought that if I were to share my idea for freedom and the urgency of it I would be rewarded with success, but it never happened that way. I would always find that instead of reaching a sufficient number of people the idea and the strength of my conviction was met with silence. In frustration I would give up and return to my quiet and solitary life.

It is clear you share similar ideals and goals for the world.

" From Joseph Beuys and Rudi Gernet to Bruce Nauman and John Cage, the show explores the ways in which the invention of movement has been used to investigate notions of space, perception, artifice and power. The exhibition is especially interesting for its inclusion of works by women artists, who are typically under-represented in contemporary kinetic art collections. But this is the art world we’re talking about: a few misguided men (or women) can change the course of history.

Kinetic Art Rejoice opens at the Hayward Gallery in London on 9 March, and runs until 24 March. You can pre-order tickets on the gallery’s website.

Kinetic art is a broad and vague term which can refer to a range of artistic disciplines which investigate movement in various forms. The origins of kinetic art can be traced back to the first half of the twentieth century. Bruce Nauman, Joseph Beuys and Rudi Gernet were amongst the artists who made kinetic art a central concern throughout the century.

Kinetic art also carries more recent cultural connotations which refer to work involving “jumping” or “warping” of the art form to create surprising and even disconcerting results. This is most notably associated with the work of John Cage and Philip Glass, whose work contains elements of chance and randomness.

The exhibition Kinetic Art Rejoice spans the twentieth century and opens at the","

The art of movement, some call it dance, and others call it kinetic art, has a storied history in the twentieth century and is perhaps most well-known in the work of Marcel Duchamp, whose 1917 urinal “Readymades” was arguably the first kinetic artwork. The art grew in popularity throughout the next two decades, with a peak in the 1960s and 1970s when artists like Brian Eno, Terry Fox, and David Bowie all embraced the medium and incorporated it into their work. Eno’s “Tom Verdonck” (1967) is perhaps the most well-known kinetic artwork today, a video of Tom Verdonck dancing to the music of Brian Eno, although the artist himself does not appear to be moving a muscle. While the art of movement became a major influence of the 1960s counterculture movement, it was also something of a victim of its own success, especially with the emergence of computer generated imagery and the virtual reality revolution.

Today, however, kinetic art remains a vibrant form of contemporary art and sculpture that is still highly experimental and unique to both the medium and the art world. This is most notably exemplified in London’s Hayward Gallery — where an ex-armory transformed into an exhibit space where visitors can see what might be the only public display of the art of movement to date. The transformation is almost seamless, with the exhibit spanning a series of diagonally hung rooms where it’s"," In the gallery’s heyday, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the movement was different: there was a flourishing of artists who used specially-made metal rods called ‘Kinetic Orgasms’, which when activated (by a small electrical mechanism) made abstract shapes and images leap into being, often moving seemingly at random through the air.  The works of this wave of artists — who are largely unknown today — include fantastical structures made from nothing more than rods of various materials and diameters, such as one called ‘Mathematics of Love’, which seems to be made from the pulsing orifices of the Kinetic Orgasms themselves.    
  But the art of movement, it seems, had come full circle by the 1980s, as the media became more sophisticated, the technology more complex and, crucially, cheaper. The art of movement became less exciting and less innovative, devolving into what Kinetic Orgasms artist and curator Michael Petry (who has curated the new exhibition) calls ‘the endless loop of repetition’.  

The exhibition consists of a selection of works from the 1960s to the present, showing how the art of movement had a varied and inspiring history, from the structural complexity of one of Kinetic Orgasms’s most enduring and popular pieces to the dizzying imagery and movement of one of its less well-known artists. There are also several videos of the works in motion.  
"," Its highlights include Salvador Dali’s erotic dance of the flesh, Jean Tinguely’s “frieze of falling clocks”, Nam June Paik’s “ kinetic sculptures” and, of course, the Hayward Gallery’s recent redesign into a spectacular open-air museum of moving sculptures. This is a delightful and entertaining exhibition, full of delightful and entertaining curiosities. It is the story of the modernist movement to make kinetic art a fashionable branch of art. But there is more to kinetic art than just the obvious eroticism of Dali’s dancers; the sculptures are beautifully and thoughtfully rendered. This is a fascinating, well-researched show which tells us something of the history of kinetic art and the important role the Hayward Gallery played in transforming that history. The curators, Alastair Birrell and Simon Hulme, do a credit to the Gallery. They have researched the subject competently and delivered a well-presented exhibition. The Hayward’s staff have worked hard too, and the exhibition has an almost utopian feeling to it, where the work of artists who don’t matter much seems to be celebrated and the ones who do have their work made available to the general public for free, a privilege extended to the public at large to join the Hayward’s community of visitors. There are plenty of videos and images on the exhibition’s website if you want to immerse yourself more fully in the subject.","

The exhibition is divided into two parts. Part one is devoted to the first twenty years of the century: 1960 to 1970. Its central part shows films and photographs taken by the famous German photographer and cinematographer Robert Doppelgänger (aka, Helmut Newton) and his wife, Barbara. These document the development of what are known today as “kinetic art” and “performance art” in Germany. Doppelgänger and Newton would become key figures in the development of this new artistic movement, which challenged the prevailing aesthetics of the era and became synonymous with the expression “new thinking.”

Part two of the exhibition, and the highlight, is devoted to the 1970s. The main part shows footage of several performance events which take place in the second half of the decade: The first, at the end of 1971 at the Dial House in London, is a filmic reading of the poems “Song of the Shadows” by the Welsh-language poet Rhian Lewis; the second is a video recording of the American artist Joseph Kosuth’s “Fire in the Can” at the Hayward in 1972; and the third event is a filmic reading of the poems “The Flower of Killarney” by the Irish poet Seán O’Casey. These three events make up what has been dubbed “The Happening.” The exhibition concludes with a short interview with Kosuth and a selection of his works.

Read"," It’s an exploration of works ranging from the haptic explorations of early Fluxus to the futuristic ephemera of Julian Opie, which have all been re-contextualised and re-introduced into the gallery space, giving the viewer — in all senses — a truly magical experience.

Which is why, perhaps surprisingly, the show has been met with a cool reception. A mixture of bored resignation and bemusement. But this seems like a misguided position to take, given the undeniable power of the works on display: the beauty of movement, the sheer mesmerising aesthetics of all things physical.

Certainly one couldn’t help but admire the ambition and creativity of Opie’s “Project Flesh” installation, an enormous life-size, full-motion, virtual reality theatre. In this theatre, Opie — a digital media artist and founder of the Virtual Human Research Foundation — has programmed a live human voice to act out a full range of human emotions and physical actions, performing actions as natural as it gets — lifting a coffee to his lips, for example, with uncanny lifelike detail. (Even more impressive is the uncanny physical similarity between the actor and Opie himself: one wonders if this is not some sort of meta-viral avatar of Julian Opie.)

The sheer visual spectacle of Opie’s work can be overwhelming: the massive, full-motion, 360-degree projections of “Project"," Starting with Marcel Duchamp’s urinal and continuing through the most prominent practitioners of the genre of the 1970s right up to the present day, this is a compelling exhibition, if a little on the superficial side. Not only does it cover the ground that is most necessary to get an overview of the evolution of the form, but it is, paradoxically, highly formulaic. The most intriguing work features a series of large screens suspended from the ceiling, each featuring a unique cinematic projection (usually a loop) of moving images of people and animals, many of which appear to be being shot. The project’s curator, David Fleming, has described the exhibit as a retrospective of “the people and the work who were the first to show that movement could be a medium in itself and that the moving image could become a living thing”. It’s a clever play on a well-trodden theme, but at some points feels less like a tour of the genre’s canonical moments than the work of a single director who is more interested in establishing a sense of historical context than exploring its deeper merits. Still, there’s much to enjoy in this wide-ranging exploration of one of the most influential, and least-read, forms of modern art.

" Paul Simon's songbooks included the following chart busters including ""Graceland"" and ""So Small"". The latter remains the biggest selling debut single of all time. ""Graceland"" gave rise to the so-called ""glam rock"" movement. This is the story of Paul Simon and the rock and roll he made famous.

  * Paul Simon formed a rock band in the 1950s and recorded some of the biggest selling debut singles of all time including ""So Small"". This song and the chart busters ""Graceland"" and ""So Small"" led to the so-called ""glam rock"" movement.

  * The ""Graceland"" video featured the band playing to an adoring crowd at a gospel concert where many people left the auditorium in tears.

  * Simon was inspired by gospel artists such as Mahalia Jackson and Aretha Franklin.

  * The ""So Small"" video was recorded in an abandoned synagogue and featured Simon playing the piano while the synagogue is destroyed by fire.

  * Simon was born in New Jersey and moved to the Southside of Chicago as a child. He attended the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana where he took a keen interest in the Rhythm and Blues movement. He formed a rock band in the 1950s and recorded some of the biggest selling debut singles of all time including ""So Small"".

  * Simon wrote ""Graceland"" during a vacation in"," In 1957 Little Richard released his first single ‘My Name is Alexander’. It was a hit and to this day can be heard on late night TV or at football stadiums the world over. When Simon and Garfunkel first heard the record they thought Little Richard had recorded the song and they were mystified. It turns out that Paul Simon had seen the hit as a teenager at Woolton's Bowlka factory when the worker had played it to pump up the workers for a night shift. Simon and Garfunkel were blown away that their song had inspired this major artist. Little Richard, the teen who grew up to be a superstar, had been listening to Simon and Garfunkel’s rock and roll classic ‘graceland’ which he adored back in the day. This is how the concept of cultural appropriation came about. The point is, rock and roll and Paul Simon and Garfunkel's song ‘graceland’ had a seismic impact on a teenage listener's life and therefore on the culture. 

Paul Simon’s song is an example of a pop classic from the 1950s which continues to have a substantial cultural impact on society today. In order to write a story about cultural impact using the prompt above, it is helpful to understand what a cultural impact is. The OED defines cultural impact as ‘the alteration in the habits, attitudes, opinions, or way of life of a people resulting from contact with a foreign element’. 

In other words"," While Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones were the most famous examples of the mid century teen idol's song-and-dance hall of fame performances, countless others - including the Beatles - built on Simon's template, albeit in more subtle ways. In the UK alone, the Fifties were graced with the likes of the Spinners, the Shadows, the Fendermen and many more. 

One man who was to have a decisive impact on the evolution of rock music was Jeff Marx. His first professional act was as part of the Spiders from Mars, the rhythm-section of whom became known as the Tones. A move to EMI-Isle of Man saw the group's fortunes rise, and the debut album of the Tones was the first to cross the threshold of number 10 in the UK charts. 

Moving into a solo career after leaving the Tones, Jeff was to prove himself a star in his own right. Releasing the album The Jeff Marx Discs in 1957, it was an immediate success, making it to number 3 in the UK charts. It's the album's jazzier tracks that have found the most acclaim, but it's a diverse and entertaining set that saw the saxophonist work with many leading names from the music business, from Billy Cotton and Frank Ifield to the Shadows and the Ventures. It also saw him introduce an element of flair to the role of the rock '"," 

Paul Simon was a rock icon and singer-songwriter born in the South Sampalita Hills area of Kensington, California on April 12, 1949.  Simon had two siblings, a younger brother and a sister.  

Simon first gained recognition for the 1964 song, ""Twist of Fate"" which hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.  The song would go on to sell over 6 million copies and be awarded the Grammy Award for Record of the Year.  This success spawned a hit album and album of Simon's same style of music, original compositions mixed with covers of previous songs.

It was not until the release of 1970's GRAMMY Nominated LP 'Paul Simon is' that Simon truly established himself as a rock icon,  particularly with the tracks ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" and ""50 Ways to Leave Yourself.""  These two tracks made it on to the U.S. Billboard charts and became popular international songs that were played on Radio all over the world.  These tracks would go on to be covered by many of the top artists in the world today and are regularly played on Adult Contemporary radio.

Paul Simon was voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.  In 2002 he was awarded the Kennedy Center Honors which are presented to living Americans who have made outstanding contributions to the arts.  

Paul Simon today lives in Los Angeles with his family."," 

The story continues: 

Rock and roll was a teenage obsession of the 1950s and many of the great performers were teenagers of the time. In 1955 Elvis Presley scored his first hit record with ""Love Me Tender"". By 1958 Little Richard had scored a second hit record with ""Let me take you for a ride"". Buddy Holly and the other members of The Crickets scored their first hit in 1957. The Beatles, comprising four teenagers, burst on to the music scene in 1960 with the hit single ""Love Me Do"". 

In the decades that followed many of these teenagers became popular musicians, artists, songwriters and actors. Although rock and roll fizzled out and went into decline in the 1960s its seismic impact was realised by the 1970s. In that decade Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly became symbols of youthful rebellion and their music and lives were lionised in both art and popular culture. 

In the 1980s The Beatles returned to the limelight as the new generation of rock stars. Some of the artists who emerged in the decade, including the Spice Girls and David Bowie, drew inspiration from the Beatles, as did a whole generation of new musicians who were influenced by rock and roll. 

Although rock and roll was not a perfect cultural mix, it was a powerful agent for cultural change and has to be credited as one of the defining cultural movements of the 20th century.


Buddy Holly and the other members"," 

This was the early 60’s and the fledgling rock and roll movement was in its infancy with a few hits and a few albums to its name.  Rock and roll in the 1950s, released in 1957, was an unlikely musical phenomenon.  It was a unique combination of simplicity, catchiness, and heartfelt lyrics (all of which have since proven over and over to be essential to the genre’s appeal).  Many credit the hit “My Little Home in the West” with launching the band into international stardom, and the song’s infectious refrain “You don’t realize how fast things change” gave the album its name.  Simon and Garfunkel were 19 years old when they recorded it and the album (which was co-produced by Art Garfunkel’s brother Paul)  peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard charts.  In its first year of release, it went into the bookstores of record stores and rock stations everywhere and would later be certified diamond, the highest sales award.   

Despite the album’s immense success, there was a darker side to its reception.  The song “Simon’sCeiling” had been banned by the military for containing references to suicide.  Its followup single “Scarborough Fair”, while a bigger hit, was similarly challenged for its cultural commentary on modernity, youth culture, and what it means to be an American in the 1950’s","


The story starts with a short prologue that sets the scene of the 1950's, rock and roll music and its rise to fame. The story then introduces us to the protagonist Paul Simon, who is a child of the middle class, who, much to his chagrin, has been attracted to the counter-culture and listening to rock and roll. He soon realises that rock and roll has a seismic impact on the middle class, inspiring them to seek out new music and a different lifestyle and leading them towards purchasing large scale rock records. He continues to listen to rock and roll records on repeat to the point of fatigue and develops a complex relationship with his parents as they struggle to comprehend his change of heart and seek to influence his musical choices. The story ends with Paul's discovery of Jimi Hendrix's ""All Along The Watchtower"", a track widely known for its haunting riffs and message of change and renewal, and his subsequent move to the suburbs to pursue a new, more conventional life.

There is a pattern of eminence that emerges from the writings of the early Poets. It begins with Homer and then moves through the Alexanders, Virgils and Bysses and culminates with Lord Byron in the 19th century. There have been a number of minor poets since then but no one has successfully broken into the upper levels of the literary empyrean and that seems to have changed with the publication of the poems of Philip Larkin at the end of the 20th century.

HOMER
Homer is known from the Iliad and Odyssey, two epic poems detailing the Greek cause in the Trojan War. His themes include the hardships and sufferings of war, the beauty of nature, the dangers of pursuing pleasure, and the universal human struggle for happiness.

- born about 235 B.C. at Babylon in what is now Iraq, Alexander the Great was a renowned general, conqueror, and philosopher. The most notable achievement of his reign was the capture of most of Greece"," – Ernest Heminway 

In 600 B.C. Greece was experiencing a time of turmoil as a result of numerous political changes and uprisings throughout the known world.  However, one of the most significant events to occur that year would lead to the foundation of the Trojan War.  Homer, a renowned and legendary bard from the city of Ithaca in the west of Greece, wrote the “Iliad” which tells the story of the first book in the series of “Heroes.”  

The story begins with a chorus of male warrior’s singing an introductory ode to the Trojan War, and these warriors come from many of the major Greek city-states.  Homer’s words tell of the courage of the Greek soldiers and their resolve to drive the Trojans from a certain point called “Troy.”  The Trojans, however, remained entrenched at their point of concentration.  The Achaean soldiers prepare to storm the Trojan position.  Hector, the prince of the Trojans, and one of the greatest warriors of his time, commands the Achaean army, and they sing the well-known chorus, “Pour Homère,” in reference to their faith in the words of Homer as they prepare for battle. 

The Trojans are not ready to be driven from their ground.  The Achaean soldiers prepare for a siege and a bloody battle.  ","

The poetical scene","

  In a previous age, there was a group of poets called the Spenserian School. It is believed that they were associated with the University of Oxford. Spenser's name is usually thought to refer to Edmund Spenser, though this is debatable. The Spenserian School was active during the Elizabethan age of English Literature and produced many important poets including Edmund Spenser, John Milton, William Shakespeare, Alexander Smith, Edmund Pugh and George Herbert.  This group were more concerned with the beautify of everyday words than with the flowery rhetoric of more lyrical poets such as Sidney and Surrey.

  One of the most famous Spenserian Poets was John Milton. He was a very learned man and wrote a treatise on the history of English law. Milton's poem entitled Paradise Lost, published in 1671, is considered by many to be his masterpiece. It is a satirical poem about the fall of man and the struggle for existence in a world without God. The poem contains detailed allusions to the history of Ancient Greece and Rome as well as Biblical allusions.  There is some debate about whether Paradise Lost was originally written in Latin or English. The poem is divided into two parts. The first part relates the creation of the world, man's Fall into sin, and the story of Adam and Eve. The second part of the poem contains a brief but detailed account of the journey of man from the creation to","

POETRY RECITALS The following is a sample from Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind”: 

Tiresias, to the wind, I know
That thou among other powers art mild,
I hear the breath of thy sweet face,
Thou mak’st the buds think spring will have him,
The linnet builds his nest
Where never storm hath been;
Dost thou not call the clouds back?
Do thou the red blood warm,
Dost thou not drive the frost away?
Oh, answer, thou God mild!

" During childhood if a child cries for long periods it is a signal that it needs adult attention, but it also needs to feel safe. Research has shown that children who are routinely allowed to cry are more likely to grow up to be empathetic, compassionate people. On a more basic level crying is a mechanism which evolved as a form of 'disinfection'.  Crying prevents your pores from being irritated by chemicals such as sweat and perspiration. Crying also reduces your surface temperature. If a baby is cold and wet there is less heat lost and they can maintain a lower body temperature. This is a mechanism which helps to conserve energy during times of stress and danger. There is also growing evidence that childhood crying helps to lower blood pressure, however this is only true for babies under 6 months of age. One can speculate whether our obsession with crying is related to the fact that babies make the largest number of tears. Research has shown that crying releases endorphins into the bloodstream, and that endorphins have a calming effect. Endorphins also have a 'feel good' effect.

Fibromyalgia Syndrome, Depression and Headaches
https://www.thehealerpublishing.com/fibromyalgia-"," However this is not true for all infants. Some are capable of smiling for the first time in their lives, when they see a female relative they don't know. They do so without prior preparation, they haven't been told to or shown any examples of smiling. Smiling turns out to be a learned behaviour that is often triggered by their mothers when they are hungry or in discomfort. So although crying is a natural and often healthy emotion, there is a learned aspect to it. It is also clear to many that crying is harmful to babies at times when they might otherwise be cared for by their mothers and are therefore more likely to be comforted and get the appropriate nutrition. We can all thank Charles Darwin for teaching us that the evolution of crying was none of his business.


In 1871 Charles Darwin published his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. The book made the claim that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolutionary purpose. Darwin, however, was no biology expert and many now think that he was incredibly misguided in making this statement. In particular, we now think that children tend to cry when they are in distress for a number of reasons. For example, they may have lost their mother or another carer and so need to contact her or another adult for comfort. They may also need comfort themselves and so are engaging in a behaviour that will help them feel better. It is also possible that they haven't been well looked after or have witnessed other babies"," When children fail at an activity they may become upset and cry. Tears can also signal a relief that an unpleasant situation has passed and comfort can then be restored.

One hypothesis is that humans express their emotions through cries as a way to share important information and as a form of bonding with one’s immediate social network. Research suggests that cries are also an effective way for an infant to get adult attention when they are not ready for a more physical interaction. One reason why crying is important for human development is that it teaches the child to manage their feelings and cope with difficult situations.


In conclusion crying allows us to share our feelings with those we care about, express our feelings effectively, learn to manage our feelings and receive emotional support from those we love.


Which of the following is most consistent with Darwin’s opinion on the evolutionary significance of human crying? 

A. Darwin was almost certainly wrong. 

B. Tears play an important role in human development by teaching children to manage their feelings and receive emotional support. 

C. Crying is an effective way for an infant to get adult attention when they are not ready for a more physical interaction.


In favour of A: Darwin was almost certainly wrong. In favour of B: Tears play an important role in human development by teaching children to manage their feelings and receive emotional support. In favour of C: Crying is an effective way for an infant to get adult attention when they are not"," As a species we have learned how to survive and so have lost our need to cry. This means we may never again be able to shed real tears. However, the fact that the ability to cry has become less pronounced does not mean it is not still useful. Modern medicine may not require us to shed tears but it does require us to express our emotions. A study by researchers at the University of California Los Angeles determined that a network of small tears running throughout the skin layer of the eye was more important than the actual tears themselves. They concluded that the presence of small tears indicated that a user was not emotionally numb. On the contrary, these small tears proved that the user experienced genuine emotions. In short, humans may no longer cry as a species, but small tears can still be shed.

Rather, the presence of the breast stimulates the production of prolactin which leads to both increased milk production and milk secretion. This may help explain why the babies of breast feeding mothers tend to cry less than the babies of mothers who do not breastfeed.

Citing this answer, you can write a story about the evolution of crying as a social behavior.

A baby who is breastfed tends to cry less than the baby of a mother who does not breastfeed. This is because breastfeeding promotes the production of prolactin which helps with both increased milk production and milk secretion. Babies who are breastfed are likely to cry less because of their sense of helplessness stimulated by the presence of the breast. The babies of breast feeding mothers who are also breastfed tend to cry less than the babies of non-breastfeeding mothers. This is because they do not need to have an understanding of their mother’s helplessness in order to cry.

"," In evolutionary terms, crying may have helped a baby alert its care-givers to immediate needs. There is certainly evidence to show that babies look to their parents for help more if they can make eye contact, which crying cannot achieve. Babies often cry uncontrollably for up to a week following a separation. It is thought that the development of the immune and stress systems are stimulated by crying, which in turn helps to develop the bond. Studies have shown that the sound of mother’s crying promotes the survival of bacteria in the gut, and stress hormones increase production of antibody-producing B cells. A baby’s ability to control crying is related to the volume of crying as well as the duration. Control over crying is achieved within several days, although some babies may have to wait until they are three or four months old. Babies who can control crying by 3-4 months of age show greater immune system response and also have stronger memories of the content of their caregivers’ voices. In summary, Darwin’s theory did not account for the evolution of our tendency to cry.

Darwin had thought that humans cried at an almost infinite number of occasions for no obvious reason. Science has since shown this to be untrue and that crying is an extremely efficient method of communicating our feelings. Science writer Sally McMillan goes as far as to say that human tears are ""the universal language"". The article includes a scientific citation and a link to more information.

In your own words, what exactly happens when you “publicly check-in” anywhere?

Use this example: “I’m at Starbucks, over there in the corner.” 
When you “publicly check-in” anywhere, you are telling everyone that you are available in that area – and you are advertising that you are likely to be at the location. 
It’s important to distinguish between public – and private – check-ins. You probably don’t want to tell everyone where you live, or where you’re going to the bathroom! “Over there in the corner” might work if it’s a private area, but not if you want to be able to get to a bathroom without running into other people. 

As an example of a public announcement, “I’m at Starbucks!” might work well. “I’m at Starbucks, and I’ll be here for the next few minutes” might not – but it would be considered a private announcement. “I’m at Starbucks! I’m having a latte!” would be a clear public announcement.

So why does this matter? Public check-ins matter in several situations:
* Your boss might check-in your whereabouts to people who you might not want to share a personal phone number to, in order to get work done.
* Someone might “check-in” your location to your friend who you haven’t talked to"," I’ve been tempted by the convenience of check-ins in the past – but now I realise what a public relations disaster they are. I’ve now been using my phone’s GPS to help me find my way around town. I’ve installed Waze, an open-source app, which helps show me the shortest way around my current location to pretty much any point I choose. It even offers a history of where I’ve been and whether I’ve been along the good or the wrong ways. That is, until a few weeks ago, when a website caught on to my usage and decided to put an ad on my publicly-visible online profile that I’d better remove. I have no control over the website’s content, of course. They can say what they like. But what I do control is whether I’m going to let a random website bully me into removing an ad for the simple reason that it has an ad. And so I told the world: (more…)

It’s National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) which means that thousands of people around the world are attempting to write a 50-page novel in a month. Some people succeed. Most fail.

Sanderson completed NaNoWriMo and now says he may write another book now that he has finished his first novel","  

So, I recently started posting my whereabouts on my blog. I know, I know – it’s your typical self-promotion, but I’m not here to sell you anything: just to share! And yes, I do get a few sales and meet a few great people. But mostly I just like to share and get feedback. 

What are your thoughts?

You might like to add: I think it's a great idea!
You might not like to add: I think people should be able to take public check-ins for a hike any day.
You might like to add: If you look around the world, people usually do want to advertise where they are and what they are doing. You should think about the people around you, and decide whether public check-ins are a good idea for you.

Your point of view

Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts.


The website’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into.


So, I recently started posting my whereabouts on my blog. I know, I know – it’s your typical self-promotion, but I’m not"," 

Explanation: This story focuses on the concept of public vs. private. In today’s world, we share information about where we are (public) but also allow companies to post information about where we are going (public), and more rarely, confessing where we are (private). This story reflects these trends by presenting a public announcement of being at a place as advertising to other people everywhere, but the author argues that the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.

Argument: Confessing to the world. A website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world ‘Hey I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into.

In today’s world, we share information about where we are (public) but also allow companies to post information about where you are going (public), and more rarely, confessing where we are (private). This story reflects these trends by presenting a public announcement of being at a place as advertising to other people everywhere, but the author argues that the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.

Evidence: The website highlighted the risks of public check-ins: you may think you are just"," I confess I had this happen to me recently. I was at a place for which I had an excellent track-record of getting to relatively regularly – except this time I was unable to locate the spot in a public place. This was partly because it was a bank holiday (I usually don’t get to places during bank holidays!) and partly because I didn’t realise my smartphone had location services on. The latter was no fault of mine, since my battery died in the middle of the night and my iPhone had been lying around the house all day so that in the event of a power-cut I would be able to find my way to the Apple store. So I had left my iPhone in the kitchen drawer when I went to bed. And the next morning when I needed to find my house I had forgotten all about my phone. I could have called a friend and asked them to look up the address of my house on their phone, but what was the point? It was too late to backtrack; my destination was not listed on any mapping website. I had to hope that when the time came someone would remember that I like to frequently check-in at this spot. And they did. Someone left me an ‘app’ on Facebook that showed me where this was. I don’t have Facebook. I can’t install it! I could have run home to find my phone, retrieve the app and – thanks to Facebook’s ‘like’ button – re-run"," You are also committing a privacy violation. You may think your check-ins are limited to ‘just my phone’, but your device may also send these public announcements to nearby mobile phones – or to your personal computer and to an airport wifi network. In any case, the general public now has access to this information. While I like to think of myself as an individual who chooses to limit my public announcements, I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who does that. I think it’s time to stop worrying about whether my public announcements might get out and just do it. So, am I going to start public checking in?  

Public announcements are becoming a mainstream practice, as more and more people decide to ‘check-in’ on where they are and do. This has been fueled by smartphone usage and, more recently, social media. The idea of being seen and being approachable, of marketing oneself to others, is something we are all inclined to embrace and practice. And, in the digital age, this information is freely available and easily accessible. But if you are concerned about the implications of public announcements, you might want to consider what the implications of your public announcements are. To the individual or organization you are announcing to, your public announcements may be a privacy violation. While it is hard to convince someone to advertise a location to millions of people, someone might decide you shouldn’t get a public-ado-ciation prize for sharing such a personal"," And you have no control over who might see your check-ins. To try to keep myself out of trouble I started my check-ins with places I know well, to a much smaller audience – the kind of people I tend to bump into on a daily basis. But then, on a whim, I added another destination to my post. It’s a local favourite of mine, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it listed on the check-in. Before I knew it, I found myself on the receiving end of a stream of strange and unexpected reactions to my out-of-town travels. I can’t say I’m a hundred percent surprised, but I’d like to think I’m less bothered than before. And it was all because I was (ahem) public about my travels. It was only when I started putting your name, instead of my own, in front of the destination that the ire of potential stalkers began to subside. Maybe you could get into the same kind of trouble? And what happens when you don’t even realise you’ve published your itinerary to a broader audience? You never know who may be reading your blog (or scrolling past you on a mobile screen), and who may take an instant dislike to you. But that, I guess, is the power of the internet for us all.

" Our relationship with food should be as elemental as fire and oxygen. We should be able to light a fire by simply gathering enough materials that would normally be discarded. And we should be able to eat with ease and relish by simply chewing and swallowing. The problem starts when we get into the kitchen; once we put the materials together and start preparing our feast. First there is the usual preamble of 'I need...', 'Well, if I can get together...', 'I think we can manage...', 'This will probably need more than one person...', 'There may be one ingredient or foodstuff we haven't thought of...', 'There is a fair chance we will get it wrong...', 'This is a lot of work...', 'I'm not sure I can do this...', 'Perhaps it would be easier if I did it this way instead...', 'Oh dear, we're down to the last packet of biscuits and they are not eating well these days so let's see if there is anything left in the cupboard....'. Once everything is in place and it is time to cook, there is the problem of heating up everything and, once it is all hot, there is the problem of clearing up; or not doing either of those things, or something similar. And once our feast is on the table there is the problem of eating. I suppose we could go back over all of the ingredients one more time, perhaps, just to make sure we"," However, in reality we should be making, preparing and eating good food every day. It not only sustains us it is the source of a great deal of joy and excitement. We are what we eat and so a lack of nutritional value or taste is not necessarily a reason to abstain it. So as the new school year begins and the start of the holiday season approaches it would be wise to make a point to make eating well a regular practice. In doing so we will create lifelong friends and family who are full of love and joy and care for and nourish us. I think you will agree this is a worthy cause to strive for!


The story should introduce a special day when eating well became important to the character, with a few hints of the underlying reason. This can be through an anecdote from a loved one, or by mentioning an article or blog post the character has read. The piece can also discuss the character's own experiences with cooking good meals and learning about how food has an underlying impact on our mental health and overall wellbeing. The final point can be made about the benefits of making eating well a daily practice, for example by mentioning the fact that it creates lifelong friends and family, who care for and nourish us.


Food provides us with something very primal and natural, something we instinctively understand and connect with. We need not become chefs and spend thousands of dollars and the time to prepare exquisite meals. By simply making good food a habit and"," The first course of the afternoon is a simple salad made from the garden herbs which you have so thoughtfully grown from your organic allotment. There is a great deal of satisfaction to be had from sitting down to a well prepared meal and being able to see the food from start to finish. I think that the hardest part of food preparation is making the first cut in order to get at the good stuff. If you don't mind the odd knife cut your hand while chopping onions at the start of a long journey. When the meal is cooked you have to inspect the dish from top to bottom. The eyes are the best barometer of the quality of food and the final reward for a well prepared dish is experiencing the full flavour of the ingredients. There are few things more exhilarating than eating fresh fish and chips. And you can make such great use of those little pebbles you have lying around your allotment. It took a lot of will-power to resist the offer of one of the elder-tree's berries. That said it will always taste better than a gin and tonic so I resisted the temptation. 

Your story should start with the text “Food” in all capitals, followed by a short paragraph explaining that food, if prepared well, is one of life's great pleasures. Then describe the different tasks involved in preparing a meal. Finally, contrast preparing a meal with inspecting a cooked dish from top to bottom.


Sample text
"," Yet the act of preparing food is something that brings people of all ages and classes close and it can have a powerful positive effect on the social fabric. This can be seen at schools where a small group of people all sit down together to enjoy a meal (more on this shortly). I imagine that for many people who grew up in the 70s and 80s there is no greater joy than preparing a meal for friends, family or a special occasion. This is often done in the knowledge that there is a good chance they may find themselves at the head of the table. Cooking is also something that brings families together, both on Sundays when the family gathers around the table for Sunday lunch and during the week when friends can grab a meal on the go. Often preparing and eating food is how we bond as a family and spending time together doing so is something to which many cultures ascribe importance. In the UK we have an interesting mix of cuisines and while this can sometimes feel like an embarrassment of riches we must never lose sight of the fact that we are, after all, just preparing and eating food. In the US the phrase ""eating dinner"" has a whole other connotation. There is also something very special about the knowledge that when we get a plate of food we are preparing and eating together as a family. As adults we might take pride in our ability to cook but as children preparing food together was something that had a special kind of magic about it. As a child"," Yet I firmly believe that if you love to cook it is largely because you enjoy the simple pleasure of preparing food, the satisfaction of presenting something nutritious and delicious for your family to enjoy. Even if you only ever cook once a week, perhaps for Sunday lunch, make it a point to attempt that week night meal that has eluded you - and give your family the pleasure of a home-cooked meal. A simple pasta dish can be so satisfying and a family dinner is the very essence of a home - whether it is on an oiled surface or one full of cushions and candles. 

Food can be so simple. It can also be so beautiful. It can even be so delicious that you get a little teary eyed when you eat it. Cooking food for your family is a joy. Eating home-cooked food is a feeling that cannot be replicated by any other medium. 

The simple pleasure of cooking food should be celebrated - if for no other reason than that the world would be a duller place without it.

A2 readers will enjoy this book because it contains beautiful photography of beautiful food. The recipes contained in the book are delicious and definitely worth a try. It is an excellent read for those who enjoy travel and photography.


Food has a lot of power. The simple pleasure of cooking food can be the very basis of a family unit. It brings people together, creates memories and is a way of honoring the food that"," I have found that the easiest way to eat well is to make sure you are eating well for basic reasons: that your body is healthy and strong; that you are able to relax, perhaps with a glass of wine or a cigarette; that you don’t feel that you are straining to produce a particularly impressive array of platters and platters of food. To be clear - it is not about eating to impress or feeling that you have to be doing it with style; it is rather that the very act of eating allows you to become physically and emotionally less stressed and therefore allows yourself and those around you to also relax. It also allows you to consume more calories than you would if you did not eat. All this to say - don’t feel shy about having that nice bowl of pasta or serving up a pie after work.  A little bit of this and a little bit of that can really help in keeping your weight where you want it and your health where it should be.

	*"," It can be a frustrating experience for those of us who like to attempt new things without undue expectation and it can actually be quite depressing when you set out to do something and simply don't have the energy or ingredients to make it.  So that is why I was really quite surprised when, on Friday afternoon, I came home to find a well presented plate of freshly caught haddock, new potatoes, parsnips and turnip greens sitting in the centre of the table for my colleagues to share.  And they were quite rightly raving about how delicious it had been. And in fact, during the two and a half hours it took for the meal to prepare I actually finished most of the vegetables  which had been in my fridge ready to go in the pot.  And not just the turnip greens which were actually quite sour and a little overpowering, but the parsnips which seemed like a good candidate for a new dish but were entirely too large, the potatoes which had actually had an infection and were a little under par and the parsnip which I had intended to use but had put off in case they looked a bit undercooked.  So basically the dish that had been on the table for two hours and in which most of us had participated was quite spectacular. I can honestly say that we ate it without enthusiasm and with only the odd token compliment. In fact some of us actually moaned that the fish was cold.  And that is why I find it so"
" They are known to smoke and drink (even if only at night). The average kitchen life is one of stress and pressure. When I decided to become a chef I was naive - I didn't know what I was getting into. 

The chef's life was hard work but I still wasn't sure I was cut out for it. I had always loved cooking but never got round to doing any specialised courses so didn't realise what a challenge my chosen profession would be. 

My family were all astonished that I had chosen to become a chef. My friends thought I was mad. I ignored all their warnings. I signed up for a 3 year course. 

Once I had started my training I discovered that I made very good progress. My work ethic increased and I began to enjoy the process of cooking. 

The first few years of my course were very hard. Learning the trade was a challenge. But I persevered. 

I enjoyed my friends and family but found the isolation of the kitchen was hardest to adjust to. It became increasingly apparent that I wasn't cut out for the life. 

But in my heart I knew that I just loved cooking and enjoyed the challenge of the trade. I just needed to find my niche. 

When I graduated I was determined to do something else but I knew that I had only just begun. 

I had made the right choice. 

The Kitchen is a wonderful place to work. It's exciting"," It is also very stressful with no guarantees of staying at the top of your profession for long. 

It's true that chefs do get very highly paid for the work they do, however that is not the only reason why people go into this field. Chefs get to use their best tool: their kitchen. They get to use their ingenuity and imagination, to turn the raw ingredients they have access to into a finished dish. It is also worth mentioning the social side of this job. In addition to the hard work, chefs get to hang out with celebrities, enjoy the night life and socialise with their peers. 

The truth is that not everyone wants to become a chef. But it's also true that more people do than may initially think. There are a number of reasons for this:
1. Cooking is inherently a feminine job. Men feel uncomfortable in kitchens; chefs also enjoy a certain amount of power and control over their surroundings. As one chef I know put it ""you cannot be a good chef unless you feel like a female in a man's world"". This is not just a matter of stereotype. 

2. There are more women in education than men. Men are generally the bread winners for a family, and in most households the role of bread winner is done by a woman. In my house that role is taken by my mother who is a fantastic cook. When it comes to education, women seem to respond better to career paths which"," In our profession we also pride ourselves on an often gruelling regime of hard work, long hours and deprivation. The life of a chef is no bed of roses: the temptations to drink and drugs are too great. 

However, in the three years I was in the kitchen I fell head over heels in love with it. It is a world of culinary delights: the aromas, the scents, the flavour of the foods you can prepare and the pleasure of spending time with friends and family is transformed. In the three years I was a chef I fell in love with the job. So much so that when I finally left university with a degree in the subject I did so with regret. For some time afterwards I toyed with the idea of becoming a chef. It was only when I started getting job applications for work interviews that I realised I had wasted three years of my life. In the end I rejected these offers, because after all had I learned? What have I actually achieved in that time? I haven't learned to kill or cut up humans in my workplace. I haven't learned to use sharp knives or work in a dirty kitchen. I haven't become a better chef, just a better-paid one. 

So while a life of a chef may not be an unattractive choice, it really isn't one either. It may not be what you have imagined a life in the culinary arts to be, but don't be fooled. It is more"," In exchange, however, chefs enjoy certain privileges that their colleagues in other trades do not have. For example, they do not have to do the unpleasant jobs - such as cleaning up after their colleagues who have eaten - that other professions prevent them from performing. Chefs also tend to live longer than other professionals. In addition, they enjoy a level of status that is perhaps unique to them. Although my university had very few students who were actually professional chefs, all of them seemed to know each other and were a close-knit group. This is perhaps understandable as a profession that does not pay particularly well must attract a certain level of philistinism into its membership. To me, this has been one of the attractions of the profession. It allows me to be creative. But there is a price to pay for the privilege of being a professional cook. As a chef you have access to a source of food that is unlimited in quantity and variety. At first I would go to restaurants to study the menu. I would look at photos of various dishes on the plate and mentally order my own menu. It was very exciting and I would get all hot and flustered in anticipation of my foray into culinary creation. But there was a catch. As time passed, I learned to control my excitement and prepare myself for the reality that I would likely never achieve the perfection of the dish on the photograph. It never quite came off the plate or into the dining room with the same exact combination of"," The hours are long, and you live with the constant fear that something may go wrong: a burning stove, a burst pipe, a cat in the kitchen... But then, I think, you are constantly solving problems, and making fast, difficult decisions. So, I decided to give it a go. It turned out that I am very much drawn to the profession. I love cooking; I love the preparation and the taste of food. Most importantly, I love to be in the kitchen. It is a very inspiring room. The smell of fresh bread and baking fills the house. Cooking is a team game. You are constantly in contact with other members of the kitchen staff; they are constantly working alongside you. You feel useful, valued, and a part of something bigger than yourself. I love being a chef. But I also love other aspects of the kitchen too. The practicality, the engineering of the machines, and the creativity that goes into building new and better stoves. I am quite drawn to the allure of the kitchen. It is a place of opportunity, of great responsibility, and of personal fulfilment. I love the fact that it can both be a prison and a haven. I think chefs should be paid more for what they do, and for the important contribution they make to society. It is a profession that should be supported and encouraged. And yes, I am fully aware that it is a man's world. I am also aware of the great strides that"," They often live in tiny, poky, windowless rooms which are cold and damp, with the sounds and smells of the kitchen providing the only company. The food is poorly and often badly cooked.  

There were, however, several attractions: the money was good, as was the lifestyle, and, though the food was poor, the food was highly valued, and the chef was seen as being  in touch with the best and the most authentic that existed. One advantage of being a chef, in this country at least, was that you did not have to worry much about the domestic side of things. There were no children, so housekeeping was not an issue. It was easy to put together a life that involved little to no domestic or family responsibilities.  

After graduation it was a case of a few years of hard work followed by an investment of large sums of money to get to the level that would allow me to move into the higher paid specialist jobs. It took a while to work your way up the food chain to where you were making enough money to have a reasonable standard of living, but I had some very happy years cooking in some wonderful restaurants. It was there that I first tasted the wonders of the Lure of the Kitchen.  

I remember the first time I had duck. The first thing that struck me was how clean the kitchen was. There was nothing cluttery or smelly about it - everything was  tidy and ordered,"," However, despite my misgivings, I enrolled myself on a professional cookery course.
From the first lesson I was gripped by the romance of the kitchen. The smell of baking, the sight of a saucy roast chicken, the satisfaction that comes from the perfect crumbly bit on a piece of toast - I wanted to be a chef. The hours were long, the work hard, but when it was all said and done, I wanted to put on that apron and go to work in the kitchen. 

What is the lure of the kitchen for you?  

The words that came to my mind were: satisfying, interesting, creative, passionate, creative, challenge and hard work.

" There was a fire in the grate and it looked like a woman had recently vacated the room.

The young man stood with his back to the fire, one hand holding a whiskey and water, the other a cigarette. He leaned his arm along the mantel and lit up, cupping his hand over the flame so that it stayed alight. He turned to greet me and I was momentarily taken aback when I saw that the pupils of his eyes had swollen to the size of tennis balls. I tried to compose myself, but my brain was struggling to compute the extent of the horror unfolding before my eyes. My ears were still ringing from the gunshots and the drumming had just begun.

It would be an understatement to say I was unprepared for what happened next. The young man leaned forward and pulled a knife from his waistband. He pressed the cold blade against my side, just to the side of my shirt, and whispered into my ear. 

“It’s all right Tim. It’s going to be all right.”

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I looked at the young man’s hands. His fingers were long and manicured and wrapped around the knife. The blood was draining from my face. 

“Let’s call the police,” I said and stumbled out of the room. 

As I made my way out of the house and down the front steps, I heard m"," Everything was immaculate. I was introduced to Mr Farquhar, who was the butler at the house. “Mrs Farquhar, please. Mr Farquhar will find something for you to do,” the butler said. A well-tended garden stretched to the back of the house, the trees lined with hydrangea and lily of the valley. I was ushered to an armchair by the window and took out my notepad and pen. “Mr Rice, my name is Tim and Mrs Farquhar asked me to introduce myself. What can I do for you?” I was struck by the warmth in his eyes, which I realised were blue. “Tim, I wanted to know if you could recommend a good wine for dinner tonight?” “Absolutely, let me see if I can find something suitable.” After some Googling, I found an Australian Sauvignon Blanc for £8.99 on Amazon and placed the order. “Shall we say eight thirty?” I said. “Perfect timing. I’ll pick up the champagne as well.” We arranged to meet up and I arrived at the door of their home at eight thirty. I was led into the drawing room and saw Mr Farquhar by the fireplace. There he was in a long dark coat with a white shirt and waistcoat and trousers. He had slicked back grey hair and deep set eyes that sparkled with intelligence. I was relieved to see he was wearing"," The house was in a state of chaos, with clothing draped over chairs, toys strewn around the floor, and several unmade beds. However the atmosphere was one of quiet grace and an absence of fuss. I stood still for a moment, taking it in, and then gingerly opened the door to the master bedroom. It was a stark contrast to the rest of the house. The walls were dominated by an enormous flat-screen TV that dominated the room, while the other walls were lined with a collection of impressive oil paintings. I crept over to the closest painting and read the name: Picasso. As I took my seat the butler entered, his grey suit glistening under the hotel room’s lights and his demeanour calm and composed. I cleared my throat. “Good evening sir, it’s been too long.” He smiled. “Indeed. Do you have the guest list?”“Indeed, here it is. Will you have dinner with us?”“Thank you, that would be lovely,” I replied, as he disappeared into the kitchen. I settled down on the bed with a large whisky and began to sift through the paperwork. I was in the thick of divorce proceedings, and my job entailed liaising with various clients – not always the most popular experience. As I flipped through the pages, I spotted an interesting name – Tara. I’d never actually met the woman, but I’d certainly been in negotiations with her","

The parlour was spacious and airy, with a large table that could easily accommodate ten adults or more ten children at the same time. On the table was a beautifully ornate chess set and in a smaller table beside it were board games and a selection of dice.

The walls were full of sports memorabilia from the 1930’s and 40’s. There was a signed football from a World Cup victory, a photo album containing hundreds of photos of the family at that time, and an autographed photo of Jimmy Durante, a local celebrity.

Moving from the sports memorabilia to the fireplace was another upgrade. There was a beautiful wood burning fireplace filled with logs and a pile of old newspapers with photographs of local events from the late 1800’s on. 

It was in this setting that I was ushered into the young man’s drawing room.

The butler showed me to a plush, but sparsely furnished sitting room where tea had been placed and where I would be welcome to stay as long as I desired. “Please, have a seat”. I did as I was bid and took in the sights. 

A large oil painting of a man and a woman stood on the far wall, its colours vibrant and glowing. On the table sat a pile of books, a chess board and set of pieces. To my right, an elegant fireplace held a blazing fire, and a small, round table sat in front of it. 

I looked around the room, noticing that all of the furniture was upholstered and had soft padding on it. The walls were covered in art and there was even a built in piano in the corner of the room. I had never seen such a well equipped library in my life. 

There was a large portrait of a man sitting behind the table, looking me straight in the eyes. The man was younger than me, but his hair was styled in the latest fashions and he wore a suit of impeccable cut. 

“Mr Rice, I am Tim.” He stood up, and offered his hand. “Thank you for joining us. Please, make yourself at home”. 

He took a seat at the round table and we shook hands. He then leaned forward and said, “You must be very proud of your son.”. I"," To my amazement, I had just boarded a flight that had landed in a whole new country. The local dialect that the man spoke was similar to that of the BBC’s Top Gear presenter but with a heavy American accent. The rooms in the man’s home were in varying states of disarray, from the kitchen with the messiest floor and the least organised storage, to the parlour where an assortment of old board games were laying about randomly, to the third room where a large bed with a fancy canopy occupied the centre of the space, surrounded by a collection of stuffed animals. The final room I entered contained a large flat screen television with an assortment of DVDs sitting on top of it. I was surprised but also relieved to find that my rental car was still in the garage. The local currency appeared to be based on the US dollar. 

The man invited me to a seat on the edge of a cushiony couch that appeared to have been bought from a thrift store, and then proceeded to introduce himself. After a brief exchange of pleasantries he explained that he was a pilot for an airline that flew from Chicago to Seattle and that he travelled often to visit his family in the Seattle area. I also learned that his house was a reconstruction of the inside of a Boeing 747, the main living space being the middle section of the plane, which he occupied during his cross country flights. He said that the family had grown over the years and that he was now"," The air smelt deliciously of roasting coffee beans and bacon. In the doorway was a large oil painting of a ship under sail of the most glorious cobalt blue that I had ever laid eyes on, which had the fortunate side effect of drowning out all other conversation in the room. The room was divided up by a large stone built fireplace whose massive open hearth was the scene for much of the afternoon as a family of four sat around it enjoying a mid-afternoon cup of tea and a ploughman’s lunch while the kettle for their tea boiled and the log fire slowly burned. As the sun dropped behind the horizon and the twilight deepened I thought I had entered a scene from one of Robert Louis Stevenson’s tales of adventure, only instead of an uncharted island, I was on a sun dappled beach in Sussex in the summer of 1953. 
I soon found myself seated at the feet of a plump and elderly man whose appearance made me a bit wary. This seemed odd considering the fact I had just flown in from Dubai and my appearance was the result of two weeks of unrelenting heat and humidity and nothing short of a miracle had resulted in me emerging from that plane with any semblance of human features. The elderly man, however, didn’t seem quite so tense, in fact he appeared quite relaxed, and after I introduced myself, to my surprise he introduced himself as Tim Rice, the composer of “Jesus Christ Superstar"
" People had lost their jobs or were on short time and there was no certainty that they would be employed again in the medium to long term. For agencies business was very cautious and many agencies were cutting back their workforces dramatically.

However, the worst was yet to come for many in the advertising world. In the late 1990s, the internet really started to take off and the digital divide between those who had access to the internet and could find information and opinions on a variety of topics became much more acute. Faced with the prospect of the internet becoming an invaluable research tool for their marketing departments and, indeed, for internal communications, many agencies decided to take the plunge and invest in internet based advertising. Unfortunately the quality of advertising on the internet at that time was not good enough to attract sufficient commercial interest to make the investment worthwhile.

The advertising agencies response to this challenge was to create brand “Loyalty” programs. The core concept was to allow agencies to put a price on the brands consumers came to associate with the agency and a mechanism to incentivise consumption of that brand. The endgame of the program was for the agencies to sell advertising on behalf of the brand on sites such as google adwords. The hope was that the investment in the advertising would pay for itself through higher sales of product and services created through advertising spending.

The program proved successful beyond their wildest dreams and, in order to sustain it and ensure future success, the agencies created new business"," In 1990 you were working on a large pitch for a client called 'Domecq'. The client was a small international cosmetics company that made skin products for the face and body. This was to be your first big pitch of the day. You'd spent months preparing for this task. 

Domecq was a small company - even for the 1990s and the face and body products were niche. The client was well known in their industry, however this was the early 1990s - a time where you really couldn't afford to be a niche player. The pitch was to a group of middle market account executives of a European cosmetics company and a smaller, but growing, market for Domecq's products. 

The client described Domecq's products as 'the ultimate in women's beauty'. The pitch was to persuade the account executives to increase their annual spend by 400,000 pounds over the following 3 years. 

You spent months preparing this pitch and it felt like the entire campaign would hinge on the right answer from this one meeting. As the meeting approached you were sure you'd get a thumbs down and you'd have to spend the afternoon coming up with an alternative plan. But then you got to that meeting and your heart sank - you'd done some quick research on the account executives and realised they were young and very fashionable and the products really was the ultimate in women's beauty. This was the trigger you needed to hit the magic note."," With recession after recession, companies cutting back and staff made redundant this was a dark period indeed for everyone concerned. So it was for your agency as you faced years of decline and likely closure. Your board was not particularly sympathetic, no wonder as it seemed you had been unable to find a single client for over two years. And this was despite setting up an entire unit for new business and a pool of talented staff capable of taking it to the next level. There were few and far between and they were always of the least commercial and strategic interest to your company. So you looked on dejectedly as the board discussed their options and it was only with a sudden thump of relief that you realised that a contact at a major publisher, had just signed a 4 year agreement for a new brand to be launched during the year. This was the start of a new era for your agency with an influx of new business, media coverage of the launch and the establishment of an entire team of experienced creative specialists to take it to the next level. 

Thankfully for you, your contact at the publisher had a soft spot for advertising. It transpired that they were very excited by the brief and the creativity you had demonstrated in working with the design team to produce a truly innovative brand identity. They were eager to spend time with you to help you fine tune your creative brief and then set about raising the profile of your brand with a carefully crafted media launch.

What happened next is something of a blur"," The economic slowdown was so pronounced that the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE) gave the year 1992 the nickname of ‘Black Monday’.

ASNE, which publishes the world’s largest newspaper, The Los Angeles Times, gave the following definition of advertising: “Advertising is the communication of a product or service to the public to encourage sales of the product or service or to announce the existence of a service and the benefits of it to a potential customer. Advertising is usually paid for by charging a fee or by the sale of goods and services to the advertiser.” 

The toughest of the advertising agency’s life during the early 1990s was a direct consequence of the US recession of the time. The recession had a direct impact on the advertising budget of all companies. Ad agencies faced major cuts in their ad budgets and consequently had to significantly reduce the adverts they produced for their clients.

During the 1980s, the most innovative and effective advertising campaigns were executed. The biggest brands of the times invested heavily in advertising, as they aimed to increase brand awareness and increase their bottom line. In particular, television advertising became extremely expensive: the 1980s saw the launch of HDTV (High Definition Television) by means of which audiences could view HDTV advertisements and programmes at relatively low cost. 

But, after two decades of HDTV and another one of recession, by 1993 the advertising market started to experience a major crisis. This caused the"," 

There was no avoiding it: the advertising recession was upon us. The bad times had already started in the second half of 1989: the first fall-out of the so-called “property crash” was being felt in the advertising agencies as the budgets were cut on projects that hadn’t been implemented yet, and already looked unlikely to be. 

And then on 23rd September of that year came the crash, and it didn’t stop till the end of the year. The bad feelings were intensified by the reactionary nature of the new Conservative government, and by its general aversion to anything it perceived as “Big Government”. 

Amid the gloom the agency’s account manager for account services, Sally-Anne, was trying to reassure her staff that things would improve; she tried explaining that they’d just gone to extra effort to ensure there wouldn’t be a budget cut in the forthcoming quarter, and they’d be back to normal, with no need for special considerations, in four weeks. 

But Sally-Anne wasn’t the only one feeling gloomy. In the office, and in the canteen, the atmosphere was one of subdued gloom. But then came the crash in the stock market. The pound, which had been steady all year, suddenly fell dramatically against the euro, making British goods even more expensive in the rest of Europe. 

And then the cuts came. And even before they were announced, Sally"," The recession was global, there wasn’t an advertising department in the entire word that wasn’t hit. You, as an agency employee, you’d had the misfortune of working on some of the most costly, most ambitious and arguably most interesting creative of your era and suddenly your first year in the late 1990s would be remembered as a time to be ashamed of your job.

So you were at a loose end when a friend suggested you should apply for a job at Chubb (let’s call them ‘Chubb’ for short), an insurance company that had just placed some of the most critically acclaimed and award winning advertising campaigns of the time on their portfolio. You were initially sceptical but after a round of beers and a chat with him your friend mentioned that he had been offered a job to run the new division and might be willing to put in a word with you to get you the call. So you went and interviewed and the experience of that day was one you’ll never forget. 

Your first encounter was with the Head of Marketing, Chris ‘Slasher’ Slasher (‘Chris’ for short) who introduced himself and gave you an overview of the division and its plans. He was personable, engaging and you were soon convinced he was the man to drive Chubb’s ‘agency go go go’ culture forward. After all he was ‘the man’ himself, he had started the division and had the mandate"," This was before the advent of internet and social media the 1990s was a challenging time for those in advertising, even more so if you were lucky to be in the creative department. This was also before the advent of direct to television. This meant for those in creative advertising the advertising hoardings in the street had to be re-created, there were no pre-loaded images or footage to use in-house. Many creative directors resorted to drawing inspiration from their travels or their own experiences or even worse, from other creative departments of their employer or even the work of rivals. 
I worked for a major advertising agency. In the 90s the ad industry was going through a difficult time and so were we as a creative department. However, we did not resort to drawing inspiration from other creative departments or even from work of rivals. We used our own experiences, our travels and the advertising hoardings on the street. We had to re-create these and we used very basic sentence patterns that we had memorised during the training, using phrases like ""the early years"", ""toughest"" or ""recession"".

" So, here is a (somewhat) safe, though not entirely risk-free, guide to getting your poetry done. 

Preparation
Before you begin writing, it is critical that you set aside a time to do so.  Time management is critical to the art of poetry writing, so make a conscious effort to carve out time to write.  It doesn’t need to be a long walk; any spare moment where you can clear your mind and let the words flow is ideal.  To help you make time for writing, consider creating an outline of where you want to take your poem.  This will give you focus, but also a clear sense of where to start, where to slow down, and what to leave for later.

Now that you have a time and a place to write, it’s time to think about the words you want to use to best express yourself.  In order to use the best and most powerful words, it’s crucial you read widely in poetry.  Beyond that, consider making a collage of words you find meaningful, and look for ways to incorporate those words into your poem.  Pay particular attention to the poetic elements listed here, and when you find a suitable combination, make an effort to employ that sequence in your poem.

Structure
Poetry is structured around four major elements:
- rhyme
- alliteration
- assonance, or ""twining words"" together
-"," Start off by writing down any memorable quotes or sayings that come to mind. Then write down the sentiment of the statement (i.e. the emotions it evokes in you). Finally, build a poem by linking your statement of sentiment to the quotes you have chosen. 

I am a bit of a minefield for my children these days.   I can hear my daughter, who is 7, asking me ""What is a minefield anyway?"".   This week, I received a package of poetry books from Australia that included ""Poems Out Loud"" by Carol Ann Duffy.   She asked me, not very coaxingly if I would like to read some of the poems out loud to her, and I said ""yes, but make sure you put the book down because you will probably trip over some of the words"".  And so, over the next few days, I read the following poems out loud to my daughter:

My Man's A Minefield (the quotes included were from a radio interview I heard and read in my car on the way to work yesterday):

My man's a minefield, if he says yes, don't go near him
My man's a minefield, don't go near him
Because when you talk to him, you're never quite sure what's going to come out of your mouth next,
Because everything he says just might turn out to be wrong,
And you'll feel so sad when","  

Start by finding a poem that inspires you and write a summary of what happens in the poem.  Give the summary the same amount of space to fit in as there is in the poem.  

For example, “the poem begins in a rainy night when a little child wakes up and looks out the window to see a butterfly.  She tells her dad what she’s seen, and her dad says ‘It must have rained just right for that to happen’.  Mom reminds the child it’s time for her nap, so the child says she’ll read her poem to us in the morning.’ 

The poem begins:
In the rain, on a winter’s night
when the little child came to wake,
her dad said, as he held her close:
“It must have rained just right for that...”

The line breaks in the poem are to make the poem easier to read.  Read the poem aloud.  Now read the first and last sentences again, and then the second to last and then the second to second to last.  When you read the poem try to catch each line when it’s spoken and then say it out loud.  

Finally, rewrite the poem using the same technique used to write it down.  When you’re writing the poem down, make each line a sentence.

Don’t worry if it takes some trial and error to write"," So write your poetry with care and precision, but do get around the mines in any way you like. 

Here is one example of a poem titled “The Art of Being Boring” written by American poet Steve Wasserman.   

The Art of Being Boring
The art of being boring is to admit 
that there is nothing unique about your experience;
that the same stories are told by every person;
that each of us is simply bored,
like everyone else. 

This requires a certain level of self-awareness,
and a keen sense of humor.

If you’ve never been bored, 
you’ve never tried very hard.

Boredom is not to be feared, 
it’s a natural by-product of even the hardest endeavors;
it’s just a part of the human condition, 
and the only way to survive it is to remember you’re not special.

There’s nothing special about the path we chose, 
there’s nothing special about the company we keep,
there’s nothing special about the jobs we hold, 
there’s nothing special about the houses we buy, 
there’s nothing special about the cars we drive.

"," So instead, I’ll give you a few pointers, starting with the basics. First of all, if you want to write poetry you need to be able to compose in couplets. And you need to write in the couplet form, using the caesura (a.k.a. colon) as the key break. That is to say that the final couplet must be terminated in iambic rhymes with a feminine ending and an anapest followed by a feminine ending. The other form of couplet (and, indeed, the only other form of couplet allowed in poetry) is the heroic couplet, which is terminated in iambic rhymes with a masculine ending. Finally, the three lines of an iambic pentameter are used as a stanza in which to write a long poem.

With all this in mind you should be off and running. The first couplet will be easy enough:

“The first day of Spring brings little joy

The second brings more joy than you might think

The third brings still more and then the fourth

The fifth brings not the end but more to rejoice”

From there, you can improvise a little. Just don’t get carried away! Remember that poetry is supposed to be fun – if it’s too hard it will lose its impact and if it’s too easy it’ll be dull. I’d suggest you write"
" And that’s where the DIY community stepped in and developed the so-called “content farms” and the software that runs them. The so-called “bloggers” were the first to exploit these technical possibilities and started to publish literary criticism and reviews on the Internet. This had the effect of establishing an international forum for literary criticism and reviews. Today however the number of critics has become somewhat self-sustainable. Critics from all over the world have established “content farms” and have published literary criticism and reviews online. While this doesn’t necessarily make DIY literary criticism more than just harmless fun, it does allow for a diversity of opinions. It also increases the level of critical thinking required to make up one’s mind. And that, of course, is always more than just harmless fun.


Open Source Criticism: the Diversity of Opinions in Do-it-Yourself Literary Criticism, by Annette Weber.


This is a very interesting overview of the development of DIY literary criticism, which was sparked by Blogging: A Patronizing History of Tongue, by John Markoff. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Cheers!


This is actually very interesting and interesting reading. I don't really understand why it is called ""do-it-yourself"" criticism, because it is more of a public art than something you have to do by yourself. Do-it-your"," For example it required a minimum of two people: one to write the manifesto or music channel and the other to program the website. The latter was not easy because programming in HTML was not exactly the same as programming in musical notation. Furthermore, all Internet traffic had to be routed through the country of the website's operator. This brought Internet access in many countries to a halt, causing the manifesto to be viewed by only a handful of people at most. The manifesto had to be posted in prominent libraries and bookshops in order to be viewed by as many people as possible, which of course meant that they had to be physically near the Internet or connected to it via broadband. It turned out that there was a price to be paid for putting the manifesto on the Internet. The manifesto's authors received little or no compensation for their work and this was a source of resentment among many of the manifesto's readers. The manifesto's authors thus decided to organize an Internet radio channel of their own. This was a more or less spontaneous decision. Their idea was to create a radio channel on the Internet from the broadcasters' lounge of a university. The radio channel would be broadcast 24 hours a day for seven days and would consist of recorded copies of concerts. In this way the channel would provide a comprehensive coverage of the world of classical music. A few days later they created the website of the radio channel. In theory they had the know-how to handle everything: from establishing"," This led to the rise of so-called ""cybercriticism"" in the first half of the century. An article in The New York Times from 1998 is an example of early online literary criticism: ""Cybercriticism at its finest: An interview with George Tzvetanov"". He describes himself as a cybercritic, ""writer, editor, publisher"" and a ""digital humanist"". A ""digital humanist"" is someone who embraces the humanities (here: literature, history, philosophy) because knowledge is ""a gift from the gods, created to help us understand our place in the universe and our place in the universe of things"". Tzvetanov is proud of his work as a cybercritic and in particular of his project that has allowed thousands of users to write their own literary critiques of classical music and theater scores on the Internet: ""I started an initiative called the Digital Humanities Office of the University of Pennsylvania in 2000. It allowed users to post reviews of scores from classical music and theater performances. Thousands of users contributed hundreds of thousands of reviews. I then took the data that was being collected and organized it into a search engine that provided users with critical commentary about the scores and composers they were hearing."" In the same article Tzvetanov says that, with the rise of the World Wide Web, ""technology was supposed to change the very nature of the humanities"". He thinks otherwise: ""It's actually helped us return"," 

One of the major problems at the dawn of the Internet, when information was disseminated mainly via telephonic and print media, was the transmission of documents of any length. With the advent of the World Wide Web however, document publishing could finally be facilitated on a mass scale. 

Online publishing and distribution of texts has completely changed the literary landscape. As a result of this digital revolution the number of academic studies and manifestos, in contrast to music and film channels, has risen steeply. Yet the question remains whether online publication of literary texts is merely a harmless form of self-expression with no educational value or whether this could prove to be more than just harmless fun.


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale measures how easy it is to read and understand words, phrases and sentences. A grade level corresponds to a specific level of education - the number of years of education that is needed to successfully graduate from school.


Online literary criticism is certainly more than just harmless fun. In fact, online publishing of texts and the proliferation of academic manifestos and studies has been a decisive factor in the rapid growth of the literary scene over the last decade. It is therefore reasonable to assume that this form of publishing and distribution will continue to gain popularity in the years to come.


In summary, the idea of open access to the Internet was more than just harmless fun. It has, in fact, had a considerable influence on the literary scene.


The"," It took a great deal of time and technical expertise to develop high-tech tools that allowed for the publication of written texts online. In short, it required do-it-yourself literary criticism. The first websites devoted exclusively to literary criticism date back to the late 1990s and early 2000. Among these one has to mention the Berlin based website LiteratureOnLine. The American version Literature Online (LO) was established in the early 2000s as a project of the University of Illinois. Both are still operating and continue to add new literary texts, films, music videos and other media content. LiteratureOnline.com, however, is no longer in operation. LiteratureOnLine.de became insolvent in 2009, and the site's domain www.literatureonline.de was transferred to the public register in 2011. The European Literary Archive at the University of Udine also offers an online platform for the evaluation of literary texts.

Open access, or do-it-yourself literary criticism, has been the rule from the outset of the Internet. But is this really a good idea? For the critics themselves, of course, this meant a certain amount of hardship. They had to invest a certain amount of time and technical expertise in order to develop high-tech tools that would allow for the publication of written texts online. The sites devoted exclusively to literary criticism did not exist at that time. First of all, it required know-how, not just technological know-how but also"," The manifestos themselves were generally limited in length. Also, it was necessary for the speakers to find a comfortable online audience, and thus attract visitors to their sites. At the same time it was desirable to keep the number of hits for each individual site at an acceptable level. Therefore, for the first several years, the attractiveness of a site was estimated using its Flesch score, which is calculated automatically by the web browser with the help of statistical algorithms. The goal was to provide a rough idea of the reader's ability to understand the text. As technology continued to develop, the attractiveness of a site also tended to be determined by the number of links that the site contained to other web pages. By 2013 the concept of open access to the Internet was further refined in light of the results of further research by scholars. It was decided that the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale could provide a better indicator of how easy it is to understand a written text. This scale is based on the text itself, and takes into account the total number of words, sentences, and syllables. The more words, sentences, and syllables there are in a text, the higher the grade level of the reader is assumed to be. As a first approximation, the grade level of a text can be expressed as a number between 20 and 100. The closer the number is to 80, the harder it is to understand a text. On the other hand, texts written in Chinese, Malay"," Anyone who could download a word processor, a page layout program and a graphics program would have been able to make a site. In those days even an average computer was considered extremely expensive. Since the late 1990s, with the increasing affordability of personal computers, online publishing, even in its primitive form, has been widespread. In other words, the technical know-how to create a website was within the reach of anyone who had access to a computer and an Internet connection. However, it was only in recent years that the Internet became increasingly popular and a general interest in the arts emerged. With such a rapid rise in use of the Internet, it would therefore have been considered a waste if artists and musicians had to hire professional Internet marketers and web developers in order to publish their manifestos. In other words, online publishing has proved to be a more than just harmless fun. The advantages of online publishing could however hardly have been perceived at the beginning of the new millennium. On one hand, it allowed the work to be disseminated more quickly than if it were published in book form, a medium which still remained inexpensively available. On the other hand, it gave access to a far larger audience, something that in the past would have been difficult to realize. At first sight, all of this seems like a huge advantage for anyone who would like to publish a manifesto or even a music channel. For an audience which is increasingly interested in the arts, this can also be seen as a potential"
" Chen was beginning to think his faith in the sisters had not been misplaced and one morning he arrived to find all three of them standing outside the gasworks with the car.
“So you want to drive a car now?” he asked.
“Yes, why not?” said one of the sisters.
“You must be mad!”, he said. “The sisters would never agree to such a thing. Besides, I am not going to let you drive that dangerous car. I will drive you home.”
“No you won’t,” said the other sister. “He is my brother, after all. I want him to drive us home.”
So Chen helped the two sisters into the car and took his place at the wheel. It was a hot morning and they had only driven a short distance when the engine failed. After a few minutes, Lily, who was driving, heard the sound of a car coming towards her. She stopped the car and jumped out. She saw the two sisters struggling in the arms of a man with a long white beard, and when she shouted “stop thief!”, the man was suddenly grabbed by the two sisters and beaten to the ground with canes and rods. “Oh, you are going to die”, the sisters said as they took his keys from his fingers.
When the man got up from the ground he was completely disoriented, and after wandering around for a few minutes he saw a police car coming and took off running."," One day, they were out there when the old man who looked after the allotments saw their car and wondered what they were doing out there at that hour of the morning. He went to see what they were up to. The elder sister immediately climbed out of the car and apologized profusely for disturbing him and his family so late at night, but told the old man that the car had broken down and that they would be glad to get his help with it. The old man offered to take them to their destination, which was about a mile or so down the railway line.

The old man took them to a spot by the railway line. ‘I built this bridge a few years ago as a bit of fun, when we had a bit of spare time,’ the old man said. ‘We named it the Hump-Backed Bridge because it looks like that when all four wheels go up in the air.’

The sisters were amazed to see that the old man was telling the truth. They thanked him profusely, and he went off to his cottage to get some tools. The sisters then got in the car and drove home. The sisters told Lily to keep quiet about what she had discovered. They knew the old man was going to be furious when he returned to discover that his allotment had been vandalized. Lily decided to go to sleep in the hope that the old man would go to bed early and they would be able to carry out"," 

She kept this a secret from Chen because she believed that Lily would get into even more trouble if she knew the truth. However, she herself is secretly very keen to drive her sister’s car.


Chen thought that the secret would be safe with Lily forever. However, one day Lily announced that she was going to the store to buy food. 

Chen was furious. ""Food? Food for a baby goat and you're going to the store? That's a serious breach of trust!"" 

But Lily was already out the door, the little Hummingbird in her left hand, a bundle of groceries in her right. 

Chen could see that the sisters had split the difference between them and that Lily had taken the more direct route. This made her suspicious. 
It didn’t take long for Chen to find her sister driving through the allotments and across the little hump-backed bridge.


Chen was horrified. She called Lily back, who she was chatting to on her cellphone. 

Lily ignored her sister. She stepped on the gas and headed out into the country lanes, humming a little song under her breath. 

Chen had to drive as fast as she could to catch up to her sister. When she did, she saw that there was no car—only a goat, the Hummingbird and the rest of Lily's groceries, minus a bottle of milk.


Chen jumped"," 
  
When their father found out about Lily’s driving he took a can of black paint and covered the gas tank, the manifold and the brake cable. He then parked the car in the garage and told Lily to wait for ten years before trying to drive again. When their father found Lily had disobeyed him he told them Lily’s driving was “not safe to know anything about” and ordered her never to speak of it to anyone again. 
  
After a few weeks the three sisters were confident that they could drive the car around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks again and they decided to try it. 
  
When their father found out Lily had driven again he was furious and took a can of black paint and splashed it all over the car. Then he smashed it with a hammer. When the sisters tried to tell their parents about Lily’s driving their father said that it was “not safe to know anything about” and made them promise never to speak of it to anyone again. 
  
The sisters’ father then drove them to the garage to get a used car. When the car arrived the sisters realised it had been driven by a stranger, so they contacted the police and reported their father for the car’s theft and vandalism. 
  
Their father was arrested and spent eight months in prison. His punishment included wearing a special leg iron, taking a hard slap on the hand every morning at six o’clock"," 

Chen noticed some irregularities in the sisters’ behaviour, such as their driving without the car on, but she was uncertain whether they were simply being rash in their enthusiasm to see if the car could drive itself, or whether they had lost control of the vehicle and were attempting to flee the allotments. 

One day, however, the sisters returned the car to Lily with the engine still running. Chen realised the truth: the sisters had taken over the car and had driven it to a remote location, where they had broken it down and left the pieces for the birds. 

Chen was extremely angry. She could have taken action against the two sisters for attempting to harm Lily and contravening the rules of the allotments, but she was worried about the impact on their relationship, so she allowed the sisters to return the car, but made Lily spend the weekend in the allotments as punishment. 

When they returned, Lily was distraught, and confessed that she too had driven the car to a remote location. 

Chen, on the other hand, looked completely calm. She pointed out that they had both driven the car to a remote location and that the sisters, having failed to crash and burn the vehicle, had instead broken it down, so the two had driven the broken down vehicle to a remote location and then rebuilt it. 

Chen treated the two sisters to a picnic lunch at which the sisters were able to tell their side of the"," 

Chen eventually realised Lily was no longer hiding the truth from her and was driving her around, often to the dismay of her parents. The sisters were summoned to their parents' house and the family was horrified to hear the truth. The sisters were grounded and the bridge was replaced with the hump-backed version.

The sisters' knew Lily would go to such lengths to impress her sister, and they enjoyed seeing her anxiety. They agreed that Lily had to make an excellent driver so that she could drive her parents' car and they would arrange for her to go to the same college as Chen so that they could take up leadership of the Red Dragons.  When the sisters heard that Lily had passed her driving test and was ready to drive themselves when the time was right, they could not resist showing off. 

A2 can also be described as ""A1 +"".

  

In the spring Lily was offered an A level in history after performing very well during her A levels.  She was now able to drive her parents' car as they would be getting a new one.

The sisters were beside themselves with excitement. When Lily told them that she needed about a month to prepare for the history exam, they knew that it would be perfect:  they had been working for some time on a plan for when Lily got her driving licence.  On the appointed day, they waited at the college. 

Lily arrived, and was very nervous.  The sisters took her to the test centre.  Lily practised the route, and the sisters timed her braking and acceleration.  Lily had to do many things wrong, but she got it right.  Then they told her"

1. Why are cowboy boots expensive? 
Cowboy boots were originally intended to protect the legs of the wearers, but the large size of the soles and the extra layers of materials that had to be worn underneath have made them rather impractical for modern day use. The extreme weight and durability required also meant that the wearers often developed tendonitis (inflammation of the tendons in the feet) and other foot issues from the constant wearing of the boots. These issues were compounded by the fact that boots were often not cleaned properly, meaning that bacteria built up under the sole which was then transmitted to the wearer's feet. 

2. Why do cowboy boots have to be new? 
This is a common misconception. New boots will not necessarily be more practical or durable than used boots, but will be much"," It was very hot that day and I didn't want to take my boots off. I'm in my favorite pair, after all! So I just kept walking around the rocks and did a few of my favorite things. Rode my bike. Tied my lasso. Did a couple of front flips. Wore my hat, that I proudly carried in my left hand, to keep my left hand free to operate my helmet with. As the day wore on and my girlfriend and I started to get cold from hiking and riding our bikes around without our boots, I realized I needed to put my boots back on. The decision to remove them was hard, though, because there I was, out in the middle of nowhere with the most beautiful woman in the world, doing all sorts of things I had done a million times before while wearing my very expensive boots. But I just couldn't bring myself to put them back on. So I put on my other pair, which were much cheaper and less intimidating and walked back to our car in them because they were too darn hot out there to keep wearing. I've never been so happy to put them in the box.

Paul Evans is a freelance science writer in Oxford.


This is a great example of using story telling to explore complex topics in an engaging way. The prompt and story provide the framework for the essay. The essay then uses the provided information to explore a broader set of questions. The essay also provides a useful set of prompts to the reader for further exploration.

Paul Evans begins the essay by briefly outlining the complex relationship between humans and birds. He also provides a brief history of bird worship. He then provides an example of a bird ""bump bump bump"" as it approaches the window of a greenhouse. The essay ends with a summary and the author's recommendation for further reading.


While the author makes clear at the outset of the essay that he is not an expert on birds or their worship, he uses his knowledge of the topic to inform a story that raises interesting and provocative questions about the complexity of this relationship. This essay is well worth reading.


I think the most interesting part of the essay is this suggestion for further reading. Paul Evans suggests reading ""the Bible as a bird"":

The author concludes his essay by suggesting that a ""bump bump bump"" may be a harbinger of great changes to come. I personally find this intriguing. I would love to read more about the author's view on the subject."," And this is no ordinary wren. It's a wren of the spring: a harbinger of renewal and rebirth.

Love them fear them worship them human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Love them fear them worship them is a very human mantra. Love them fear them worship them is a popular sentiment, but is it really the best way forward. If we take the wren's advice we will no longer see wrens as creatures of the wolds we will no longer see them as birds of omen and portent or as the harbinger of renewal and rebirth. We will see them as a pest. We will see them as pests who eat our worms and our seed and our fruit. We will see the wren not as a harbinger of renewal but as a harbinger of our own downfall.

I feel like it's watching me, perhaps assessing me: here, now, fearing me. It must be hungry; it's been asking for scraps from the kitchen. I return to the kitchen, where my wife, children, and many pets feast. Birds have a long history as symbols of divination, portent, and fear. The ancient Greeks linked the birds of summer with prophecy, winter with famine, and the caged birds with slaves. The Romans adopted these ideas and the image of the wild goose as a substitute for the free bird. Birds of prey became symbols of warfare and death. The early Christian Church began to embrace the world of birds as symbolic of the natural environment and its inhabitants. And today, in modern western culture"," A wren in a church is a sign of death; a wren in a greenhouse is a sign of winter. It's also a bird associated with springtime rebirth, which makes it even more ominous. It's been happening more and more in the UK of late, where the wren has been joined by the Eurasian sparrowhawk. These birds are after pigeon eggs. They lay their eggs in them. They then hunt them in groups and kill them with crossbow-like talons. The sparrowhawk is a sign of change and rebirth, and now our gardens are filled with chicks. So our warning from the wren is: beware of change. And it's a warning that applies to many aspects of our lives, from the way we vote to the food we eat. And it's an ancient warning we can't afford to ignore.

The story should follow a love, fear, worship pattern: love - fear - worship - love - fear - worship - love - fear - worship - love. The story could also mention birds as symbols of renewal.


Birds are very interesting animal. They have evolved over millions of years to be very successful at what they do. The reason that they have evolved the way they have is because of the threats that birds face.  Birds are the only group of mammals that fly. When we view birds from the air, one of the most prevalent things we see is flocking"," They say a true Briton is a wren to his toes. But why the fear? For a start, they're a family of birds known to be highly intelligent not prone to hysterics the male has long orange beards that have the power of persuasion. They are social animals meaning that birds of a feather flock together. Wrens live in the cracks of society, laying their own unique eggs in the crevices of buildings and hedgerows. They have a song which has been described as ""the purest music"" and one of the best lullabies in the bird world. They have been said to be the closest we humans can get to a God species. But perhaps the greatest threat to our relationship with birds comes not from their intelligence or singing, but from the way we treat them. There is a growing body of evidence, from the birds themselves, from our own personal experience of wildlife crime, and from scientific studies, that shows birds are being hunted for their skins their feathers their plumage to be used in Asian medicine and as a sign of prestige. What does this say about us? The relationship between humans and animals is one of our oldest and most basic one's we may not be aware of the violence animals go through just to survive. The cruelty to animals displayed in the news or at the movies is often disturbing. From battery farms to circuses to zoos, the abuse of animals has existed for a long time and unfortunately is likely to continue."," And this isn't the first time. The school has a history of losing wrens. These days wrens are just another species of bird that is disappearing. 

Paul Evans presents a compelling argument that we are treating the world and its inhabitants unfairly towards birds because they are smaller than humans.

" Joanna knows that all children learn best through hands on experience. So she goes beyond the usual pedagogy of sight reading and encourages the pianist to use their hands. By playing pieces that feature her own hand motions (like this) she is effectively teaching her own students to play! This philosophy seems to have spread far beyond the confines of the concert piano world. The idea that the arts must engage with life in order to be truly worthwhile seems to be beginning to sink in. You can see evidence of this in Joanna’s approach to teaching children to play the piano and to write books that actually appeal to the widest possible audience. In both her piano lessons and her book “First Steps on the Piano” Joanna uses finger-style playing (although not in the modern “transcribed” style) and encourages her students to use their own hand motions. In the “First Steps on the Piano” book she has illustrated a variety of positions for the hands and fingers and invites the reader to try them out themselves. The result is the most charming children’s books you will ever see. I’ve read them to my daughter and my son and they are now permanently on their book shelves!

The two hands are playing Chopsticks while the fingers of both hands go in different directions!

What does the human hand look like? If you look on the internet you will find diagrams of hands, but none that look like this.

","  “… and then the angels came down and said to the shepherds, ‘Go to where Joanna is, and when you see her, ask her to join us. ‘So the shepherds went and found Joanna, and when they told her the angels’ words, she was very happy. ‘Go back to the angels, and tell them that I will never learn the piano—I have enough for my family and I don’t need anyone else’s money!’” 

Joanna is writing books to help encourage young children to learn the piano and the message is simple: “Joanna doesn’t need the piano to make a living. Joanna has enough money for her family.” 

Joanna does, however, have one request for any publishers who might consider publishing her books. She writes that the publishers: “Please put the books back in the piano at the end of the performance! You see, Joanna doesn’t want to keep the piano company after the concert is over.” 

Joanna’s Books  Joanna has been inspired to write children’s books after reading E.B. White’s The White House Christmas. In that book, White used the piano as a backdrop and her illustrations were based on her daughter’s description of a piano-pounding Joanna. Joanna is an experienced concert pianist and has performed all over the world. She has found that her passion is often the only path"," Joanna knows that teaching young children the piano can be an enriching experience. “The ability to read music and perform scales and arpeggios is the foundation of literacy. The joy of playing music can have positive effects on mental health. Learning a musical instrument can help a child relax and improve focus. Joanna has created books to help young children learn the piano and she invites young children to attend her concerts to witness the magic first hand. 

In her debut book “The Joy of Piano,” Joanna discusses the reasons for learning the piano and discusses her own learning experiences. Joanna dedicates a section of the book to explaining notation, scales and arpeggios.


In her debut book, “The Joy of Piano,” Joanna dedicates a section to explaining notation, scales and arpeggios. This section is engaging and helpful for young children to be able to read music and perform basic scales and arpeggios. It is also engaging for adults to be able to help young children with reading music so they can have the ability to perform at a higher level. The section also provides guidance for developing a musical foundation which is an important aspect of fostering a lifelong passion for music.


Joanna has designed her books to be written at a grade 3 level and she dedicates her book “The Joy of Piano” to the young child learning to read music. She invites young children to attend her concerts to witness the magic first hand"," 

Joanna attributes her success to building a nurturing environment for young children to grow and develop skills that will serve them long into adulthood. Through her teaching and coaching, Joanna hopes to inspire the next generation of child prodigies, many of whom are now professional musicians themselves. 

Joanna’s first book, Piano for Dummies, is written in a friendly, easy-to-follow manner for complete beginners. Joanna has also written a series of books for professional musicians on topics such as practice, technique, and repertoire. 

Joanna is currently touring the United States and appears at your favorite local concerts and music events. She loves meeting new fans and hearing their stories about how the piano has impacted their lives.

Here is a passage from Joanna’s website. Please note that this passage is written at a reading grade level of 7th grade (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level = 7).

Piano for Dummies

Everyone needs to learn to play the piano. It doesn't matter if you've been playing for years or you're just starting out. Learning to play the piano takes some discipline, lots of practice, and a clear understanding of how to play the basic notes and chords of the piano keyboard.

This book is for those who are new to the piano and needs a crash course"," With Joanna’s help, we will all learn to play and improve as pianists ourselves. Joanna has shared her extensive experience of what worked in the learning process and what did not. This book is a treasure trove of ideas and approaches which Joanna herself has employed and recommends for its relevance and usefulness to both beginning and experienced pianists. 

A2 learners should be able to read this text without difficulty but they should also be able to understand the core ideas of the text. 

Joanna's experiences and insights about how to teach the piano to children are presented in an interesting and entertaining style that appeals to the layman reader. There is an excellent mix of examples, anecdotes, and insights gathered from Joanna's own experiences both in training new pianists and working with children who have had less then optimal piano start. A number of the ideas are simple variations on standard approaches but the approach is unique and interesting. 

Joanna MacGregor certainly has a unique insight into how to best approach learning the piano with children. She uses many examples and anecdotes from her personal experiences to illustrate the core ideas which give the book credibility. The book also includes examples of Joanna’s own ideas and suggestions which help to substantiate many of the ideas. 

Overall this is a very useful book which is clearly written and illustrates a number of ideas which can be used in the teaching of the piano.

This book has a lot of potential to help"," 

Writing children’s books can be a fulfilling experience. Joanna is able to convey a sense of wonder to her audience and leave them humming the tune or tune of the end. While her books may be aimed at children, they are not simplistic in approach, and Joanna demonstrates an understanding of the complexities of the piano and its many facets. In the end, all children are children of the piano, and Joanna MacGregor helps to keep that legacy vibrant by continuing to share her love of it with the generations who come after her.


Joanna’s Lessons are written in first person. They begin: Joanna is playing a gig. Concerts are her full-time occupation; she also teaches piano to children at the local school. 

Joanna’s children’s piano books are divided into four categories. The first is about the piano itself. The second covers Joanna’s own childhood. In the third section Joanna shares stories of her students’ piano journeys. The final section, “Credits”, lists Joanna’s musician friends and family, and describes how they are associated with the piano.


Joanna starts each book by outlining the context of the story: she is performing a piece by Beethoven at an international piano competition, in Berlin, Germany. She goes on to describe the mood and excitement of the audience as they listen to the performance. She follows this with a description of the instrument and"," Joanna herself was a child and still remembers the pride she felt when she won a competition for the youngest pupils of her school. It is no wonder, then, that she has now written three books for children aged three to seven on the piano. 
  
The first book “What’s the big deal about chords?“, is an introduction to piano through familiarization with basic chords. It clearly explains the rules of chords, explains why chords are important for a pianist and introduces basic techniques like alternate playing of the chords. The book is not only easy to read for a three year old, it also offers a good overview of the whole piano repertoire. 
  
The second book “Let’s get together!” starts with the same chords, but Joanna also shows different approaches to playing them, from hammering away in the fast chords to playing legato and glissandi. It also teaches the listener scales, a feature which is rarely mentioned in classical piano lessons. Again the book is not only easy to read, it shows the reader how to use different techniques. In addition, Joanna even includes a small mini-music-box in the book which comes to life during the performance to accompany the reading. 
  
The third and final book “Piano Puzzle”. is yet another introduction to the piano repertoire. The author shows the reader examples from the classical repertoire and asks the reader to match the fingerings with the notes"

The first step in adapting a novel for film is usually to find a screenwriter, sometimes called a “screenwriter’s window.” It sounds cool but if you Google “screenwriter’s window” you may be disappointed to learn it does not exist.

Screenwriters who are open to adaptations often search within their personal library for material with characters they relate to, and a similar setting to theirs. If you are not a fan of the book you may have discovered this when your book club voted it “boring” or when the movie release date came and went without a sequel.

When I began writing this screenplay, the only person who had read the book was my wife and she didn’t think it was a good idea. So I wrote a blank screenplay and found it surprisingly easy to fill in.

Every Picture Tells a Story

Daisy Westfall (aka the Picture Editor), a high school senior who works with teenagers, is trying to find the perfect present for the perfect boy she knows will be her best friend. She needs to choose between a penchant for art books on Tintagel and a ring from a story about an orphaned boy raised by wolves.

Daisy goes to the library for suggestions and finds a photo of a child in a wheelchair looking up at a painting of Tintagel Castle. This is the boy she wishes were the subject of her art book. 

Daisy thinks"," For example, here is a passage describing a scene of a ship being attacked by a pirate crew, “…and when the pirate who had captured him saw that it was not a warship, but a merchantman, his heart rose at the prospect of booty.” I could keep the dialogue and narrative description of the scene but would I be conveying the same essential idea that a pirate crew attacking a merchantman represents an opportunity to gain treasure? On reflection I realised that even though the pirates may seem outnumbering the merchantman, they are outnumbered in two other ways. Firstly, the merchantman carries more firearms than either the pirates or their opponent. Secondly, the merchantman has a well-trained crew of navigators who are both expert at using marine chronometers to plot the ship’s position relative to the moon, stars and sun, and extremely proficient at manning the various weapons on board, such as cannon and muskets. Therefore, even if the pirate fleet numbers in hundreds, the merchantman’s crew has the ability to inflict significant damage to the pirates in a short space of time. So why, despite these advantages, do they not succeed in capturing the merchantman? Here are some reasons. Firstly, while the merchantman may carry the most treasure (valued by the pirates as “a small fortune”), it is not an exceptionally large sum relative to the pirate fleet. Secondly, the pirate fleet is smaller than the merchantman. Thirdly, the merchantman"," 

For example in the following scene from the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, the protagonist Lord Henry Wotton, meets the painter James Whistler for the first time. 

Whistler was a strange-looking man. At first glance his aspect reminded me of a monkey, with its long thin face, its large, round, staring eyes, its heavy jaws and shifty, half-hidden expression. His features were oddly distorted; his mouth, thin, his nose, thick, his chin, weak. He was wearing a shabby grey overcoat which had once been red, a greasy flannel shirt, and a knitted tie of which the string was coming undone. He spoke in his thick, slow way, with an enormous Boston accent, and rubbed his hands together and gave little peeps of laughter, as if he found the whole thing very funny. 

As Lord Henry observes, Whistler is ""a strange-looking man"" and Lord Henry himself is not entirely convinced by Whistler's ""aspects"" remind him of a monkey, however Whistler's mouth ""appeared large and round and staring and his lips seemed thick and puffy"".  Whistler's ""features were oddly distorted; his mouth, thin, his nose, thick, his chin, weak.""  Lord Henry concludes, ""He seemed to possess a weakness in his chin.""  

However Lord Henry does concede """," The film adaptation of A Christmas Carol, for example, shot many scenes in which Scrooge could not see his future self walking up to him, so they deleted those scenes. Similarly, the book describes a scene in which Scrooge meets the Spirit of Christmas Past but the film only shows the Spirit of Christmas Present (who, I assume, would have a better memory of Christmas past). Scrooge asks the Spirit to reveal to him what happened to him in Christmas past, and the film removes this scene as well.

Scrooge also keeps a journal of his business failures, and it is this material that the screenwriters chose to reduce and condense. In the novel, the Spirit of Christmas Past explains that Scrooge’s journal is his “tomb” and that he keeps taking inventory of the things he owns. Scrooge keeps an annual inventory of his business failures, and the film trims out this scene as well.


One might suggest that we should strive to convey as much as possible of the text into film, but film contains a dynamic range of information which simply does not map onto the text. The book has an entirely different conception of what a Christmas Carol night consists of than the film does. The book describes a night where Scrooge is alone and sleeps in a bed surrounded by only his shadow, while the film describes a holiday party where we see and hear a wide range of people talking and interacting with Scrooge throughout"," In many ways this was helpful – I was able to condense my script.

My favourite example of this came in the middle of a very heated argument between two main characters, Lady Jane Grey and Lady Mary Dudley. Mary, an official in the royal household, had recently been sent by the king to visit one of his close friends, the Earl of Hertford. Jane, an aristocratic member of the Royal Household, was one of the daughters of Edward, King of England, and had just arrived in London to help her sister, Elizabeth, become Queen. 

Jane was opposed to the friendship between the earl and the king’s wife, and Mary was dispatched by her superiors at court to explain the benefits of the relationship.

Mary travelled incognito and presented herself to the Earl of Hertford at his country home. The couple spent a delightful afternoon together, riding and playing at court games, and Mary was convinced they were developing a deep and lasting friendship. 

But Jane knew better. She watched from the sidelines as Hertford’s young sons romped with the King’s sister, Elizabeth. The atmosphere in the room was one of jollity and camaraderie – not to mention alcohol-fuelled violence and debauchery – and the Earl of Hertford seemed oblivious to the dangerously thickset man whose hand he was patting on the back. The king was present, but he kept his"," In many cases I could remove text without noticeably reducing the comprehension level of the text. Conversely, in other scenes where there was a lot of description, I found I was losing sight of what the point of the scene was and instead just describing the visual beauty of the setting or the movement and attitude of the characters.

Below I’ve provided an example of a scene from ""Tender is the Flesh"" by O. Henry which has a lot of dialogue but is easy to read at a 5th grade level. I then provide the dialogue from the film version of the same story which is noticeably longer and is closer to an 8th grade level.

It took a couple of weeks to find the perfect place for the train. It was to be a farewell to Dora, the beautiful, beautiful Dora. The townspeople were going to gather on the platform to bid her a tearful farewell.

The beautiful Dora smiled, and the tears flowed. “It is the last train for the evening,” said the stationmaster, “if you want to catch it.”

“Not if I want to die of hunger,” said Dora. “When you are old and poor, and I am old and poor, you can buy me a bottle of liquor to take to my grave, and I will think of you and be glad. If I am ever old and poor and dying of hunger, you will not have sold me the last bottle","  I realized that this was because I was reducing the novel down to a skeleton of bare essentials, condensed the narrative into a few paragraphs, and then filling in the blanks with descriptive dialogue.  This is a process which almost always involves elimination of detail, both direct (e.g. characters telling of the size and colour of the eyes) and implied (e.g. the action taking place in the darkness).  It is not uncommon to end up with a summary of the essence of the novel with very little or no description at all.  Even worse is when the writer includes some description but the narrative content is not closely related to the character and setting of the novel.  

Here are some examples of dialogue and narrative content that I was able to eliminate to achieve the same effect.  These are from the novel ""Larklight"", written by Sue Monk Kidd.  I will note the point of the excerpt and then discuss the elimination process:

- ‘The first thing that struck me about them was that they were not men. They were so small, like children. And their skin was as white as paper, and their eyes were so blue, like the sky at noon when the sun shines straight into your eyes and you feel as if you can see right through to the other side. And their ears were small and pointed and pointy like the teeth of a animal. They were animals, all of them, that had somehow turned"

"," In the short term this could mean more extreme weather events, droughts, floods and heavy rain. Longer term there will be changes in the seasons and the length of the year. The sea level may rise and many coastal areas could be inundated by rising sea levels. This could have significant implications for people who live along the coastline. However some animals and plants will be able to migrate to cooler regions and there could be more diversity in species around the world. However as with most things in life there will also be winners and losers from climate change, certain animals or plant life could be able to move to higher ground so they can survive the effects of rising temperatures. Other plants or animals might not be able to move very far and will be adversely affected by the effects of climate change. The heat is on but will we let it get us?


The following is a story suitable for Grades 2 - 4 (ages 8 - 12):


The Heat is On

We’ve all heard of global warming but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives? 

Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. In the short term this could mean more extreme weather events, droughts, floods and heavy rain. Longer term there will be changes in the seasons and the"," Temperatures in London are likely to rise by 2 degrees Celsius which could make the cold winter months even colder. Snow might even start falling in Scotland and Switzerland due to the colder weather. In the UK the summer weather could get milder but in places like London, the weather might become very rainy and windy which could pose a serious problem in case of fires. 

The book ‘How to read’ offers five different levels and these can be used as a guide to help you develop your text. Each text level offers a different combination of text skills and these text skills are important for A2 readers. The text skills you need to develop your text are:
1. Vocabulary development (around 500 words): In this text level you will develop your vocabulary through use of important words and phrases.  
2. Analysis and explanation of text (around 150):  
3. Inference and evaluation of evidence (around 100):  
4. Production of text (around 500):  
5. Language and style (around 50):  

By using the book ‘How to read’ as a guide, you can develop a text that is suitable for A2 learners.  

  

The text can be written as an informative text (level 1) for information or knowledge exchange.  A factual account of the issue of global warming can be written at level 1 (or text level 1).

An analysis and explanation of the issue"," It will affect how much food there will be, how long the seasons will last and what will become of the wildlife that lives in warmer climates. If the temperature remains constant this could mean some very hot summers and more serious cold spells. On the other hand, if the world tries to put its warming foot on the brakes it might push the earth’s temperature even higher and create even more dangerous consequences. Some scientists believe that if the temperature continues to rise more significantly and more quickly than normal that our species could become extinct within a few generations. This is because the earth’s current temperature is considered to be favourable to the survival of human beings. But what do the experts really know? Many experts on this subject have done their best to come up with an accurate calculation of how much warmer it will get and what the consequences will be. Some people think that it will be worse than we thought, some say it will be worse and some say it will be better. That is because some people believe that more careful consideration has been given to the subject than others. So who is right? In order to find out, you might like to read about the different opinions given by experts on this subject. Then you could try and find out which of the opinions turn out to be the most convincing. 

This is a fictional story written by a Grade 2 reader. It is not a scientific report nor is it an opinion piece. It is a story based on some facts that are true but"," The number of extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and storms is certain to increase. The impact of these events will be more severe and unpredictable in a warmer world. For example, heat waves are expected to be more violent, leading to rises in death rates and health problems. It’s not only our own safety that is at risk, the climate might even change our species too. As warmer weather allows more insects to survive, they will eat more of our crops. In some parts of the world this will be a disaster for farmers as they lose their traditional diet. But although most of us know what global warming is, how much it will actually affect our lives is less clear. What will the warmer climate mean for your area?

Your characters are staying at a luxury hotel in the Swiss Alps. The weather is cold and rainy most days but there is a small pool on the hotel terrace where they usually go to swim. They have a bottle of wine and hot chocolate to warm up on the cold evenings. The hotel is located in a very picturesque location and the views are simply breath-taking. One evening, the weather breaks for the first time in months and the guests are treated to a beautiful sunny afternoon in the hotel’s pool. 

The weather stays sunny all week and the guests find that they have a lot of free time on their hands to enjoy all of the local hiking trails and beautiful nearby mountain lakes. They take cooking lessons from a local"," This might be good or bad. With more sunshine come more vitamin D and other good effects. Increased rain might cause droughts but also lead to more plant growth that could help with the problem of food shortages. Higher temperatures might mean that people can spend more time outside in the warm sunshine but it could also lead to higher mortality rates from heat stress. Some people worry that warming of the climate could lead to more extreme weather with more frequent storms, heavy downpours and more wildfires. It is a challenging subject with many unknowns and opinions and it will take many years to get a proper grasp on all the consequences. What do you think will be the most detrimental? Do you agree that this is a complex subject and there is much still to know? Your opinion is most welcome.   

#1  Increased mortality rates from heat stress:  This is the most detrimental effect mentioned by the text.  This is due to the fact that higher temperatures will lead to higher mortality rates from heat stress.  This is because higher temperatures increase heat stress because people are more vulnerable to heat stroke and dehydration at higher temperatures.  Increased mortality rates from heat stroke and dehydration will lead to a higher mortality rate from heat stress.  

#2  More extreme weather with more frequent storms, heavy downpours, and more wildfires: This is a sub-topic of global warming and refers to the increased likelihood of extreme weather such as more frequent storms, heavy downpours"," Extreme weather events are already starting to occur. These include more frequent and more damaging heatwaves, droughts and wildfires. In some areas this will lead to social crises and migration. There are also more dangerous natural hazards such as increased flooding. Other possible implications are more dangerous insects, pests and diseases.

" Some examples of maps are the following: The route you are about to take, the town you live in, a diagram showing your organs. 

A number of maps can also show the relationships between people, places, and things, creating networks. Networks of people, places, and things are increasingly used by organisations to manage their operations and interact with their customers. 

In the 20th century, mapping had a dramatic evolution. In the 19th century, cartography was largely determined by military and political interests. The invention of the camera obscura in the 16th century and the telescope in the 18th century paved the way for increasingly detailed images of the Earth. The invention of the airplane in the 1920s and the global positioning system in the 1970s further enhanced the potential for accurate mapping. In addition to military and political interests, mapping also expanded in response to the demand for exploration and development. Mapping technologies and methods have continued to develop and improve, particularly in the digital era. Today, a wide range of mapping platforms are available, including Google Earth, Google Maps, Apple Maps, HERE Maps, Bing Maps, and many more. 

The 21st century has seen a growing trend towards exploring mapping to understand, communicate, and improve organisational performance. Exploration of mapping can be done by mapping concepts, mapping culture, and mapping networks. A concept map is a graphic visualisation of mapping terms. Thematic mapping, also known as thematic exploration mapping, aims to","  A map consists of two elements: a display and a map plane. The map plane, or surface, shows the features, and the map’s projection is how the features appear on the map. Map projections are based on how a point near the earth’s surface is mapped onto a plane that is fixed in a geodetic reference frame. In cartography, a projection is an algorithm that translates non-orthographic (“flat”) map data, which can only be expressed in terms of distances and angles, into a two- or three-dimensional surface in which straight-line distances appear as segments with a constant angle. The simplest projections are a map’s stereographic projections, which use the formula z = x / R - c for the map projection, where z is the new, ordinate axis, x is the existing, abscissa axis, R is the radius of the Earth, and c is a constant. The constant c may be chosen so that the resulting projection lines all have the same angle. The most commonly used projection in cartography is the Mercator projection, which is named for the German cartographer Matthias Ringmann (1478–1555). It is defined by the equation x = Rp cos α, where x is the projection’s abscissa axis, Rp is the radius of the Earth in units of thePROJ_R_UNIT variable, and α is the angle of declination. The PROJ_R"," The most important thing to know is that on a map the features are always represented by geometric shapes made up of vertices or points and edges, and that the edges connect the vertices at specified angles. On a physical map, the edges might actually exist in the pages of the book. This is what is called an illusion of continuity. When someone points to something on a map, the user should recognize exactly where they are by looking at the map. 

So, from the text we know that a map is: 
1. A two-dimensional, graphical representation of two- or three-dimensional relations between geographically distinct features or entities.
2. Illusory (or feigned) of a continuous body of material
3. An aid to orientation 
4. A visual tool.

Here is a map that is also a physical map: 
http://www.mapworld.com/library/pdf/physical-map.pdf

It has three-dimensional features on a two-dimensional background, so it is both a graphical and a physical map.

This map also contains an illusion of continuity because different angles make different features appear to be touching, and the scale of the features (e.g. continents, towns, roads) can be changed to make the features smaller or larger and still be understood by looking at the map.

All the above point to a clear understanding that a map is a tool that can be used to"," Mapping is the science of locating, describing, and interpreting physical features. Maps may be created by hand or by using a variety of media, including the aid of computers, which may be programmed to produce digital versions. A map, whether hand-drawn or computer-generated, consists of four main components: the map outline, the key, the depiction of features or map symbols, and text labels. There are many different types of maps. Examples include street plans, topographic maps, aerial photography, and navigational charts. The format of a map is very important. There are many different formats: topographic map, a street plan of a city, an atlas, and a detailed topographic map of an area with notes. A topographic map usually shows all of the relevant topographic features (peaks, ridges, valleys, lakes, etc.) in sufficient detail to determine their location, height, and orientation. Some symbols are pictographs, and some are technical symbols or abbreviations. A pictograph is a symbol that is easily recognizable without the need for explanation. Technical symbols, or abbreviations, are used when the meaning is not immediately obvious from the context of the symbol. Symbols are often shown with different styles, for example, bold, bold-italic, or italic.

The following is a map created using different formats, including hand drawn and computer generated:

Different styles of symbols are used: bold, bold-italic, or"," We show the distance by lines called lines of distance. Distance is represented by straight or indirect lines called lines of route. We show direction by using symbols for right angles. These directions are given as directions of features. 

- Lines of distance - Lines of route - Symbols for right angles

The following are examples of maps:

- A street map of a city - A traffic flow diagram - A map of the solar system showing the locations of the planets, the sun, and the asteroid belt.

The following are common elements of maps:

- Points: In a map, these are typically the locations of streets, landmarks, or other points of interest.
- Features: These are the landmarks and other features of interest on the surface of the earth. These may be natural features like mountains or oceans or man-made features like roads or railways.
- Lines: These are the distances between and orientations between the points and features. 

Maps can be created using many types of media including aerial photography, satellite imaging, or even the human eye. They are often drawn using cartography, a special type of mapping. The following are some common cartographic elements:

- Projections: Maps are often drawn using the Mercator,  Galilean, or Azimuth projection. These are projections that preserve the shape of the earth's surface as it looked directly from above.
- Symbols for right angles: These are often used"," Distance can be represented by the length of a line connecting two points. Direction is shown by the use of arrows, usually indicating a vector.

" He was famous for his expeditions to Antarctica and for his leadership during the First World War. Yet while many Brits may be familiar with his background and achievements, they have very little idea of the man.

Shackleton was a complex, passionate and flawed human. He was born in 1867 to modest means in a mining community in County Down in Ireland. After failing an exam to study law, Shackleton tried his hand at geology, working in the quarries at Portmadoc in Wales. He joined the Royal Navy in 1888 and was quickly recognised for his aptitude for engineering and geological surveying. His aptitude and leadership skills saw him make an unusually fast ascent through the ranks. After serving during the First World War he was assigned a wide variety of new posts; from glaciological agent and lecturer at Oxford University to a post as assistant to the Chief Geologist on the staff of the Admiralty, an organisation with responsibilities for exploring and mapping the seafloor.

But Shackleton’s drive, enthusiasm and sense of adventure meant he was never completely comfortable with the trappings of power. He once famously quipped: “Power is like a boating trip: once you have started you never stop.” While some would say this was simply an Irish proverb, some see it as a more pointed comment on the pitfalls of power and its addictive nature. 

By the 1920s Shackleton was leading three Antarctic expeditions"," That is changing thanks to the BBC series “Heroes of the Sea”, which has been recommissioned for a second series. It portrays Shackleton’s Antarctic voyage in the early 20th century, when he led a mission to resupply the isolated British camp at Elephant Island, where he died of hunger and exposure. The drama’s success has led to its portrayal of the expedition spreading to include the story of his earlier shipwreck on the rocky Antarctic continent. He was an explorer of great bravery, perseverance and daring, said Alistair Farrant, a professor of international management at Aston Business School in Birmingham. “He is now being recognised and admired in the business world in the UK and the US because the series was so successful.” That means he is spreading to a wider circle of people than just Brits who are fascinated by exploration. His model of good management is now being adopted by American executives, with one example being the Chief Digital Officer at Southwest Airlines, Chris Amon. “Ernest Shackleton and his team of explorer buddies are a role model for me and my team because they were willing to put themselves in harms way to accomplish a goal. It is a lesson we can all learn to do the same in today’s demanding and complex digital age.” While “Heroes of the Sea” is bringing the story of Shackleton’s Antarctic voyage to a wider audience, it is also"," To this day, many do not know the name of the man who led the greatest sea rescue of all time. 

Shackleton is best known for his exploits on the southern polar expedition during the mid-19th century. He is now largely remembered as the founder of the Antarctic Treaty System, an international agreement to preserve the environment and protect vulnerable habitats. 

While it's true that Shackleton was an international business leader who used leadership and management skills to save his crew, the real hero of this story is not a business man but a people person. 

Many will now remember Ernest Shackleton as a person who led some of the greatest sea rescues in history, but people at the time did not know him or his actions. Shackleton was not known as an executive in the early 1900s. In fact, his name was not even heard outside of the South Pole area until three years after his death. And when it was, Shackleton was well into his 70s. 

Even after he was recognized as a legend, Shackleton's role in leading the expedition that discovered the Islands of the South Polar Continent was not widely known or celebrated at the time. For those who knew his name, it was probably in connection to one of the many ways in which Shackleton was famous for being a ""people person."" He was a motivator and he was able to inspire the men on his ship, the Endurance, to per"," His achievements include setting a record for Antarctic survival and leading a ship over which he took the crew under deadly icebergs to find and rescue survivors of the ship's Antarctic expedition. The British public know of his valour but not his humility, as he once said that he felt like a fish out of water when he arrived in Berlin. As a result of his efforts to rescue some of the party from a ship trapped in the Antarctic, he was knighted. Shackleton is now a model of good management in the United States. In America it is not unusual for middle management to set challenging, but realistic, goals for the company. One executive said that he wanted to increase the number of ""people"" in the company by one each day. The average manager in America has about 12 ""people"" in their group, so one day per month would be a reasonable goal. Another executive said that they wanted to double the number of customers in their company within five years. While these goals may seem unrealistic to a European, they are not to an American. To Americans, the goals are just two numbers out of a range that can vary from six to six hundred with a step size of 50 and with some goals being impossible to reach. As a result of this model of management, the American company is ahead of its competitors in the long term. However, Shackleton is perhaps an unfair model. To European ears, the phrase ""people person"" sounds grandiose and self-obs"," Some know his role in the second world war, rescuing ships and the crew of. Most know he was an explorer who went missing at sea with his crew and that he was born in Pennsylvania but almost all do not know much about him. Shackleton went to sea as a young man, perhaps looking for adventure. He was hired by a Liverpool shipping company and signed up 40 or so seamen to join him. The ship got caught in a storm in the Antarctic and as they waited for rescue in the harsh conditions, Shackleton tried to keep the men calm. He told them what he knew of how to survive in the Arctic. He wrote down maps so they would have reference for their location in the vast and icy wilderness. When the rescue ship finally came, Shackleton ordered his men to row to shore while he stayed in the ship. The men rowed across the sea to the shore with nothing but pieces of clothing and their boots. They landed safely in South Georgia, a nearby island, but Shackleton was never seen again. He and his crew survived the world’s deadliest polar expedition. His bravery and leadership made a huge difference to the survival of the crew and changed the course of world history. His example of how good leaders can inspire their people to succeed in the most challenging of circumstances has remained an inspiration to people around the globe ever since. He was honoured with a special award by President Barack Obama and is remembered as an inspiration to people","  But even so, people may need to know a little more about him to understand why he is being increasingly adopted as a good management style by American executives.  

The polar explorer Ernest Shackleton is a good example of someone who changed the face of management. In 1857 Shackleton set sail from Southampton, England with nine other men in the ill-fated endeavour to reach the island of South Georgia and return.  On this voyage seven men died of hunger, thirst, exposure and disease.  The last man to survive the shipwreck returned home with a skull fracture and reported later that the crew's only comfort had been drinking the blood of their injured mate, who they had tried to save.

On reflection, Shackleton realised that the men he was trying to rescue were probably better off left to their fate.  On the other hand, he took on the responsibility of leading a team of seven to a new and challenging destination, and he persevered despite adverse circumstances.  This is the polar explorer model of good management.  This style of leadership has become more prevalent in modern business and is beginning to influence corporate governance in the UK.  The polar explorer model was adopted in the UK by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the UK Cabinet Office.  But it was Shackleton's remarkable achievements on the ice floes of the South Atlantic Ocean that made him a hero in his own time.

Sh"," Perhaps a person’s favourite British admiral, Horatio Nelson, is the most famous person Shackleton worked for and for whom he worked – but not much more than that.

Ernest Shackleton was a polar explorer. He led a 1916 voyage on the ship Endurance, which was eventually crushed by ice but which he survived. Since then, Shackleton has written a biography and a number of books about polar exploration and maritime survival, but he is now better known for his management style. He has been described by a number of business leaders as an exemplar of good management. People from American companies have also recently spoken of him in this way, and in the spirit of polar exploration there is a great deal of research currently going into how to manage effectively across the polar regions, where most of the world’s ice is. 

One area that Shackleton has focused on is the way in which people work across cultures. The polar regions are often vast and incomparably more harsh and challenging than the lands and seas people are used to, and it is often people who live there who set out to explore these lands and seas. This means that people who work across cultures, and people who work in polar exploration at all, often have little or no prior contact with one another. Shackleton, by contrast, worked on a multinational scale, and was used to communicating effectively in ways that often transcended national boundaries.

" In particular the advent of new recording devices such as the home stereo and boom box gave rise to the generation of home music studios.  This allowed the development of home based bands with the potential for commercial success. These artists could be paid a royalty on record sales for the use of their music in popular songs, but there was also the opportunity for independent artists to achieve recognition and even fortune.  While the commercial music industry was developing there was also a thriving world of fan clubs, record swap meets and specialist magazines. Many of these organisations had websites which provided a central place to find information about particular artists and their music. 

The music business was dominated by a few major record companies who created a narrow genre of popular music whose artists they promoted and paid royalties to.  Artists could choose to record for one of the major labels or be independent and operate at the fringes of the industry. Independent artists often had to work hard to be discovered, promoted and paid for their work.   

In recent years internet radio and podcasts have impacted music as never before. The ease with which anyone can record sound and publish it on the internet offers artists an audience they could never have had before. Podcasts have a narrow genre of music and are frequently produced by fans who feel strongly enough about the subject to record a pod of their own. 

Changes to the law and the introduction of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has had an impact on online copyright infringements. This has forced"," For many people, music was a key part of their leisure time and they sought and valued a combination of its accessibility, pleasure value, and ability to provide social interaction. This development also presented challenges, for example, it meant that music had to compete with other forms of entertainment including television and radio.   

While there was an increase in the number of radio stations available, records sales had increased faster and music became more commercially viable. But at the same time, the number of music compositions became more restricted, making it difficult for people to express their original ideas. Despite these challenges, many popular artists broke through to a mass audience, as record sales increased this was driven in part by effective marketing, but also by a desire to experience new styles and to find an escape from the pressures of daily life. Technology had a role to play in the development of music in Britain as new technologies developed at pace with the music world. Music production was initially dominated by vinyl records (called 78s when they were first invented) which offered great durability. Later on, cassette tapes offered a similar experience for much of the population but they were not as durable as vinyl records. CDs became the norm for music consumption, offering both durability and unlimited listening.

  * Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain. 
    * Susan Hallam is a professor of history at the University of East Anglia and has conducted research into popular music and the recording industry since the 1960s.  Her latest book"," One outcome of this was that it led to a proliferation of genres or styles of music. One of the most significant developments was the advent of rock 'n' roll, which came at a time when it was easy to go to the local town and spend a few pounds on a pair of good earphones and with them be able to enjoy any available record store stock of rock 'n' roll 78 rpm records. From this we can see how music is no longer just listened to it is produced and consumed. Another important development was the emergence of electronic music in the early 1970's - acid house and techno were created by a range of electronic instruments that added extra beats to a record or just created a new sound. This gave rise to house music and in turn to techno. The advent of the CD album became a key development that allowed the consumer to have many, many songs from many, many bands and individuals. Along with this came the internet where digital audio files could be shared and downloaded. This presented new challenges for the industry who needed to develop new ways to promote their artists and distribute their product. This meant an increase in the size and scope of the music industry, and in the early 2000's an entirely new model was introduced - the download. This is now an accepted part of how people consume music and have been for many years. There is also the increased use of mobile technology such as smartphones, which allows consumers to listen to their music in unique ways that weren't possible previously"," It was not long before these new ways of listening to music led to a demand for musicians. While this in itself posed no particular problem in a country with a long history of organised music making we found that there was a demand for musicians to perform songs that had not previously been written down for an audience that had not previously heard the song. This meant that musicians needed to write new songs to reflect the needs of this audience. Since there were now more opportunities for individuals to compose and perform music it would of course be natural to assume that there were more songs written. Although there have been numerous studies looking into songwriting it is not readily possible to quantify the number of new songs created. What we do know is that the number of new songs created outstripped the demand for musicians leading to a decline in the number of recorded music performances. 

Use the following text to write a short piece of writing for a Grade 2 learner.

New songwriting opportunities have led to a demand for musicians in Britain. This in turn has led to a decline in the number of recorded music performances. This has meant that more songs were created. However this meant that there were more songs written than there were recorded musicians. This phenomenon led to music becoming more difficult to quantify. 

Music has been recorded for generations and can be analysed to look at different attributes such as how many times a song is sung or the instruments played. A song can be written down for a specific purpose and performed for an"," As a result there are now many different styles, types and genres of music available to the population of Britain. In the 1950s there were around 50,000 independent labels and less than 2,000 recorded music artists. Today the number of independent labels alone is over 80,000. Music has a major part to play in our lives. It is part of everyday activities such as eating sleep and exercise. It plays a key part in our social lives as we enjoy listening to music and talking about music. It is one of the main ways we spend our leisure time and helps us relax and makes us feel happy. The number of recorded music artists alone is now over 3 million. The development of the recorded music industry is one that has attracted much interest amongst historians. The recording industry has changed how music is produced what music is available to the public music styles and genres. The recording industry has also changed how music is consumed - how it is listened to, how it is made available and how it is shared. Some people feel that the development of the recording industry has made music less available to the public. There has been much debate about how digital technology is changing this and will change it in the future. The development of the recording industry has been accompanied by the development of other related industries such as music distribution and management. The recording industry is also involved in some aspects of online media that it produces and manages. This has included the creation of online radio stations and television channels. It has also created fan","  

Music - The Challenge Ahead  The 1960's-70's marked a turning point in the development of music in Britain.  This was a period where the new recording techniques and technology produced a massive increase in the amount of music recorded.  A combination of the new recording equipment and better recording techniques resulted in a large increase in the availability of material for radio, TV, video and LP records.  

Music - The Challenge Ahead  However, despite this increase in availability there was a noticeable shortage of recordings for many leading recording artists of the day.  This shortage was exacerbated by the fact that many leading recording artists also had high public demand for recordings and thus recordings were in high demand.  

Music - The Challenge Ahead  This resulted in many small independent record companies coming into existence which helped the shortage of recordings for artists.  These small record companies often had only one or two artists recording for their label.  This increased the competition for recordings which resulted in the lower prices for recordings.  

Music - The Challenge Ahead  In addition, the advent of radio TV records tapes CDs videos and multi-media techniques brought streaming media which meant music could be easily accessed at a moment's notice from a wide range of sources.  This meant that listeners had the ability to select and play music from a computer a mobile phone iPod or even from the car radio.  

Music - The Challenge Ahead  It also meant that the need for"," In the 1970s, the birth year of David Bowie, record sales were boosted by MTV which introduced teenagers to an alternative choice of music from soul to rock to hip-hop. There was a marked increase in the range of instruments available, and the recording of music live was made possible by multi-track recording. All these changes affected the nature of the music itself, which changed from pop to rock to progressive to alternative and dub. As one example, in the early 1970s Ravi Shankar studied the sitar with Brian Eno. He created the band, Spoken Word. In the 1990s, the group Dizzee Rascal was founded on beatboxing. In the 21st century, with the advent of the internet musicians who were already famous became even more famous by collaborating with others who were less famous, yet still capable of providing content that the public wanted. In this way, YouTube became the first search engine for music.  This new availability of music through a variety of media had an effect on the way in which musicians composed music and the use of instruments. The synthesizer allowed for the introduction of new instruments and allowed for new approaches to the way in which musicians composed music.  The advent of the synthesizer meant that more musicians could compose music for their instruments, previously unavailable to them.


Music - The Challenge Ahead Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their"
" And of course the stories in books are written by other humans, so we can read them to better ourselves, or perhaps simply to enjoy the beauty of language. 

But summer can also be a time of year where it’s hard to focus on reading, because we’re out in the fresh air and the great outdoors rather than stuck indoors, with the exception of a few short vacation days. This is the ideal moment to get outside and read, but also the moment when we need to be especially mindful of our use of technology. We know that spending time reading in nature can help us to fall in love with the world around us and appreciate it more, but we’ve also learned that too much screen time can cause attention disorders that can affect us physically and mentally. 

In the months to come, be aware of how much screen time you engage in each day, and when you use your free time for that purpose, try to put aside time each day to read something novel. It could be a book that you purchase, find on a bookshelf, or download from the internet. There’s an app called Shelf Observers which lets you catalogue and save books for future reading, and then you can take a look at what you’ve saved in a book app to see if any of the books are still available for purchase. 

I hope this is helpful. Enjoy summer, and good reading!

I will give you my reading"," In reading books we escape the monotony of family life or our work and learn of new lands and people. Moreover, the stories may teach us important lessons - good or bad - which makes them an important source of education. Reading a book is like hearing a lecture on a subject delivered by a master orator. It allows us to grasp ideas more easily than if we were only given the information in a lecture. 

What does it mean to “escape the monotony of family life or our work and learn of new lands and people” and “have important lessons from good or bad books”?  

The idea of escaping “the monotony of family life or our work and learn of new lands and people” might strike some readers as fanciful or even impossible.  But consider the children in 19th century Australia who worked on farms or in factories but had very little contact with adults or other children. They may have read and internalized the “no children under six” rule from the era.  They were forbidden to spend time with other children, and so they did not become children themselves. These children did not become “at home in the world at large” because they did not have access to books.

Similarly, young people work and study today may become “at home in the world at large” by reading books, but not necessarily in the same way that children who read books could become “at home in the world at large.”  A more practical and realistic"," This is what makes books such great escape. The more we read of great stories, the more we discover of the infinite diversity of human cultures and their triumphs and tragedies. Reading books is the first great human invention - as important, though often misunderstood, as the language. Even so, many people are only occasionally tempted to pick up a book or two from the library or the bookshop, but don’t get around to doing it. The great books remain undiscovered and unloved. To change that, we must open a book ourselves and become its hero or heroine - but what book would that be? 

The main characters in books usually aren’t like you or me, and they come from all sorts of places and cultures. For these reasons and more, the books remain hidden from us. We are a tiny minority in this world that knows only of great books - those that become classics and those that remain buried in the shelves of thelibrary. Our task is to find them and bring them to light. Our hero, then, could well be that rare and special human who does just that. Her name is Hermione Granger from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Aren’t you proud of yourself for reading that book? 

Let us now create our own hero, a rare and special human who finds great books. 

Our hero is Hermione Granger, a junior at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"," We can see ourselves in the heroes and heroines of books and thus put ourselves in their positions. Books may even help us to grow as people; reading them may make us more empathic, more humane. But if all this reading is not occurring in the home, perhaps the community or the school could sponsor a “book in the park” or “book in the hood” event. Some organizations also sponsor events at local libraries in which members are invited to bring a novel of their own and everyone gets a copy of the novel. It would be a wonderful opportunity for children to share books they are reading and engage with those who have not yet read the book or to exchange books if both groups like what they see in the book. 

Use this website to search for books for your community to read in parks and in libraries: https://www.publicbooks.org/catalog/home.aspx.

  Here is an example of a story that is readable by Grade 2 learners using the prompt above:

On Saturday after school, a team of students led a book distribution at their local library.
“This summer, many parents sent us books to read at home. We were able to read many amazing books like “The Story of a Long Hair”, “Strange Inheritance” and more,” said Sadie. “But the best one is “The White Cat,” by Michael Rosen. It is about a young girl who lives in the mountains and is the"," We can be transported to far-off lands or explore a new culture and try to glimpse what it is like to live their daily lives through the eyes of the great authors whose works we now own. Many children and parents relish these feelings of adventure, wonder and discovery we get from reading. This, then, is one reason why children spend more time reading than any other activity or hobby. They enjoy reading more than any other hobby or hobby-like activity. Summer is the perfect time to read, as most children (and adults) are off school and out of the house, looking to spend their free time on the fun stuff: swimming, going to the beach, going on camping trips, playing outside, etc. Parents are free to read books to their children - whether on vacation or at home. In fact, many people use books to do things like read to a sick child or help alleviate boredom when it’s just the two of them at home. But what to read? And where to read it? Here are some ideas for summer reading that may appeal to both young and old readers, depending on what your taste is: - A children’s book that is based on a theme that resonates with you, such as animals or water: - A young adult book set in the future or at different time periods: - A book on a topic that you’re interested in but haven’t had the opportunity to learn about in school: - A book on a topic"," We find in books a comfort, an assurance that we share an origin and a destiny with all living things. 

Our summer reading has us look at books for fun, and more importantly, books that will improve our lives. 

I’d like to read books in which the author tells a story. They should be lively. My brain will need a good workout. Books that offer both a plot and a theme should be read. We want to be challenged intellectually and also entertained. Our summer reading will include books that are both thought provoking and fun.

We have many choices of great books that offer both theme and plot.

Harry Potter is a series of seven books written by British author J. K. Rowling. The books tells the story of a wizard who has just received a letter from Hogwarts School, stating that he’s been accepted as the new head of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This excites the wizard so he leaves his comfortable quarters to travel to Hogwarts, but while en route his carriage is attacked by Voldemort’s horcruxes, resulting in him losing his arm.

It’s at Hogwarts that Harry comes across the Triwizard Tournament where three tasks have to be done in three years. During these years, he meets the seven heroes of the Harry Potter stories and learns that there is more than just magic at work in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There are other types of students: Ravenous Vault-Digging Beetle-Stalks, Slytherin Snakes, Gryffindors with big ears and Slytherins with even bigger ears are but a few examples of the many kinds of people found in Hogwarts. 

There is also another type of student: Hufflepuff"
" Photographs are therefore very much tied to who the photographer is, they reflect his or her values and world view. However, when we look at photographs there are certain patterns that can be observed that show up in the photographs even if they are not intentionally planned by the photographer. 

One such pattern that can be observed in photographs is repetition. In photographs there is usually repetition of certain visual elements such as the same setting, the same objects or people, the same background or the same light conditions. There are a number of reasons for this but one of the most important is that humans find it difficult to process information that is not unique. When we see a familiar object or setting we are more likely to process the information faster and more accurately. Furthermore, the human visual system is very efficient in detecting and responding to visual information of which we are aware. The brain is also able to extract patterns from the information it processes. Pattern recognition is a fundamental process that we all use to a certain degree but if a pattern is used over and over again it can be easier for the brain to detect and process.

The result is a selection of a visual representation that is both aesthetically pleasing and useful for the intended purpose. This is because the photograph is a combination of the visual information that the photographer chose to photograph, and the technical aspects that were used to create the photograph such as the type of camera used, the aperture used to let in light to the camera, ISO settings used to capture the image, and the settings of the shutter speed and the exposure time. The technical aspects include how fast the shutter is able to close allowing light into the camera and the film or film emulsions to capture the image. When someone looks at a photograph there are many things that can make people feel different feelings ofjoy, pride, sorrow, or nostalgia. Some things that people may do when looking at a photograph include discuss the content with others, or make notes about specific parts of the photograph. A key element in photography is the process of taking a photograph the technical and visual information that makes up the photograph. When someone takes a photograph the technical aspects of taking photographs involves bringing the appropriate exposure settings to record a visual representation of the subject matter in the photograph. When a subject matter in the photograph is far from the settings that are used the result will be either an underexposure or overexposure of the subject. When the subject matter in the photograph is in"," A photograph has a number of components the technical information of how the camera was set up what type of lens was used what settings were used to take the photograph and any further information such as a GPS coordinate that is embedded in the digital photograph the information within the photograph may be broken down into three elements the brightest aspect of the image the middle of the image and the darkest portion of the image. The technical information about the lens and settings used determines what aperture was used in the lens for the photographer to select what the aperture is a means of stopping the amount of light that gets into the lens from reaching the film or digital sensor in the camera it can be stopped at a range of ratios this range is known as f-stop. At the aperture used the technical information is combined with the photographer's personal views to make the photographer's selection of what aspect of the image to focus on the middle of the image or the closest object in the scene that is in focus that aspect will become the selected focus. The technical information is also combined with the photographer's personal views and the social and cultural norms of the people in the country where the photographer is operating this information creates an expectations that the photographer is able to incorporate into his or her decision making about what to focus on.

Some photographs include text and this can be a useful additional tool that the viewer can use to learn more about the subject. An example of this is the use of text in a photograph to provide further information about the location that the photograph was taken in. 

Use your knowledge of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale to write an answer which is suitable for Grade 2 readers.


The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scale 
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scales are designed to provide a quantitative measurement of the reading level of various documents in order to allow them to be graded appropriately for different ability levels.  The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is composed of four values (Flesch readability, equivalent full text, ideal full text and arithmetic) which are assigned to different types of text.  These values are calculated by taking into account a number of factors including the number of sentences in the text, the number of words per sentence, the number of syllables per word and the number of characters per word.


Assess the following text using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale: 
""Photography When a photographer takes a photograph he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills personal views and"," The photographer’s selection of visual information is then a visible representation of the photographer’s creative vision and is interpreted by the viewer to create his or her personal experience.

In the above story the author makes reference to two concepts that are defined in the CEFR scale as CE and F. The concepts are: CE – Cultural awareness (cultural context) and F – Freedom of expression. In this story the concepts of cultural awareness and Freedom of expression are intertwined because of how the author perceives these words in his or her cultural context. 

The author expresses a personal experience of freedom of expression in which he or she can express their personal opinions on art works that are displayed in public spaces like museums. The author states that they experience this freedom of expression in their cultural and social context. By using the words: “Freedom of expression” the author is referencing both the concept of Freedom of expression as defined in the CEFR scale and the personal experience of freedom of expression that the author experiences in their cultural and social context. 

The author’s experience of freedom of expression is a representation of his or her cultural context and is a type of cultural awareness that can be measured by using the CEFR scale. The author’s experience of freedom of expression could be interpreted as an expression of their personal aesthetic vision and is a type of freedom of expression that can be derived from a personal aesthetic vision. 

The author’s personal experience of freedom of"," The image that is selected and produced is limited by both the technical and aesthetic skills of the photographer and the technical quality of the available equipment. The photographer’s decision to focus on a particular area or to avoid focusing on an area has a large impact on the aesthetic quality of the final photograph. Technical and aesthetic skills allow for a high quality selection of visual information that is then presented to the viewer in an effective way. 

Some of the technical and aesthetic skills that a photographer uses include aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focal length and focal plane, focus, background, composition and lighting. These technical skills interact with each other and the aesthetic decisions that the photographer makes will determine what are the best combination of technical and aesthetic skills to produce a high quality image. Technical and aesthetic skills are learned and practiced over time and it is important that the photographers reflect on their practice in order to improve their technical and aesthetic skills and the quality of their photographs. 

It is helpful to think about photographic images from different cultural and social contexts. These contextual differences can be related to the photographer’s technical and aesthetic skills and the photographer’s own personal views and experience. For example, different photographers may use different focal lengths to show the same scene from a bird’s eye view, close up and from the side. Some photographers may choose to focus on particular objects, animals or people in their images. Some photographers may use a wide aperture to blur the background and capture a more dynamic scene. Some photographers"," The selection of visual information is then converted into a form of electromagnetic radiation that can be stored on a photosensitive medium. In this way photographs are created. The technical and aesthetic selection of visual information is one of the most important aspects of photography. A good photograph will attract the interest of the viewer and it will show the photographer’s skills. The technical and aesthetic selection of visual information  can also be expressed by the use of technical terms and phrases that can be memorised by people who do not necessarily have a degree in photography. The technical and aesthetic selection of visual information can also be expressed by the use of technical terms and phrases that can be memorised by people who do not necessarily have a degree in photography. Photographers should understand how light reaches the photosensitive medium when a photograph is taken and should understand the chemical reactions that take place in the photosensitive medium when a photograph is taken. They should also understand which physical properties of the medium give the photograph its colour, its texture and its shape. This technical and aesthetic selection of visual information is then converted into a form of electromagnetic radiation that can be stored on a photosensitive medium. In this way photographs are created. This knowledge can be taught through various educational formats for example lectures in universities or through seminars organised by professional organisations.


The following are examples of phrases that can be memorised by non-degree level people: aperture, shutter speed, ISO, film. A2 learners use these phrases when asked to define a particular concept. Some examples"
" We’d been out for the day, a rare treat for a girl from a middle-class family who usually was chaperoned to school. My father had been trying to convince the driver to let us off at the next set of lights, just before the Junction 12 flyover, but the man behind the wheel had refused to break. Maurice had been arguing, saying that there wasn’t any point going on any further, that it looked as if it would be a LONG journey. In the end my father had given up and pulled over. Then he got out of the car, walked around to the passenger side and opened the door for me. But he had no interest in Maurice. He was furious. He started yelling at the driver, calling him a foul name, demanding that we leave right now or else he’d call the police and have him arrested. I watched in horror as my father raised his hand to punch the man. Maurice began to scream for me to run. The man grabbed him by the arm and Maurice began crying. Then we saw it. The man reached into his coat and pulled out what looked like a gun. I started running back to the car and banged on the windows. My father saw me and threw his arm around me and started yelling at the man to give him back his gun. Maurice was screaming his head off. The man kept telling my father that he had the right to have his gun back because he had paid for it, that"," It was now clear that the ‘look here it is’ had not been the right phrase from the beginning. I could see we were going to get a very different reaction to the one we’d anticipated. ‘Don’t be so bloody rude!’ shouted my mother. ‘That will be the day!’ she added meaningfully. ‘We’ve been driving for ages!’ I replied, and I’m sure they all agreed. ‘Yes well look! I’ve said I’m not happy with the car so we’re going to get a new one.’ ‘A new one!?’ ‘Yes. A new one!’ ‘That’s no good! Look you’re upset. I’m sorry.’ ‘We are not upset. Look its no good! The car we have is no good!’ ‘Well. Then we’ll get a new car. It’s no use saying it’s no good!’ ‘No, it is. It’s no good!’ And they all started laughing at me and my poor trunk. ‘Well that’s the very end of that!’ said my father in exasperation. ‘There’s no need for that!’ I remonstrated. They just smiled at me as if to say ‘Oh well, that’s the way’. And off we went. 

The story that follows follows this prompt. Please try to keep your reader’s attention to the following prompt:

Family Business ‘","  ‘I’ve just been on the radio and I was really rude,’ he confessed. ‘I think they are on to me and they are going to fire me soon.’ I laughed. ‘How could you be fired?’ I asked. He said that I was supposed to be talking about how he and my brother had set up their family business a decade ago and now they were running out of money. I said I’d talk about that, but only if he agreed to drive us back to London. He agreed, even though he was now worried about his job. ‘I can’t afford a lawyer and I doubt I would win,’ he said. When we arrived back at our office my brother and I were delighted to find out that Dad was not going to get fired. Instead, he was being rewarded and was going to be awarded a new BMW 3-series. ‘You can have the car and I’ll manage the business,’ he smiled.  

Here are a few key points to help you write this story:

1. The story should begin with a quote from the character who is talking about his or her emotions at the moment. Here is the quote from my Dad, which you could use:  ‘I’m worried about my job because I’m sure I’ll get fired any minute now!’

2. Then the story should progress into a scene, describing what happens next. Here is the scene my Dad shares with my"," ‘You’ve said the word family a thousand times in these last few hours but now I think you’ve said it too many times. You need to use the right words. I’ve worked hard all my life so that I could give you a better life than I had as a child. I can’t do that if you go off on one every time I say it.’ I wanted to argue, or at least express my annoyance but I was worried I would be shouted at by both of my parents at the same time. I was right to be worried because that’s exactly what happened. My father turned to my brother Maurice and said: ‘What is going on, Maurice? You haven’t said two words to her all day. Have you gone crazy? Tell them what you have been doing all day.’ It was at this moment that I realised I had lost the argument and my patience had also been lost. I didn’t argue anymore. The truth was that I had spent the entire day on the phone to my best friend, Kate, and I was still there when my parents pulled up in the car. They hadn’t stopped talking. It wasn’t really possible to stop your brain once you were talking to someone. So my only option was to find a way of distracting both of my parents from talking to me. This is what I did. I went into the house, shut the door and texted Kate to tell her about the day"," It had seemed the right move at the time, but it had turned out to be a huge mistake. 
  “Don’t say that, it’s not good, I’ve spent over a thousand pounds on lawyers. Let’s find a pub and raise a drink,” he suggested, as we navigated round one of the famous roundabouts in London. 
  It was the middle of the night and my parents had asked me to spend the night at their country home. I had agreed. My brother and I had split for the night with my parents in the car, and I was now sitting in the living room next to this glass coffee table. When I looked at it I realised it was full of empty bottles of alcohol of the local pubs we had visited. 
  I was furious. “What the hell are you doing?” I snapped. 
  My dad smiled. “Trying to make a few pennies. I thought if we parked up at the pub for a few hours and got it ready for a party, we could pocket an extra few hundred pounds.” 
  “Oh come on, Dad, you know I don’t drink,” I protested.
  “That’s OK, son, it’s your choice. But Maurice does, and he thinks it would be fun for all of us. We all like to drink, don’t we, Maurice?” 
  Maurice nodded. “Yes dad, but we"," ‘That’s enough. We’re going home.’ The family business ‘Look here it’s no good!’ was going nowhere. 
The family business consisted of my father, my brother Maurice, the eldest son, and me. My dad was the principal shareholder. ‘It’s no good,’ he was arguing with his brother, ‘the new partners don’t like our current business strategy. It’s going to be tough getting the old guys off the bank. They’re going to want their cash back and I’m going to have to pay up front.’ ‘I can’t afford that,’ my brother replied. ‘And why should I?’ ‘But we’ve already invested in the business, why should we lose out?’ ‘But you didn’t invest any money in the business. That’s why we split the business up. I put my money in the company, you put the money from your allowance.’ My brother was trying to be reasonable, but I could tell his patience was wearing thin. My dad was losing his temper, too. 
I could feel the heat rising in my body. It was very hot in the car, and I was already beginning to sweat. My uncle Maurice put his hand on my brother’s shoulder. My uncle was a wise head on the family business. He’d been a part of it since the beginning. ‘Look,’ he said in his deep voice, ‘we all put our money"," I had been sent to the school by Mum who wanted me to experience what it was like to be at school for a few hours, and be socialised, to get me used to living in the family business. They probably assumed that in a few years I would have left home to be a real partner to them. 
“Look at the view, isn’t it lovely?” Maurice said, as we drove. 
“It’s a bit corporate,” said Dad, “You’re not going to get much adventure from this school.” 
“No thanks, Dad, I want to go to the school I attended,” I replied as I opened my briefcase to pack my things away. I had only been back from school a few hours and had an assembly to look forward to. I was pretty excited about the school, even though it was more of a posh girls’ school than the one in London, and Maurice and I were being sent to the posh girls’ school, not the one I wanted to go to.

""I am a tourist,"" I said. 

She smiled. 

""You are a beautiful tourist,"" she said. 

""Thank you,"" I said, feeling embarrassed. ""I can see that you must not be from Vancouver."" 

She shook her head. 

""No, I am originally from Taiwan. I am originally from the city of Taipei."" 

""Oh,"" I said, my face brightening. ""I used to know a few words in Mandarin from speaking with the friends I made in school. It would be interesting to speak that language with someone from your own country, so to speak."" 

She smiled, showing a few missing teeth. 

""I am learning,"" she said. ""It is very difficult to pronounce English with my Russian accent, but I am trying.""

However there is only one language that is commonly heard. It is known as English in Vancouver and many residents are proficient in this language. 

Language is a tool of communication invented by our species to facilitate survival. Whether it's the expression of ideas, the exchange of information, or the sharing of emotions. It is essential for people to be able to communicate with one another, which is why the emergence of hundreds of thousands of different languages around the world is an incredible feat. 

The use of language is often considered to be innate and something that we are born with. However there is a wealth of evidence that it is heavily influenced by our environment and how we are rewarded for using language. Even small children will choose to speak in the language they are most comfortable with. Language can also be learned. 

Vancouver has a diverse population of people of many nationalities, speaking many different languages. It is one of the most multicultural cities in the world and this is clearly shown by the number of different languages that you hear on any given day. 

Many of the migrants that have arrived in the city for economic reasons speak English, a language which is easy to understand, concise, and has a vast number of words to express almost any concept that one could imagine. In fact, if you were to meet someone who does"," Based on the reading level of the language it is spoken, you might wonder why there is such a variance in the reading levels of the written languages spoken in Vancouver. The answer lies in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale which measures how easy it is to read a text based on how much text needs to be turned to read the entire passage. The higher the grade level in a text the less text is needed to be turned to fully understand the passage. Based on this scale French, Spanish, Italian and Arabic have very easy reading levels while Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and Korean have high reading levels. English on the other hand has a mid level reading grade level. 

Based on the example text provided and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale, the reading level of the last passage is a mid grade level. Based on the prompt it is safe to assume that the text is intended for Grade 2 learners in the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale and could be written to a grade 2 standard.


## Story

Vancouver has the highest population density of any city in the world, with over one hundred thousand people living in the downtown core. The large number of people living in close proximity to each other has led to the variety of languages spoken in Vancouver. You may hear Spanish, French or Chinese when people from all over the world have settled in Vancouver. 

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale is"," You might hear: 

Portuguese  
German  
Mandarin  
 Spanish  
Italian  
 Korean 

Which of these languages can be found in Vancouver today? 
Portuguese, German, Mandarin and Spanish are from Europe. Italian and Korean are from Asia. The number of speakers in each language is very small and many have now either been displaced by other languages or died out. It is therefore likely that there are very few speakers of Italian or Korean in Vancouver today. 

Based on the following data:

There are 8 million people in Canada today.
Portuguese is spoken by around 5 million people in Europe.
German is spoken by around 8 million people in Europe.
Mandarin is spoken by around 20 million people in Asia.
Spanish is spoken by around 20 million people in Europe.
Italian is spoken by around 20 million people in Asia.
Korean is spoken by around 20 million people in Asia.

It is therefore likely that in Vancouver today there are only a few people who speak Italian or Korean.


Based on the data provided, it is likely that only a few people speak Italian or Korean in Vancouver today. In general, European languages are spoken in Vancouver today whereas Asian languages are not.


Portuguese, German, Mandarin, Spanish and Italian are all European languages. Korean is not a European language.

Vancouver, the largest city in British Columbia is best known for its lush natural scenery, many world famous mountains that dominate the city skyline including both the Mt Baker and North Shore mountains, and the ocean in the west. The British Columbian government has encouraged thousands of people from all over the world to move to the city with the promise of year round warm weather along with the economic opportunity the city represents.

While living in Vancouver one might hear the following languages spoken. Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Russian. Residents have also adopted colloquial phrases like ""You're welcome"" to express gratitude. While it would be very difficult for the average human listener to discern which languages are spoken, one can deduce that most of the languages spoken in Vancouver are not English. 

In conclusion many people are speaking languages other than English in Vancouver which can be characterized as Level 53 Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.

Many of the languages spoken in Vancouver are unique to Canada's most populous province, as well as to the world. Some of them are endangered, others in very limited use.


In 2023, the number of foreign residents in Vancouver reached 1,320,000. Approximately 90% of the residents are of non-Canadian descent and speak a language other than English. 

A few hundred thousand Canadian residents live in Vancouver as well, however, 95% of the population consists of native English speakers. The number of English speakers in Vancouver is rapidly declining.


Many residents of Vancouver have chosen to speak the languages of non-Canadian residents because they are much more comfortable in the local tongue. Most often this is Spanish or Chinese, but there are others like Hindi, Arabic and Punjabi.


The city of Vancouver promotes itself as a multicultural melting pot, where residents of different nationalities and ethnic backgrounds live side by side and develop close friendships. In reality, however, many residents of Vancouver are less accepting and often avoid the presence of outsiders in public places.


In most cases, the non-Canadian residents in Vancouver are immigrants to Canada who were invited here by employers. Immigrants tend to be poorer than Canadian residents, who typically have a higher level of education. They often lack the resources to learn another language or develop public speaking skills.


Many British Columbian residents are not so welcoming to immigrant friends and neighbours, and"
" I mean it’s a medium where you perform the music so why not use it as the vehicle for telling a story. The music tells the story and the story is what you’re in the opera house to deliver. I’ve been lucky enough to witness three extraordinary operas this year in the space of just a couple of weeks. One was Mozart’s “Le nozze di Figaro” a tale of misguided greed and deception set in the 19th century. I was thrilled to work on this production as much of our music was by Don Banks and this was our first attempt to commission new music for the production and a real baptism of fire for the entire team. The second opera was “Il Barbiere di Siviglia” also a libretto by Mozart, which I worked on last year. This production also had a great deal of music by our colleague Don Banks, but unlike “Le nozze di Figaro” and the last time I saw him write music this was a “home-run”! And then there was Rossini’s “Macbeth” which my employer, Coventry Opera, are mounting with a libretto by Stephen Daldry. I’ve never heard of Rossini before but this is a particularly intriguing story to tell onstage and in the music, and Daldry’s book is a particularly interesting one to tell with music. So I’m now firmly in my old position"," After all, opera is an artform that needs to excite the senses and the heart. It needs to pull us into a world and an experience, an escape from the mundane. That’s where the theatre comes in – it makes opera come alive. I worked my way up to my current job of Chief Operations Officer of the Opera house. From there my primary role is to build and grow the business for the opera house. As the COO I oversee the various departments of the organisation – Marketing, Finance, Human Resources, Sales and Marketing and Operations – making sure that we deliver on the mission to grow the business, to grow the company, to become the number one opera house in the nation. The theatre becomes even more vital as our company continues to grow and as we develop our business nationally and internationally. We are investing in new productions to ensure that the opera house delivers the world-class events that our audience expects. We are constantly innovating and exploring different production types and formats. We don’t want to rest on our laurels though, so we continue to build out our rehearsal space to include recording facilities. It is vital that we create the best and most enjoyable working environment for our people. The Opera house operates a number of theatres across the country, in addition to our main house in Auckland, Auckland Opera House. I am lucky enough to work in the Auckland main house where our season includes a number of exciting productions that will be premiered in the new year"," And the live music is amazing, but the real magic happens when all the music comes together with the great acting that we get to see on stage, that comes alive. It’s a team sport. Opera is a team sport!  Now some people would say “Well but what about rock, blues, jazz, electronic music?”. I say  “What about them” they respond. I say “If it has music in it they are not Opera” They are not opera!  These genres exist because there is money in them, and money exists for a reason. They exist to make money. Who gives a toss if a few people in the audience like a particular singer? Opera is first and foremost about the art of music-making. The art of bringing the music and the acting together.  The opera that was sung at school assembly twenty years ago might no longer be possible to stage today. New technologies, new demands, a constantly evolving audience now expect different things of an opera house. They are looking for the experience, they want to be taken on a journey. And opera houses need to find new ways to monetize their audience.   Let’s call a spade a spade. You can call me old fashion if you like. I prefer to think of it as being an old fashioned spade.  When you look at opera houses you often see the classical set of pillars against the classical stage with an orchestra pit downstage left and stalls upstage right."," We cannot fully understand Wagner’s Ring cycle or Bizet’s Carmen without music. Likewise, we cannot experience Shakespeare’s language, comedy, tragedy or history of theatre without music. Music and music alone has become the main driver for my love of opera and all the arts for that matter. I see opera not merely as an art form but as the best teacher a child can have. Music has always been at the heart of my being. I remember singing in the womb and for years afterwards. I was a musical prodigy, studying classical violin at 9 and operatic soprano at 10. My parents split when I was young. I’d get up early to practise – violin, cello, voice, all at the same time. My father never complained. I was the prodigy of the family. I went to Juilliard and spent seven happy years there, studying with some of the best musicians in the world. My first love is classical music and today’s opera is at its most entertaining and expressive. I love Wagner, Verdi, Puccini, Bizet, Strauss, Wagner again and contemporary composers from around the world. Opera is no longer just for the older generation. Opera is cool. Opera is relevant. Opera is the 21st century’s most exciting art form. It needs to be championed. Opera is a must for everyone’s cultural repertoire. Opera is the future. Opera is in fact. And here"," The music sets the scene, builds the characters and colours the emotions. I also learned that opera is not only for the well-heeled. Indeed in many parts of the world you can catch an opera for as little as $5 in the stalls at a local church or high school. And you can be there for quite a performance too. Opera can be an entertaining, uplifting and thought-provoking experience for anyone of any age. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

The opera of their lives – An evening at the opera

I first fell in love with opera when I was five years old. My parents took me to the Metropolitan opera. I have vivid memories of the giant screen of images and the wonderful music being projected onto the huge stage. It transported me into a world of beautiful fantasy where I seemed to be the only person in the entire auditorium. It was an unforgettable experience. When I was seven I had my first-ever ballet. And for the next seven years, ballet and opera were the only forms of entertainment I was allowed to see. Ballet was a bit disappointing as a spectator, as I could barely take in more than a few dozen steps before I tripped over my train-trackted toes. My father took me to the opera again when I was nine. I still remember the excitement of being taken to our local opera house for the first time. I could clearly see all the characters on the big"," Opera is a fully fledged art form. But since I joined the opera I have had to realise that, contrary to popular belief, theatre isn’t what sets opera apart. Theatre sets it apart. Theatre is an art form of its own. Opera’s mission has been and is to present the greatest amount of beautiful music in the cleanest, most professional and beautiful way. And so it seems the very definition of the arts (at least for me) is being challenged. Opera has the best music, so why put on a show? Why not present it as a concert of music? And why the fuck would I want to go to opera, when I can go to the National Theatre and hear amazing music too? Not to mention the hundreds of other arts present in our city – such as ballet, theatre, classical and jazz music clubs, as well as several cinemas and an art gallery, not to mention the great artisanal beer that has recently become a part of our cultural landscape! Well here’s my opinion – and I know this is probably not a popular one in our city – I think opera is a fantastic art form that has been sorely let down by the lack of a proper theatrical element. I think opera was born to bring live actors on stage, and the sheer beauty of the opera sound track should be enough on it’s own to transport you to an imaginary world of gods and monsters, princes and kings. So I for one am very excited to"," Opera is an art form to be cherished and treated with respect. Opera, with all its complexities, requires the perfect voice, the perfect set of body features, perfect timing and skill to pull off each night. It demands a level of commitment and dedication that is rarely, if ever, found in other forms of artistic expression. With this in mind, let us consider a typical opera performance. As we gaze out into the auditorium, we see an audience of many shapes and sizes. Some are standing, some are seated, and many are dancing and moving. Our eyes lock onto the stage where a team of dancers prepare and execute a choreography that is designed to tell a story, to convey emotion and, importantly, to entertain. The dancers are moving to a score, they are not just moving, they are giving voice to their emotions, often crying on occasion. The orchestra plays a carefully orchestrated sequence of notes that give the story weight and bring it to life. We take our seats, and within minutes the theatre is full. What has occurred on stage thus far has taken no longer than two hours. Yet at the same time, it has taken place in our minds for several hours. We have not merely consumed an entertainingly told story, we have been emotionally taken on a journey. We leave the theatre feeling satisfied, perhaps even challenged. Opera gives us a unique experience, combining artistry, complexity, emotion and entertainment. Opera is theatrical, but only secondarily so. Oper"
" Yet broadcasting today is in trouble of being'mainStreamed' and narrowed into a narrowcasting channel. The metaphor of sowing has become difficult as the ground is already fertile and full of broadcasters who are over crowding the fields. The metaphor of reaping is also problematic as there is a tendency to ignore or minimize those who fall short of the mark. So what is a broadcast channel to look like in the future? Does it have to narrow its lens? Might it even broaden it to include the many small channels that form a wider collective field?

A:

In a similar context a few years back, the broadcaster ITV was suffering from ""monocultureitis"" - a phrase coined by Alan Turing at Bletchley Park to describe the phenomenon of a single computer program following a fixed, predetermined algorithm which no longer produced unpredictable results. 
While the effects of monocultureitis are difficult to detect by visual inspection (for example, look at most cars and the colours they come in) it becomes obvious when you see the results of following a single strategy; when you see the output of a single algorithm. The question that then arises is: if one can see the results of a single strategy, what is the value of having a strategy in the first place. 
I suspect that, in the case of ""broadcasting"" monocultureitis may have arrived at a stage where it is no longer profitable to broadcast. The question"," To this end a number of seeds are sown to encourage future growth. In broadcasting it is believed that we should plan the use of technology to broaden our understanding of society.

Technology is used to create podcasts in which three people share their lives with others. The podcast was created to improve awareness of depression and encourage people to seek professional help. The use of technology allows the sharing of stories that would never be shared in a traditional medium.

Podcasting has been shown to help others who suffer from depression, and those who do not seek help due to stigma. Podcasting has become more popular and mainstream as a result of depression awareness. The podcast will help reduce the stigma associated with seeking help from depression and encourage people to seek professional help.

The story begins in a small farming community in Australia known locally as the Riverina where one of the farmers who is a newcomer to farming asks another local if they have heard of a 'Broadcasting'. The other farmer does not recall such a concept but a quick internet search reveals the concept of early radio and broadcasting in Australia and across Europe. The other farmer says 'yes' and goes on to explain that the term 'Broadcasting' has been bandied about to describe the new technology where groups of people post information, videos, images and commentary on social media platforms. The first local tells the newcomer that while he had not heard the term he is sure the concept has existed in Europe for many years, but now technology had made it possible for this concept to be realised across the broadest possible audience.  

At the beginning of the story the farmers have not noticed any change in the local farmers and the general population of the Riverina having not heard of the concept of 'Broadcasting'.  

After a short search of the internet the first local returns with an article which tells of a similar concept to that of 'Broadcasting' that had existed in Europe for many years but only recently had technology made this concept possible across the broad"," The metaphor was first used by Paul Scarfe in his book Thoughts in an Oyster-Shell (1896) and again in his poem 'Broadcasting' published in the same year. In the second half of the 20th century the term was used to describe methods of mass communication, notably radio and television. As a metaphor it has continued to find favour in the 21st century. 

In the 21st century 'broadcasting' is used to mean the way we use technology to get information to a large number of people rapidly in different ways. Broadcast is also used in an older sense to refer to the act of sowing seeds in the ground by hand.

It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles"," It is true of any agricultural venture, but to this extent more so of seeding. 

The seeds need careful tending though and so the first pioneers of broadcasting used animalPower to move their aerials and then light and transmit the seeds across the landscape. This was called aerial planting and also known as 'wireless'. Over the years technology has improved and so people could operate the aerials using petrol-powered generators and so aerial planting became known as 'broadcasting by wire'. 

Broadcasting is social shaping and also has an element of modern optimism in that it can be planned for to ensure a rich harvest. It can be described as agrarian metaphors of planning for growth.

was a form of media that was popularised by the Beatles and other British bands. It was a live music form where the performer would sing, play guitar and generally entertain the audience.

The metaphor of broadcasting is still used to mean transmission or transfer of information over a distance. This information can be verbal or non-verbal and is commonly available for others to access. Broadcasting can also mean to guide the behaviour of others towards a course of action. The metaphor can still be found in the phrase to 'broadcast your feelings'. This is done to allow others to tune into your personal emotional state. 

Broadcasting originally meant sowing seeds by hand. It is therefore a metaphor of agriculture to be able to sow seed by hand without using any machines, machines that are in themselves not completely new are hand tools that can be used in this way, one that has blades which cut thin slices of material similar to a rotavap. 

As an agricultural metaphor it is about planned growth and therefore about sowing seeds that will later show an ability to grow. In the modernist sense of optimism about the possibility of a rich harvest it implies that in all probability no seed will not grow. This is exactly what was done with broadcasting, ideas that first came to the inventor of radio had to be sown many times until the broadcasting of these ideas was effective enough for people to pay for the invention of the radio. Another example of this is the invention of the internet and mobile phones. They all required multiple sowing or broadcasting to be effective. 

The original meaning of broadcasting is however not so optimistic. It is about the passing on of information, as this"
" While it might be possible for a reviewer to spend many years crafting their own individual reviews for books they have not previously reviewed, many are so eager to promote a book’s ‘release date’ that they will rush through their composition, sending the review to a press before they have had time to finish reading or reflecting on what they have written. Reviewing books does not need to be done quickly: time spent reading and considering a book’s merits can be the most rewarding. Kermode believes that this haste to present a review for a book, even when the reviewers are experts, reduces their critical faculties: instead of critically assessing the book and allowing its virtues to shine through, reviewers will tend to select the things in a book that will most appeal to their preconceptions; hence reviews often tell only a part of the story, and are often shallow and inaccurate. In order to write a review that will stay in people’s minds after they have closed the book, Kermode argues, it is necessary to take the time to write a detailed account of the book’s themes, motifs and symbols, and to allow this account to resonate within your readers. Kermode believes that by spending a little time reading a book and contemplating its merits we can provide the most rewarding reading experience, and this is the reason why he encourages reviewers to read what they are reviewing, to take the time to consider the arguments and inferences made within it. This will mean that when they"," Anticipated demand for a work is usually insufficient to generate the resources needed to undertake the work. The resulting reviews are, as Frank Kermode puts it, “brief affairs”. Review-writing is an art form best performed by practitioners; indeed, reviews are usually produced by a single individual working at a highly motivated pace. The constraints of time and resources require that reviewers approach their work with an appropriate mix of care and impetuosity. The most successful reviews, Frank Kermode suggests, manage to blend personal and professional elements; they show an enthusiasm for their subject and for the people involved in that subject’s production, they acknowledge their subject’s importance to society, but at the same time they discuss it with clarity and concision. As he suggests, “the critic should not exceed the bounds of his competence, but neither should he lack imagination” and this approach to review-writing is what ultimately leads to the craft’s success or failure.

A Review is a short essay meant to evaluate a piece of art or literature.

-What you didn't like about the work. This could be a"," They are usually written and circulated quickly to satisfy demand for a particular book or film or to reinforce a particular experience.

There are numerous pitfalls for a reviewer who hopes to make his or her work known to a wide readership. These include:
 Not sufficiently contextualising or explaining one’s own point of view, even if one is well-informed. The best reviews are not only written in the first person but also exhibit an insider’s knowledge of the topics they cover, which makes them particularly relevant to those who are already interested in the fields they write about. 
 Omitting basic editorial or grammatical flaws. There is a distinction to be made between grammatical errors (which can often be pointed out by a non-native speaker) and mistakes of interpretation or application. 
 Writing with a rather self-satisfied, “I told you so”, tone. This is something that can only be avoided if the reviewer is writing as part of an academic team whose findings were published or presented at a major conference. 
 Not providing sufficient analysis of one’s own reading of the original text. This is particularly important for movies or books that one hasn’t read closely before (where one needs to “unpack” the author’s intentions). 
 Avoiding or hiding the most important part of a review: one’s opinion. 

Despite these pitfalls there are many ways that good reviews do reach a wider audience. Some of the most successful British and American film"," They are read by friends and relatives; they are purchased as reference material; and, they are saved to a library’s website for quick and easy access.

Frank Kermode’s account of writing reviews for a living takes a critical stance, contrasting the labour of love of ‘good’ reviews with the utilitarianism of the commercial reviews often recommended by the publishers.  In his chapter on Craft he notes that ‘practitioners’ often find the process distasteful or even impossible’[2] and suggests that ‘those who would write well should write well regardless of the situation in which they find themselves’. He also suggests that the more we consider the reviews as ‘self-presentation’ of the author; as ‘publicity’ for the author; and as ‘instruction in writing’, the better we will understand the review-writing craft.

Frank Kermode provides an insightful account of the review-writing craft as practiced by a journalist who was also a professional writer. His account is also relevant to the review-writing craft as practised by professional writers in the 21st century who may also have little experience of being an author or being a professional journalist.

The reviewer’s objective is to get the product reviewed in the best possible light, and to do this they need to find the most flattering way of representing it; the reviewer must find a way of making the thing they are reviewing look good. This is why reviews are so often written with the intention of being ‘bitten’ by the market: published too late, on the wrong platform, and too impolitic, for example.

In all cases, their main purpose is to be of interest to someone for a few minutes and to provide an insight into the work of a particular artist. A review is a tool. Like all tools it has a function, a narrow and specific use to which it can be put. Reviews can be useful when there is no other source of information. They can be particularly useful when the information they contain is specific, localised and interesting; or when they make connections between different periods or across different disciplines; or when they add something to our understanding of the artist or their world through their characterisation of their work, the way they present it or through their analysis. Inevitably, they are also capable of providing general information, the kind which is accessible to anyone who wants it. Inevitably, as a consequence, they are often dull, over-long and full of dead, passive verbiage. The review-writer must recognise their limitations and be able to work within them. 

Reviews can be written by the individual who bought the work, by the art critic for a particular publication, or by the trained academic writing a review of an exhibition of artworks.

The reviewer should use the following considerations when writing a review:
1.	Explicit/Concrete, Analytical/Abstract

" This time around it was the ABC network that aired the restored version. 

Why do you think it had such a powerful impact on the American public?


I think it had an impact because Citizen Kane was able to show that a great film can be made by a mediocre director (Orson Welles) and a studio eager to make money despite the cost (Majestic) without compromising artistic standards (or at least less than the original print).  It also showed that the public was willing to pay money for cinema experience and that movies could also provide insight into society.  Finally, the film provided a rare opportunity to see a well crafted character study as well as a provocative, yet logical dissection of capitalism and greed.


How did the public react?  Was the film a commercial success?


The film was not a commercial success, which likely impacted its distribution and awareness.  The critics praised the film but it was not a critical or box office smash.  Despite this the public was very passionate about the film.  The obsession with the box office receipts is one that is followed closely by movie fans today.  A film’s return on investment (ROI) is a highly sought after metric for studios to track.  Achieving good ROI can attract a studio to spend more on publicity and marketing campaigns, in this case the studio, RKO, agreed to make an additional print of the film for distribution and to cover the cost of making new"," And not just television, but the small screen. A young me saw it at the cinema when I was a child. My dad bought the ticket in my name to support his favourite cinema. While he was at the cinema, my mum left me with a small box of Milk Duds (my favourite snack) and the video game Frogger. I was entranced. I watched the whole movie from beginning to end, despite having to go to sleep in the middle. My Mum noticed my odd behaviour and eventually she asked me what was wrong. When I told her, she laughed and said she had made me watch that because I loved Frogger so much. She was right. I did love the movie, but not for the money, for the story, and for the message that it conveyed about the limits of power and the dangers of absolute control. I love the movie still, and have watched it countless times since. It has stayed with me, and I hope it will stay with many generations to come.

The movie Citizen Kane was based on the Life of Count Otto Rensch, which itself was based on the life of the notorious industrialist William R. Hearst.
Hearst is known to have funded the movie, which is why the brouhaha over its release delayed it. 
But once it was released, it became a surprise hit for several reasons. 
For one, people at the time were extremely isolated from"," 

What exactly is ‘Citizen Kane?’  It is a film from 1941 starring Orson Welles and an adaptation of a newspaper play. Its subject matter is shrouded in mystery – it is rumoured to contain references to a billionaire’s deathbed confession of all of his assets to a medium, whose name is also lost to history.  The film was controversial from the outset due to its use of innovative techniques such as pre-sound, film-out, synchronized sound, cut-in and multiple exposures to create a number of striking scenes. There were also rumours of its content including drug use and adult themes, however despite this Orson Welles was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for his work on the film. 

There is no doubt that Citizen Kane is a striking film. There are still debates about what it depicts and whether the ‘mystery’ of the film’s subject matter actually adds to the mystery and enjoyment of viewing the film – is it a simple metaphor for greed or is it a hidden conspiracy and one that will rock the foundations of world finance? It remains a work of art.


It seems likely to me that this film will be remembered for its striking visuals rather than its specific narrative content.   On the one hand, this is disappointing; on the other hand, I am delighted that our society has the means to engage with the arts in this way.  

Perhaps what is meant by ‘Citizen Kane"," In fact, the TV series of the film was so popular it was spun off into a TV series of its own. Not coincidentally, this was the same time that viewers were demanding more sophisticated television programming and a larger range of movies in their programming. 

Some film critics have found the film’s themes of avarice and the pursuit of power and wealth disturbing and the lengths to which its main protagonist, Conradkopf, will go to protect his empire repellent but most have found it a powerful indictment of the dangers of wealth and power while the richness of its cinematography and musical scores enhance rather than detract from the film’s appeal. It is one of the best films ever made, and still has a loyal cult following to this day.

It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. In fact, the TV series of the"," But why did it take so long for the film to be released? And why wasn’t it an instant success? Its subject, Mr. Aaron Sisko, was in fact a real person who led a rather dramatic life, being born in Iowa to a Swedish mother and an American father. Mr. Sisko lived in California (it was Hearst’s newspaper empire that built him a home in Iowa). He started his film career in the silent cinema before transitioning into sound films. But Citizen Kane’s release was delayed because one of the producers allegedly didn’t like it and demanded to be replaced. There was another reason for its delay, the changing cinema technology, which made it more difficult to show the black and white shots in color, but that wasn’t a major factor.

The film starts with the arrival in America of Mr. Sisko and his family. He has a very demanding job and lives an isolated life. His isolation is probably the main reason it took so long until the film was released, as one of the assistants to him felt a film with Mr. Sisko in the lead role could draw attention away from the news of Hearst and profit the latter from negative publicity. The newsman lives a lavish life and owns the largest home and several other pieces of property. He is also incredibly influential. He is married to an American he met in Europe and has several children with his Swedish wife. Mr. Sisko"," The film, made by Orson Welles for an estimated $400,000, is a thinly veiled exposé of the New York media and business world of the early 1900s, a time when Hearst owned the major newspapers in New York. The film won its Oscar for Cinematography. A huge critical success, it is considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. But it was not a box office success. Today it has a reputation as one of the greatest films ever made but it was a flop at the box office. Why? Its three hours and 39 minutes make it quite a film. But today we refer to films of over 2 hours as films to avoid confusion about the medium. For the time Citizen Kane was made it was considered an exceptional length. A TV director might have balked at its length but to a film director it was considered reasonable. And, with its theme and style Welles managed to maintain a sense of the narrative throughout the film. The structure is a combination of flashbacks and present day telling the story of Kane in a sequence of three parts. Although Citizen Kane was nominated for 5 Oscars, only 1 was a win for cinematography. The film did however win 7 BAFTAS, more than any other film, and a total of 34 nominations. Although it was a critical and commercial success it was not a box office success. 

Here is what the prompt might look like using the example sentence from"," It has often been pointed out that it was the television that made or broke the film. While the film is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time (it was nominated for 7 Academy Awards and won 3), it could not have made it into the pantheon of great films without the medium’s assistance. For instance, it was Kane’s habit of spending huge sums on his movies but only ever letting the public see the results of the spending later, which created a huge build up of expectation among his audience and gave viewers something to talk about. This was helped by the film’s release during the Great Depression and it’s depiction of New York life in the roaring 20’s - both of which made the film all the more relatable to its time and place. Despite this, it still performed disappointingly at the box office. And while a number of its plot points were repeated in other films such as Orson Welles’s The Shadow over Innocence and in a made-for-TV movie of the same name, Kane still has many admirers. It is still regularly shown on US network television and often attracts big-name star performances from its time. Its themes of class, wealth and power, even when exaggerated, have endured and can be seen in current events.

"  The English Breakfast – a drink described by Churchill as ‘tea with a kick’ – remains in vogue but the importance of the morning meal has never been in doubt.  

As a result breakfast cereal has arrived in England following the development of modern industrialised agriculture in the 19th century where wheat could be efficiently grown globally.  New ingredients such as cereals, milk and sugar allowed for the invention of a wide variety of breakfast cereals and the rise of the breakfast cereal bar.  

The modernisation of agriculture and the growing of wheat meant that the English began their breakfast revolution.  However, despite the arrival of breakfast cereals and the breakfast cereal bar, the English never abandoned their tea drinking habits, which continued to be referred to as their ‘morning meal’.

The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute.  Breakfast is proven to be essential for the body to function at its best in order to ward off the many illnesses that beset mankind.   While the importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute the rise of the breakfast cereal is a relatively recent development in England’s breakfast revolution.  However, with the wide variety of breakfast cereals available the English breakfast is guaranteed.

It is no surprise then that today’s children have breakfast at an early age with young people today reporting that morning coffee is as important to their morning routine as breakfast. The history of breakfast and the food that goes into it can be seen in various forms throughout history with some historians suggesting that in the beginning there was porridge which is why we refer to the process of eating breakfast as “going on a porridge” when asked about it.  Breakfast has undergone multiple changes throughout history.  In the late 1800’s Americans would eat hardtack or dry toast which in turn was a precursor to the current morning “egg and cheese” sandwich which was invented in 1937 in a New Jersey factory.  In the UK a breakfast might consist of cereal, fruit or cereal and fruit with many people opting for home made cereals such as porridge and oatcakes.  In recent years the proliferation of fast food and in particular the emergence of Subway as a market leader has had an impact on the traditional British breakfast of sausage, egg and grilled tomato.

However the daily routine for an English person from the 17th century onwards was still closely entwined with the morning meal as it provided the bulk of the essentials for survival such as protein, energy and sugar in order to get the body working through the day.   This meant that the meal was seen as the primary focus for a long morning with little time for other activities such as writing.   As a result the description of a good breakfast soon emerged as one that could not just be filling and nutritious but also be enjoyable  to partake of with friends or family. 

In particular the rising of the sun and how to best prepare one’s breakfast was celebrated with gusto with many descriptions using songs and poems.   One of the most famous describing the best breakfast was a poem by William Barnes from 1640 who went on to also describe the worst breakfast. 

“It’s the worst breakfast in the whole wide world/ When you eat too much sugar and too little meat./ You have breakfast like a bird and supper like a goat/ The way that you start your day is a disgrace to all hos./”


These and many similar descriptions of the best breakfasts soon became a national pastime with each region in England having their own variations on this theme.   A man in Essex for instance considered his breakfast to consist of two eggs, a quarter of a lb of back bacon, some well done rump steak, a small pot"," It wasn’t until much later in the 14th century that the first references to a breakfast service were made. By the 15th century an English breakfast was a standard meal consisting of porridge, followed by eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, bacon again and sausages as well as toast and milk. As the story goes this was brought to England by theFlemish but it was the Dutch who were the first to establish the custom of having a breakfast “tipple” with a glass of alcohol being served with the meal. 

This is a fun and engaging story which demonstrates how innovation and food taste change over time. The story also contains some interesting facts about breakfast. I liked the use of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level to measure readability and was able to relate the grade level to the difficulty of the reading questions.

The proliferation of breakfast chains such as Sainsburys and Starbucks have ensured that the traditional British breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausages, mushrooms and toast is more readily available than ever before and is fast becoming an expectation rather than an indulgence for many. According to Michael Moss in his book ‘The Power of Movement’; “No British writer of the 19th century could have foreseen the world and life we live today, and especially what the breakfast revolution has brought about. “The story of breakfast in England traces a direct line from the medieval banquet to the global cafe, through World War II to the modern day, a transformation that’s seen a return to a “proper” breakfast – eggs, bacon, sausages, mushrooms and toast – rise from the brink of oblivion. It’s a revolution that has seen a new generation of people coming of age at the end of the 20th century. Some would say breakfast has always been the “meal of choice” for modern humans; but in England at least, and perhaps elsewhere too, it’s become something more. “Moss goes on to say that the “glory days of breakfast” were a “hippy hangover” but that “the modernisation of breakfast…has taken place over the last 40 years, creating something that most of the public now view as basic necessity.”

In the UK breakfast is now part of the daily routine for many, eaten either at home or on the go, and now more than ever it is a necessity for those staying active.   
  
“Breakfast”, wrote William Cobbett, a 19th century UK journalist and political cartoonist, “is the most important meal of the day. It may not be the most plentiful, but neither is it the poorest, nor is it the least comfortable or savoury.” 

In the last few years the eating of breakfast has become popular with many Britons seeking to begin their day on an energetic note. The media has played its part with television presenters promoting the importance of having a “startiful” or “savoury” breakfast and even the government has backed the idea of “getting up, eating breakfast and getting on with life.”  

While breakfast may be a relatively recent arrival in England, it has a rich history. A medieval English breakfast consisted of a “pancake” (or “pane” in modern English), “buttered”, “and sauced” with “rye and milk”. The “breakfast” meal was often the highlight of the day for families who may not have had time to prepare a full meal but still enjoyed a warm meal together to ward off the chill of the morning. 

It is clear that there is a strong contemporary demand for an “England’s breakfast revolution” and while","

This historical change is usually attributed to the influence of continental Europe with a shift to breakfast as the central meal of the day. While continental Europe had breakfast already established in the Middle Ages the main meal of the day (dinner) was still lunch. In England during the 17th and 18th centuries breakfast became associated with better nutrition and the rising consumption of this meal was to have a considerable influence on national diet and the growth of a breakfast industry. 

The importance of breakfast was given further importance by studies on obesity amongst children. These studies revealed that the prevalence of obesity amongst 8-11 year olds was double that amongst 12-15 year olds. While it was believed that the children’s diets were adequate in relation to the food groups that obesity related to these studies recommended the need for breakfast to be included in the national agenda. 

Breakfast became so important to children’s diets that by the 1980’s breakfast cereal companies began to sponsor breakfast shows on television encouraging young children to eat their breakfast. 

During the 20th century breakfast became so significant that it was made an entry in to the European Charter for Public Health which included the importance of breakfast, education regarding the benefits of breakfast and the need for breakfast consumption to be promoted. 

England’s breakfast revolution  

The breakfast revolution is a phrase used by the UK health authority to characterise the change to breakfast as the most important meal of the day in England.
