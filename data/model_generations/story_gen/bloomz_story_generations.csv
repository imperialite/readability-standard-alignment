A2, Buildings are very strong and last a long time. Some of our buildings can last forever. Many of the people building buildings are old. They've worked in the building for many years., A blue sky above a blue river surrounded by beautiful green grass. People play football in the stadium. People dance at a music concert. Building a building takes a lot of work. People can't just put things together.," This is the beginning of building construction. Builders and laborers build the building. They are the workers on a building. When the building is completed, an inspector from the town council comes and inspects the building. If there is any fault it is fixed. If the building looks good an official comes to take a photo. If there is a new building the town council agrees to fund it.", A builder builds the building by cutting out shapes that look like the outlines of the drawings the architect draws. He or she doesn't worry too much about the shape because he or she doesn't need to know too much about the details of the drawing. A plasterer lays plaster between the blocks of the building. He or she doesn't need to think about anything that the architect doesn't tell him or her and all he or she needs to do is to follow what the architect tells him or her. A stonemason carves the building with a sharp knife. He or she doesn't need to think about what the architect didn't tell him or her. He or she just has to follow what the architect told him or her. The architect is a person that is good at drawing pictures. They make a lot of pictures to show people their ideas. They use them to make buildings.," There are also builders and masons, and men and women who work for building materials like sand, stones and bricks. Some people live in the buildings. When it rains, they are in the floor because the roof is high enough. People watch the sky from the roof."," Then the builder starts work building the building. People use the building to do the things that the architect has decided. The building has people inside who live in it. People also work on a building. It has people inside it. People often ask, ""Who are you?"" Question 1: How do people keep warm and dry? Buildings."," The builder builds the building. They start to build a city and they also build villages. People come to cities to look for something to do. A building is made of lots of things. When a building is made, they are put on a truck and delivered to the town, village, or village to village."
A2, No. 'Thanks for meeting' he said. No. No. The door slammed into him and his arm went round the neck of Paul who looked like he was about to choke him and the door closed. Paul screamed.," Paul then said, 'I promise that I will make my best efforts.' Paul didn't let go of that and did what he could. The people in Dante's Peak stayed and they bought their businesses. When Harry was telling Paul about the trouble of the town, he said, 'Look at that shop over there. I will help it with more money.' Paul said he would do whatever Paul could. Harry laughed and said, 'OK.' Paul made a new best friend."," 'I won't go. My job is in the volcano and I won't go just to be your best man. '
Harry refused to go to the town meeting for Paul's birthday party. Paul was annoyed."," 'But you will learn something if I go. It will help me.' 'Who are they' asked Paul. No one he replied. Just the locals. Paul thought it was a village in his region and he wanted to be their friend. Harry looked around. Not a village. It was a mountain that was half a day walk to the village. He thought it would be a good idea to visit the village. Paul was right. He knew that they would have their shops and businesses. This was a problem for Harry, but he knew there was a problem with money. After he went there, he asked for money because he wanted his clothes to be clean and the food they ate was good. After all, who else could make them smell the flowers? When he was there he found the local woman sitting with a child. She brought him to the village. All the locals were standing around the fire making food for the woman and her child. They were laughing and talking. The local woman was making chicken, bread, sweets, sweets and more sweets. Harry was very impressed by the food and how it smelt. He got back up and started to walk back to his room. When he got to the village he heard a baby crying. He ran over and found the girl with the crying baby. The baby's parents were on the other side of the fire. They didn't see him and didn't hear him. Harry ran over to them and looked at the baby crying, but he couldn't see any of the baby's parents. He asked if anyone was hungry. The little boy was born. Harry was shocked. He was a lucky man. He was a lucky man. He was a lucky man.", Paul said with an expression on his face 'you are the one. Who can help me?' 'You're right' Harry said with a smile., He knew what he had to do. 'I don't think you understand me very well. I have a plan. And this town will know when it is over.' 'Yes' said Paul. 'But how you gonna do that?' 'Because when we leave the town will go.' Harry nodded., No one said anything else. Afterwards Paul said: 'I was right! The people here in Dante's Peak will stay. They have shops and businesses and no one is thinking about volcanoes but only about money. '
A2," It was that way. Not so in present times. 'Well what?' Einon wondered. 'What do you think?' asked his knight. 'Oh I really think that the knights should be ashamed,' said Bowen sternly. 'But sir you know Einon, you were born a commoner and you are still a commoner,' said Einon. 'But I am still a knight,' he repeated with pride."," So they always fought with their hearts. Einon laughed and said, ""Well, I think that you are not such a bad guy, sir Bowen! Just forget the code and fight with your head!"""," The code was a way to keep the peace in the land. It's a beautiful, old code. 'I have a wonderful code, too, Mr. Bowen,' Einon replied. He tried to talk to Bowen but his words fell on deaf ears because he had learned the Old Code well. 'I always try to keep the peace', Einon replied. 'I would like to fight with Bowen, but I can't right now, because I've already been chosen for another battle'. Einon looked at Bowen in the eyes but he didn't hear. 'Beware the arrow, Bowen' cried Einon."," But because of the New Code all knights and knights men were enemies of all their enemies. Now the king has made an alliance with the New Code. All knights men are enemies of all their enemies! Oh my boy! Einon felt sad because his head was in danger. 'Let me go home!' Einon told his uncle Bowen. The uncle said, you can stay here! But Einon got home and sat under the tree. But the knight knew how to use his head. Einon was afraid the knight would fall from his horse. A lot of knights were riding horses. The knight looked up and saw the knight coming out of the tree. He yelled 'Beautiful Knight!' But the knight thought of the Old Code. He jumped down from the tree. The knight thought of the Old Code. He jumped down from the tree. The knight fell from his horse. But the knight never died! When it was very very cold Einon took his coat from the tree. But the knight couldn't hear him. So the knight walked to the house. And Einon thought of the Old Code. He took the coat. He turned up the chimney. And the Knight of the Old Code came. Einon couldn't hear him. 'What are you doing here?' The knight smiled at Einon. He kissed Einon.", There was no time when kings would punish anybody. There was no time when knights would look after their followers. There were no lords or dukes in the world. There was no money. There was no power. There was no fame. There was no money! No knights. No princes. No kings. No dukes. No lords. No...," They lived a peaceful life. But then came this... the Renaissance. In the Renaissance people didn't pay respect to the knights anymore, because they wanted to be treated like kings."," But nowadays they don't trust each other. 'Why?' asked Einon as he put his helmet on. 'I hope not,' he sighed."
A2," They started building houses to live in. What they did next? Build roads to get from village to village, from town to town, and from the countryside to the city. People were moving in and out of villages all day and night.", They started growing food in big fields. The result of that was that food became easier and cheaper to find because they no longer had to hunt. The world started to grow in size.," They learned how to grow plants. The first farming began about 2000 years ago. Most farmers use seeds or plants from the fields and they do not farm in their homes. What type of farming is used today is organic farming, but for many years, organic farming has not been widely used in the US. US organic farming: organic farmers grow their crops using natural methods, without using the use of chemicals, animal hormones or fertilizers in their field, or raising livestock that have been raised without animal hormones or synthetic fertilizers. US organic farmers are organic consumers, and support the growing principles of organic farming. The US organic industry is worth more than $700 billion a year. US agriculture is the largest economic and employment sector of the United States, employing almost 7.5 million. It employs nearly 60% of all Americans, and contributes almost 30% of GDP."," To feed themselves they grew food in gardens. They also made pottery and other items using plants. They had a family life. Farming was their main lifestyle. They had lots of fun. They often made their own music and danced. Today these farmers work in farms, growing crops. They are responsible for most food. Today they are farming for profit. They make good money by growing food."," They used plants for food as well as clothing, animal feed and medicine. People were very busy because the need to provide for their families was very high."," In the beginning, people used small stones for farming and then started using tools to help them work. This was probably the first major change in agriculture. People used the soil to grow the crops they planted. People were first farmers. This was about 6500 years ago. The farmers grew crops on the land which they had owned, or on land belonging to people. The farmer didn't grow crops on property belonging to himself. The story is from a science book. The narrator likes to study agriculture."," They started farming to make sure they had enough food to survive and also to eat the food they were growing. They used manure and crops to fertilise the soil. This helps the plants to grow. The first agriculture system used manure and was known as The Stone Age Agriculture. It was based on plants from the forest that were found and grown in the ground. Manure and other fertiliser were not the only means of growing crops. In Ancient Greece and Rome manure and crops were added to soil to improve fertility and increase crop yield. Today agriculture is based on similar principles but there are some slight changes in how it is grown and harvested. A modern agriculture system is an organised one. It is used to produce different types of crops that are required for the world to survive. In modern agriculture people use chemicals to increase yields. The first agriculture system, known as the Stone Age Agriculture was mostly organic and natural. It used natural fertilizers, grew plants from the forest and used manure. There were few crops and there were no modern machinery. The Stone Age Agriculture is the modern agriculture system which we will talk about in class. What can we learn about the modern agriculture system? It is organic and natural."
A2, But in the summer they can only sit under the ice to relax. The fish that stay in their little houses are called Ice-Fish. They are much smaller than the fish that live on the lake. They live there for nine months every year. Then they return to the sea.," They spend the winter months fishing, and in the summer they make money selling their catch to restaurants and restaurants. The lakes are full in the winter when the fish are caught. They are empty in the summer because they have no food to catch."," They are called ICE-FISHING. Forget about the fishing boat. This is winter. People are using big trucks and moving in huge numbers to bring winter in Canada. The people have left the place. In autumn, thousands of people travel to the lake each year in their own small boats to enjoy the beauty of autumn on the lake. Winter is a beautiful thing."," In summer the fish are more abundant. For two weeks every year Lake Nipissing holds a major festival called ""Fishing for Fish"". This festival is a huge opportunity for Canadian fishermen to sell their catch.

I said that because I am too naive to ask for help."," You must see your doctor' I said to him. After this I did not want to visit him again. One day I asked for his help.

If you have power lines, telephone lines, or cords near your home, it can be important to trim them so that they are no more than one foot or two feet away from the wall so that the risk of being burglarized is reduced. Also, it is important to make sure that no wires are visible near any of the doors and windows. These are the three areas we usually take into consideration when trying to prevent a burglary from happening but it is important to remember that burglaries do not happen overnight or during the day. It can happen any time when people do not pay attention.", Inspector Ian Saunders is hoping that it will be better when they realize that they can be safer while they are home. BURGLANCERS LOVE THE AFTERNOON The number of burglaries has gone up 30% compared with last year. Inspector Ian Saunders said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window," Why would it be? It's because after a night of drinking, people tend to forget to do everything. They fall asleep in the house and have a fun sleep at home. That's a good thing, as it means that they get caught before the police can arrive. The police usually catch a burglar in two hours if they can find them, but they need more time to find one that's drunk in the house. Inspector Saunders asked, ""Who do you think is in this story?"" The police inspector, Ian Saunders."," He explained that burglars have a variety of ways to break into a home. One way is to open the door, then grab someone and throw the victim to the ground. Another way is to smash the door into the door handle and grab something inside, or to force the victim to get out in the kitchen with the help of an accomplice, according to Inspector Saunders. In addition to trying to break into the house during the daytime, burglars are also more likely to try to steal at night. Inspector Ian Saunders said that in addition to the home burglaries, they also investigated more than 60 robberies committed in the park, at school, and other public places during the daytime. One of them was reported on the street. After a man and a woman went out for a walk in the park, a car mounted them and beat the men to death. The robbers then stole a bag containing $200. Inspector Saunders told the paper that in an effort to make the situation more serious, they had a patrol in the area on a daily basis and increased their patrols during the daytime. The police were so worried about the rising number of house burglaries that they had to create a daytime patrols, he said."," The police are determined to find the suspects in these burglaries by watching the suspects do their burglary at the time of the robbery. The following words will describe this passage: 1 sentence, 1 paragraph, 3 words The police will watch the suspects burglary because burglars love the evening."," In another part, the police told us about a woman who went missing.

A2," By the early 17th century, there were horses racing on the Old Bailey, England, and in London. Around 1560, the English were the first to introduce the jockeys to the horses. In 1619, an English horse racing meeting was held at Epsom Royal. From 1648 to 1652, a law established the Royal Jockeys' Company as the main governing body of horse racing in England. The first race was held in 1666, when there were 24 racecourses in Britain. By the early 1800s, over 2 million English horses were racing in the UK.", The horse's first appearance on the racetrack dates back to the 1930s. Horse racing has gone from a common sport to a highly lucrative sport.," Today horse racing is a huge industry in the UK, Europe and the US.
How much horse racing has spread The history of horse racing goes back thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians played a key role in horse breeding during the 5th century BC. By the 7th century the horse industry was huge in Roman Rome and horses were used for chariot pulling and pulling wagons. In the 13th century, Europe was still playing a key role in horse breeding and trade. The development of the printing press made horse racing more important in Europe than in any other place.
By the 18th century, European horses were much faster and the sport was very popular in Europe. The Arab horses brought to Europe in the 12th century became a favourite with Europeans. Horse racing spread throughout Britain and Europe by the 18th century. Most European horses are used to travelling long distances and are not used for racing. The first books written about horse racing were written in Greek and Latin in the 5th century BC. It was also important in ancient Greece and Rome. The sport spread in Europe by the 18th century, and became an important form of entertainment."," The modern horse racing career is more than 5,200 years long. It has enjoyed a great number of winners who have earned millions and billions. The sport has attracted millions of people all over the world. People across the globe enjoy watching horse racing and supporting the stars of the sport."," In the course of the next three centuries they were used for competition at a high rate of speed, and many of them went out to run on racetracks on every type of ground. Their first names were used: Arabian, Arabian Horse, Fletching, Laredo, Dandy, Zebra, and the name of the racehorse was used by the racetrack: The Grand National winner"," These were trained to race against each other to prove their breeding in Europe. As the horses raced at full speed, the speed at which they crossed the track was also increased. This meant that horse races became faster and safer than ever before. However, modern day racing does not necessarily use the same tactics of long ago. This text has not been well reviewed. In our grade-level students there is some grammatical and punctuation errors, including: Use of the word ""reach"" instead of ""rise"" The sentence would be ""The horse reached its highest speed during the race."" instead of ""The horse reached its highest speed during the race."""," It is still popular today with spectators around the globe.

A2, The Police were not very helpful. Some people used to throw things at them. They were only kept safe by their own body. No other help!," In 1598 the mayor of London asked the police to help clean up the streets. He asked them to pay them the money to clean up. But they refused saying that they only had to clean. The mayor then agreed to pay them 5 shillings in 1599. London Police Headquarters was built in the 17th century and police were paid 4 shillings an hour. In 1715 London Police were divided into two big areas, London and the south. In 1728 a division was made between the north and the west to reduce the cost of labour and to give the police better protection from enemy fire. In 1733 a division was made between west and east to help in the investigation of crime. In 1765 a division was made between the north, west and east."," People had to work for their living so they used to steal. But people didn't like the police because they were not very nice. So a few men from a wealthy family decided to give the police a new look and give them better uniforms, new guns, nice cars. The police started to live a very good life.", There were many robberies every day. One day one of the police men got in a row with the robber. He attacked the robber with a sword. The robber tried to kill the policeman but got away. Some time later the policeman was killed. The story ends with the policeman crying for help and a little girl asking him for help.," So to help out some of them, the rich people in town used to collect fares to hire police for their protection. This is the history of the London Police.", But the city people wanted a lot of food and they were happy because they didn't have to work. The city people made food by using tools and stones. The city people wanted to do things faster because it used to be so slow. When the city people were not making food enough they bought food from the country. The city people didn't like the idea of paying the taxes because they were getting less money for their food. They wanted more taxes and that would be easier for them to keep their money. About 200 years ago one day a young man was getting food from the country. He bought a sheep and a few pigs from the country. The man lived in London. He grew a lot of food. He lived happily because he had enough food to eat. But he wanted to stay in London for longer. He didn't want to go out and buy food because he had to be home and he worked very hard to make money. Then the older man who used to protect the streets moved away and the young man made more food for the city. The city people were happy because they didn't have to work. The man went to the country and bought a sheep and a few pigs and he grew a lot of food. He lived happily because he had enough food to eat. The older man used to protect the streets moved away. The young man bought food for the city and he also made his own food because he was so busy working. He didn't have much time to spend on protecting the streets.," One day a wealthy man was driving by and he saw a young boy lying on the streets. As the wealthy man approached to help the boy, the young boy saw the man pulling a stick. The boy ran away from the wealthy man's car and the wealthy man saw the boy being pulled up by the stick, he thought the boy was a beggar. But when he saw it was a long stick he did not believe it. When the man pulled the stick, he saw a small child pushing it. The wealthy man pulled it down to see who was pulling it. That was a policeman! People around the city came forward to say thanks to the man, who was called London. Then London set up a patrol of policemen to protect Londoners. The people around the city were very happy, everyone knew who to thank. So the London police were established. The boy pushing the stick in the story was a policeman who was named London. A policeman with a stick was called london, but in the past many people used long sticks called swords."

Tom said, ""Someone threw an orange at me!"" ""Then what did you do?"" Billy asked. ""Oh, I took a light. I got it out of the closet."" Tom said. Billy and Tom ran to Elliot. Elliot was not sure what happened. ""It was not very dangerous,"" Elliott said. Elliot, Tyler, Billy, Mary and Tom were talking. Elliott's mom was not talking."," ""Something very dangerous,"" Mary insisted. She took another light and then went into the yard. ""What else did you see?"" Elliott asked her. ""Something similar!"" Mary said. ""Oh dear!"" Elliott said. She put out her light. ""Oh, the cat! The cat threw the orange!"" Mary screamed and Tyler jumped into the yard and started to chase the cat."," Mary said, ""I've seen the same thing!"" Then she came out to the yard. ""Mary, there was nothing there!"" Mary said. ""I said the same thing!"" Mary said she didn't know what to do. They both walked down the steps. She looked around and there was nothing out there! Mary then left. ""Seriously,"" Tyler said, ""what kind of a trick is that? The trick is that there is nothing!"" Mary said she did not know. She just wanted her family to go home. Mary left and said she would call Elliott's mom if she heard anything, but she didn't. They looked out the window and there was nothing out there! Mary and Tyler stared at the ground. Tyler looked at Mary. Tyler laughed and said, ""That was a great trick Mary played on us!"" Mary looked at Tyler. Mary couldn't figure out why he laughed."," ""Oh, good! She threw it on purpose. It's very dangerous."" Mary was quite surprised. ""Well, it was. And I think that it's because it is a boy"" said Elliott. Mary said it was because there is a boy out there."

Suddenly she heard a door open..."," 'I'll try the door that is light.' Mary was right. The door was light. She closed it. She started to sleep, but when she closed the door it suddenly turned black.

A cat."," She pushed it open, and in the dark room, she saw a man. 'I think it's the sound again!' she thought. She sat down on a chair and the man entered. Mary sat up in bed and heard him talk. ""I can hear the sound you made when you went into the room with the light. The only thing I did was touch a switch. You did it to yourself, too."" Mary sat up in bed and said to herself. She turned out the light and saw that a man had been here. 'It's the sound again!' she thought. She stood up and was running out of the room. Mary was very frightened and ran back to the bedroom and tried to call the police. 'I hear your voice, Mary,' said the man. She started running again, but she saw a man at the door. 'It's the sound!' she thought. She tried to push the door open but didn't have the strength to do so. She turned to the door and heard someone talking with a man. 'It is the sound!' she said. She tried to open the door and suddenly it was locked. 'Don't you know that this door can't be opened?' the man said. The two locked the door and then took off.

She hit the bathroom floor and she died."," 'Why should I open this door' she thought. 'Perhaps it's some pest in the house'. She opened it. She heard a rat snoring in a cage. She looked around. It was dark in the corner of the room. She went back to bed. The noise stopped. Mary then left again. She heard a noise behind the door. Mary opened the door and there was a rat in the cage. 'Don't be ridiculous!' she said to herself. She closed the door, opened the cage, and took the rat away quickly. The next night she didn't sleep again. But it rained even harder."," There was a large, dark, and sad-looking face that looked out of the opening of the door. She walked on and got closer and closer and heard someone sitting on the floor. She approached the door and looked behind it, but no one answered. Mary looked again and there were three little girls on the floor asleep"," Mary walked on and entered. Mary saw a light under a door. Mary pushed it open. 'Hi! This is me.' Mary entered the house. She found a small room with a small table, chairs and a window. There she sat at the table. Mary sat there for a while. Then she moved to the chair and sat down. Mary sat down at the table. After a while she looked at the clock. It was 12 o'clock. She walked to the door and closed it. She locked it. She walked through the dark house and returned to the room. Mary sat at the table again. She sat at the table for a while. Then she looked at the clock. It was 11 o'clock.

A2," Children all the way up to adults were sitting by the elephants. The show was very short and the elephants were not in the action. After the elephants left the children started running, jumping and making the show for them. After some time the children were exhausted but the show was fun. I thought it was a lovely fairytale."," Inside a large enclosure there were several elephants. Some were standing at attention and some were dancing, jumping, and eating. Some were playing a game and some were sleeping in a grassy area. Inside the enclosure there were many other elephants. There were many kids visiting the elephant show. There were also many visitors to the park. Some people paid for tickets to see the show and some people didn't. The Elephant Show is a funny book but it is not easy to read because there are many sentences and the words are very strange."," The elephant trainer showed elephants performing tricks on each side of the square. This is what we saw for the first time: 
The elephant that performed most tricks was the older and bigger one. He had a long trunk and a big elephant trunk. He always got people to dance and shout. The crowd loved him. He did tricks for several minutes. Then he stopped and looked at the camera. Then he started a new show. This show took another couple of minutes to perform. The first show he did was a good one. It was funny and the audience loved it. He then performed another trick. His trunk flipped upside down as if he were going to throw something. People applauded loudly. After he did this he then began another show. He started with the audience applauding again. He didn't perform any tricks for a few minutes. Then he walked toward a huge pile of sand and started to play with it. I didn't know what this was about but it took me by surprise. Everyone in the park cheered loudly and the elephant started performing his show again. He began with everyone applauding. He made some more funny moves then walked towards the camera and began a second show. He did this for a few minutes. His show was interesting and it didn't last long. I love elephants and I enjoyed watching this show.", A big elephant was on top of the most central seat. It was accompanied by musicians. The music was pretty good! And the show was a total hoot! I got to watch and laugh a lot!," The elephant show took place in front of us with the elephants on top of it. I thought that all the elephants were sitting on the seats, but there were many in the audience who were standing in the grass by the show. When the show finished we walked back to our hotel."," The show was only open for 30 minutes. There were many elephants and giraffes but they all looked like they had only come to visit the square. The elephants were always in the same place while the giraffes always moved. We spent a lot of time looking at the show. Most of the sentences were too long. The story could be rewritten so that sentences were shorter and the story more readable. The story was clear, but some parts of the sentence needed to be cut down. The story was readable by Grade 2 students"," We got some small plastic buckets with water and then sat in the seats. One of the big men at the show was wearing a white shirt, blue jeans and blue hat. He was dancing to the music. He had a long yellow trunk with a long silver tail. I wondered if he was white or brown. He was dancing and jumping. I kept on asking him if he was white. He smiled. In some moments he kept turning to look at us. But he was too nervous to do it. After a while he began dancing. I could see the white and blue paint on his skin, but I couldn't understand what he was doing. I saw the other three men in front of him, but he never made eye contact with them. I asked the lady at the entrance to ask him what his name was and the lady smiled. The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop age 14 There was a lady sitting at the entrance to the park. She told us she could speak English and I asked if she could help us. I told her that I couldn't read the show for me and she said that the entrance girl would help me. She sat next to me in a chair and we watched the elephant. When I went to check on the others I realized that she was the only person that knew the show. She helped me understand the show because she also sang. The lady said that there would be a man with a white white shirt at the entrance every day. He walked through a big door into a room with two curtains. People would enter the room and sit at a long table. Some men would speak to him in a voice that was like an English accent. That was the person that was playing the music. The lady told me that the music was used to make it look like the show would be real. I told her that she had never seen this show but it looked real.

A2, A person with a good climbing skill can make a decent hike on this path. Other people prefer the much shorter Shira trail. The five-kilometre trail to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro is called the Marangu path.," The other three paths are dangerous because the trail is rocky, steep and there are many dangers on the way. In all the four paths there are many beautiful places in between."," In the early days, this path was often used by a person and his family. But as time went by, it became more popular with tourists. The Marangu is now an easy path to a six-mile path, which is one of the most famous routes to Mount Kilimanjaro."," The other paths are steep, very cold, and very dangerous. They only take four or five days, but they are much longer than the Marangu path. The people who climbed it in the Marangu path used to be children. They have many things to forget. However, people who climb it in the other three paths remember little. They can never forget the fear or cold or the hunger. Many people climb to the top of the mountain. It takes a lot of people. People climb the mountain every day. If a couple gets married, they climb it for two weeks. If they have five children, they can climb it for two and a half years.", Marangu path is in a forest. There are no lights and it can only be reached at night. People go to the mountain from Marangu village. Marangu village is not far away from the sea., The people climb the mountain on a daily basis. What is the word count in a sentence? The passage is about a man climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. The word count in a sentence is 30. It is a total of 30 words and 30 sentences., Where is Mount Kilimanjaro from ? Mount Kilimanjaro is from Africa. Where does it stand on Earth ? It stands on top of Africa. Where is Africa ? It is in the North-East corner of the globe.
A2," They didn't get a good answer. They said they thought it was the same amount of water that it had been sitting under the vessel. Not that it matters because they couldn't wait until good weather came to get away. As the ship took in the strong winds, Hayes heard rumble. He turned around and saw that the ship was moving fast down the sea. At that moment, he grabbed the sheet and pulled it off. Hayes looked down and saw a shipwreck under the sea."," But they wanted to be together in the dark. Englehorn's only thought was the good times that were to come. He was filled with thoughts of his love. As soon as they sighted land, Hayes walked on the ship's bow and told a man how dangerous it was. Englehorn and the other men made their way to the cabin. They found that each sailor was filled with his thoughts. Everyone wanted to go home. But for one reason or another, every person wanted to stay. In the meantime, Hayes and Englehorn had their conversation and were getting drunk. The captain left the ship. It was a rainy night as they left the ship. They had seen no sign of land. When the ship began to move across the sea, a gust came up and the ship rocked. The men started to panic. Hayes came on board. Everyone panicked. ""The Captain! The Captain is hurt!"" a man shouted. He tried to help the captain. The sailor yelled, ""What is the matter with them? What are they talking about?"" ""They just can't help themselves"" Hayes said, as he stowed his boat. The men stayed in the ship and tried to stay calm. They waited for good weather to make their way to land. But they didn't see any land. The sun set. The sailor turned on the lights and started looking for land. It was close at hand. They started looking for their boats. As the dark got deeper, the sailor turned to his companions and said, ""They are in the ship! They must be all dead!"" The men started to laugh. The captain said, ""This is not funny"" Then he tried to help the sailor. He said, ""Get the ship into port,"" and everyone began to jump off the ship, in search of the boat. The ship began to sink. The captain tried to calm everyone down and gave everyone a chance to get out. The sailors were dead."," They had to use the math and science departments to find out the answer to the question. The scientists on the ship were studying astronomy, mathematics, physics and chemistry. They put all their knowledge to work to solve the problem. All of their studies were very involved and complicated."," They weren't very fast so they hadn't gone under. They knew the depth of the water. They thought it would be a matter of minutes until they could find some way to get out. The ocean was very large. It was very deep with waves crashing over them. It had dark holes in it that could become very dangerous if the ship were knocked over. They kept being pulled by the strong currents. Finally a man gave them an answer and they made a boat to help them. They saw it was much deeper than they thought, almost to the top of the deck. It was a large empty room like a closet. And they made a ladder to reach the top. There was very little light, but when they touched the ceiling it was a different story. It was very dark with an old movie type effect, but it didn't harm anyone. It was just the walls reflecting and blocking the light. But this room was empty. No one was there. The sailors got out and climbed the ladder into the closet. They couldn't get out. They walked up the ladder slowly to find a passage to the deck. But the ladder came down at the top of the closet. It was impossible to get off without getting it down first. They didn't see the sea floor, they saw the dark closet. They had to try the same thing they tried on the ceiling. They walked slowly through the closet like a person climbing down a big ladder. They reached the bottom, they stepped down, and they were very close to the surface of the water. When they reached the deck they were very surprised, because they could see that they were still on the ship and not in the ocean. The boat had been dragged into the sea by the currents. But there was no boat on it. They realized this too late, so they jumped off the deck, but they..."," They wanted to know because they'd heard it mentioned as a possible answer. Now they were on a ship that was sinking because they were going to catch a fish on a raft, so when they got on the raft they started throwing away the fish."," As one sailor said, ""There are too many words on this page. The total number of words in the passage is 9.1 thousand."" The passage was 9,100 words in length. The total number of words in the passage is 9.1 thousand."," Their ship had three water tanks. One would have been full, two would have been empty. They needed to know how much water was in each tank. They didn't know how to calculate the water level. They tried using the old trick of comparing volume to weight. But it didn't work out. They looked up the answer to the problem on a map. They were able to calculate the water levels as they walked around their ship, and compared them to each other. It wasn't the easiest answer, but it was the right answer they needed. ""That's a very clever way to find the water levels,"" said Hayes."

B1," Instead, Kal took on more opportunities, earned a reputation as a trusted advisor and helped her parents open their own store. Her parents were very proud of her but, as a teenager, Kal had to learn that there were times when she was not allowed to spend time in her own room.", The parents were shocked when they came to find out.

The snow and ice will be covered over in the winter months but there will be light all around."," This was achieved by having a new hotel with rooms all facing the ice that lay around the entire property. The best rooms were on the upper floor, facing a great bay facing the Arctic Ocean which the guests were able to view. It was a very modern hotel with modern decor. It was a popular hotel in the winter but not so much in the summer. The guests would often not have wanted to stay here but it did produce good income in the winter season. A lot of people would also get rich with the tourism. The hotel was popular. The rooms were full but there were not enough beds. It was quite popular and many more people had rooms in the upper floors. People would often watch the sun rise when they came back to their rooms.", The IceHotel was opened. How was it? It was designed as a shelter against the cold. What is a shelter? A place that you can stay when things go wrong.," For the next 15 years a hotel called the icehotel developed around a large building in the southwestern Arctic. What would you like to know about the hotel?
What happened to the hotel? It became a business", Winter is the season to be active. People enjoy the cold and long day. A group of engineers were hired to build a hotel to be called The Icehotel. This was designed to be the last stay before the last winter. The engineers were working away while people enjoyed the summer time.," The hotel manager ordered a big new building, with enough room for every single guest the world would ever have to stay in it. He started construction on a big and bright new hotel. He wanted it to be modern and appealing enough to draw the international tourist to the frozen lands. For every piece of his construction a piece was put into the land where it would be used. His hotel was complete. The next thing was to open the doors to the international tourist. All they would need were an umbrella or coat for the cold, as well as a big umbrella when they came out of the hotel. The hotel was ready for the opening but there was one more problem. They needed to attract the international tourist."," The hotel where they would stay was just one of many other hotels opening all across the country. Today the hotel has become famous for its unusually luxurious suites that are specially designed for people with cold weather. The new suite was a unique concept, a hotel for the very rich and famous."
B1, A few hundred people had come out on the ski moors behind Tower Ridge. The sun was warming the skis and the first rays of sunlight made our skin burn red on the snow. The wind was gusting hard and the wind chill was around minus 40 degrees. Climbing to the top of Britain Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland and because of its northerly location the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. A few hundred people had come out on the ski moors behind Tower Ridge. The sun was warming the skis and the first rays of sunlight made our skin burn red on the snow. The wind was gusting hard and the wind chill was around minus 40 degrees.," We were travelling with another party of climbers so it was cold, wet and snowy. It was a real challenge to climb the mountain. At first we were climbing in the dark. But with our guide Keith we got the hang of it. As we got closer and closer to Tower Ridge it got warmer but we had a lot of wetness on the climber clothes so it was tricky getting up the mountain. We eventually got to Tower Ridge but the weather was still freezing. We did our first climb of the year and got to the top early so had a bit of time for tea and a chat and to have a good time.", The temperature was just over five degrees on the summit and it was freezing in the morning. Keith used a pair of long pants and my jacket to form an easy warm body cover and went to the base to help with the climbing rope. The climbing in the snow is always tricky but it's easy as you are going straight up. After being on the top of Britain it was so cold and freezing on the base. Keith used a hat and gloves to help warm himself and went back on the summit to help another climber up the North Face. It was a very cold day there. One climber started to cry as he made his way up the side of the mountain. He had done his calculations as the next climber had climbed ahead of him. He had to give way. He didn't realise he was going to be frozen to death. But he didn't look back. Keith was really careful. All he could see in the darkness was one arm. Luckily it was only his left arm which hurt him. The climber looked at his left arm and thought 'How can he have it?' but he continued on. Eventually he climbed the final ridge and finally made it to the summit. Keith had climbed to the summit of the mountain and had got a nice view. His first time on the mountain had been amazing. He didn't think twice about it.," We would cross the snowy North Foreland Pass to get up the south side of the mountain, the highest point of the route, Tower Ridge. The next stage would be up Tower Ridge itself, which is about 800 metres above sea level. I didn't want to climb too high to avoid getting frosty, so I chose Tower Ridge as it would be above the base of the mountain. In the back of my head I pictured myself with snow under my arm, and with the thermometer reading as low as minus 10C. At first it was a bit of a struggle for me to get over the fence on Tower Ridge. There were also some rocks around to take into account. It was quite icy. When we were half way to Tower Ridge we got into the rock garden on the north side. It took a lot of time to scramble up the rocks to the top. There was a little bit of frost on my arm, I think it was a few degree below zero. After the climb I got to the top of the ridge where we can see the peak, but that was it. I was already pretty disappointed. It was quite cold, and the conditions were not so good for climbing. I had hoped that we could go up and enjoy a rest, but we had to return as quickly as possible to Tower Ridge. So we had to climb down, it took us about an hour to get from Tower Ridge to Tower Ridge. The descent was quite straight and easy, about the same steepness as we had gone up. We had to walk on a little bridge to go down the rock garden, but this wasn't too bad, it was just the kind of walking that is required to go up the mountain. As soon as we got down the rock garden on the south side, we had to walk up another section of rock garden to find the north side of Tower..."," There were a couple of other climbers and we were sitting under some mist and making do with a campfire. We could just hear the wind moaning in the trees. That afternoon the frost had been deep and the mist was lifting from the ground. It seemed to be about a hundred and forty degrees inside. The mist and the frost were very cold, but we felt the wind and the frost was really warm. When we got to Tower Ridge the temperature was just over one hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit. The first part was tricky because the ascent was straight up the mountain. Then we turned to the right to make a big right turn at the bottom and made the steep climb that leads up to the peak. It took a few hours to climb the rocky part of the mountain. When we got to the top we were in absolute sunshine, just the same as if we were on the top of the UK. It was amazing.", Tower Ridge is situated in the centre and the south of the mountain where the glaciers flow over rocks. It was a beautiful day with beautiful views. Climbers ascend the mountain and begin their descent. They took about a week to climb it. There were only four people on the route. Keith," I had climbed many other mountains but was not familiar with the high steep slopes. We were climbing at 5,000 feet above sea level. One of the steep slopes I was about to walk on was one of the most steep slopes in the mountains. It went all the way to the summit. We got ready to start the climb and Keith took a deep breath. I was scared to climb the steep slopes but Keith pushed me up the mountain to the summit of the hill. We crossed the summit, came back down the mountain and climbed down the other steep slopes. They went around and around all the steep slopes. It was hard work but I felt happy and strong. I was very pleased with my first time and had fun doing the climbing. It was a great experience. I have been climbing since I was eight. I always enjoyed climbing. They were also doing it on Ben Nevis. It was an amazing experience because I saw the views up there. I also saw Mount Vinson and Mount McKinley. It's beautiful at night time."
B1," My only purpose of going to university was to enjoy myself and to study something which could potentially be interesting when I got to my age. My mother was very happy with my decision and was happy to see me graduate. I spent most of my time at university working in the library, and studying. I enjoyed the freedom to think and write freely. I wanted to go to university so badly that I had started writing an essay about why I wanted to go which was going to include anything I wanted to say about university. I would have probably started at the age of seventeen like most of my peers. Now I have had a good amount of time to think about what I wanted and what I need to do now that I have finished my degree. I do not feel the need to go back to my job as secretary as I think now is a time for me to do something else which has more of an interesting challenge. I know that I should not go back to my job as a secretary but I am just tired of doing what I am now and I do not know what else to do with my life. I think the time is right for me to change jobs. There is something I should do that is more interesting for me. I will need to find a job to do for a while, for my health is suffering from the stress from my job."," I felt I had more time to learn and grow. For one of my professors in the English language department she would ask students to take long written essays. I thought I should try to make my own way out of the problem so I did some research and found out that long writing assignments were the norm at that university. One of the professors told me that I should read books and write essays, the most important thing would be to have a good vocabulary. I had a very interesting experience in my first year, I managed to develop an excellent vocabulary and started to learn English as an adult."," The only thing I ever had to do was write, write, write. I started at university hoping to make a new and different start, but the first year was no different than previous years. My only difference is that I had the choice to choose the classes I wanted to take. My experience so far has been disappointing as every class was too difficult and I couldn't catch on to the material. For me it is very important to get the subject out of my mind. I need to see it as a journey rather than as a chore to be done. My only regret at this stage of my life is that I could not have had a better teacher."," I could have worked anywhere else, I could have gone into business. I am glad that I went. I am glad that I got my degree from a top university I could get a part time job with at the end of the semester.", However I found a degree to do something that I love. My favourite subject is maths. I am very good at it. I enjoyed taking part in all classes in the college and in the summer as a tutor. I would highly recommend this to anyone. As an older student I wanted to learn something new so I started a course on Facebook. I found it to be a great idea and it was my dream to teach maths for fun. The teacher was so kind and helpful. I learnt all the important facts quickly and was very happy about it., At the same time I always wanted to write professionally but never got round to doing so. I was never a great student but at 32 I decided it was high time I started something constructive. I found the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale online and I set a goal to grade my first novel using it. It looked easy enough but it was far from simple. I had just completed another novel and I needed to keep myself motivated as well as my grade., The thought of school I had left me sick. College I think is a different story. All I know is I never left school and now I have finished. All I know is I never left school and now I have finished

Now I race in women’s events, I run 5k and 10k events and I am currently training for my first half marathon.", These people are afraid of the unknown and never give up until they get what they want. A run dub would show women that they are running in a positive environment where we can support one another.," I wanted to break the stereotypes of runners in a female audience. So, I started running dubs for women.  After two years I ran one myself and when I started to make a profit I decided to create the Women's Running World."," For instance, many race organisers won't give enough time to runners or will turn their backs on the runners when they need help. For these reasons, I decided to set up the running dub as a non-profit.", After trying out many different runners I decided to work with a girl from a charity organisation that helps older women in the community run events. I knew I would need an experienced runner to help them improve and to introduce women to the sport so I contacted the charity and they contacted me after I contacted the race organisers. After looking back at my life in my early years I realised that I had always been busy so I felt I would not be able to continue with this project., Title The author used the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale to grade the writing. What grade is the writing?

There are also other plants and animals that surround Grasslands, such as trees, fungi, and bacteria. Animal feed on grass.

B1," He then contacted the coach of Maria's team to ask if he could organise a meeting with the coach for further discussion and support. This was a move by a local person who had been given a piece of land by the government, but there are still many girls like them. They will never be accepted into the sporting system unless the government takes action to ensure that women are given equality of opportunity."," He began working with her and she went on to become a world football champion.

See more of Maria Mutola on Facebook"," In 2010 the local media in Mozambique used the story to campaign for equality for people with disabilities. Scroll down for video 
 
 In 2010 the local media in Mozambique used the story to campaign for equality for people with disabilities. For instance, a local newspaper's editorial board published a column which reminded readers to support and defend the rights of disabled people. Many businesses including a sportswear brand and hotel owners, offered discounts and loans for disabled athletes. In the end the campaign won approval and equality for people with disabilities was established in the country. This was the first major move towards equality in Mozambique. 
 
 However, at the time of the campaign, the government did not recognise the existence of a disabled people. The country was under Communist rule and a senior official declared that all citizens were 'as good as born without any disability'. However, local media reported that the government had made a breakthrough. They said the new regulations had recognised the existence of disabled people. Later it was learnt that this was just a publicity stunt. It has emerged that the government in Mozambique was unaware of the existence of the disabled people. It had a plan to introduce a quota system for disabled people and disabled sports in schools. 
 
 In 2013 the government made further progress by recognising the right of all Mozambicans with disabilities to a degree of equality. This means, the government has recognised the existence of disabled people and they have the right to participate in society in the same way as others. The government has also recognised the right of all disabled people to a disability-specific education (DSE) and vocational training (VT). 
 
 The government has also been working to increase the social awareness of the disabled. Several TV channels and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been set up to raise awareness about the existence of the disabled people in society. Many people have responded to these social media platforms with humour and encouragement to support the rights of the disabled people. 
 
 In 2014 the government launched a national day of celebration for equality for people with disabilities. In addition, the Ministry of Justice has established an intersectoral commission to coordinate the development of policies to deal with...", He set up a training camp in a remote farm in Mozambique and trained her and many other girls around the world. It took seven years to get to this point because Maria was the last of the players before the club went into administration. And when Maria finally played for the last time she played in a team of eleven girls.," He invited her and another girl named Isabel to join his football club. In early 1991 he organised a game between a girls' team from his club and a boys team from another club. The result of the game was a 3-0 win for the girls. Mr Jose Craveirinha invited the two girls to play again and, following the first match, the boys were beaten in the second. The next day the boys club was given the task of organising another match. In spite of this Mr Jose Craveirinha and his wife were unable to recruit any more girls. 'It was difficult to get girls to play football, they were afraid of the boys,' said Mrs Craveirinha. 'But that was just the beginning.' Maria is not the only example in Mozambique. Several other players have come out from high school to join men's clubs due to fear of being defeated. In fact according to local media many players say that they have had a mental breakdown because of it. The fear of being beaten is one of the most common reasons girls cannot compete in football. However this does not necessarily apply to all parts of Africa. In some African countries such as Algeria, girls are allowed to play football. However, they are often treated by their parents as inferior to boys, and this can hamper their chances of playing professionally.

She said 'It's just not fair that we can't all have a chance to represent ourselves in the Olympics.' In 2005 the team of London 2012 won their third gold medal with a record-breaking 7 gold medals.

B1," The Balloon Fiesta, or what is more commonly known as the balloon festival, is for people who enjoy balloonry. Over two million people visit the Albuquerque Balloon Festival every year. In the 1970s the festival featured the first free flying of a balloon for a celebration. The Albuquerque Balloon Festival has come a long way and is now an annual event. The second year in the 1970s, this balloon was the first in the world to fly completely free of charge to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the radio station. An inflatable balloon, it flew for nine hours.", For two decades this celebration was held as a solo show by a woman named Sandra Dee.  All photographs in this text have been used by Sandra Dee (see credits), The first balloon festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. As part of the festival there are many colourful balloons in the sky. The best way to understand this celebration is to attend.," Since then, the balloonists have flocked to this city every year. Each year, the festival is celebrated with special shows, carnival rides, balloon races and other activities. A few people might tell you that this is not worth the money but I think not. In case you like to enjoy the colourful light show in the sky, you can rent out a balloon from any small party venue like this for a day or more. Also remember to bring a long-stay car battery, preferably lithium type, to ensure that your balloon will withstand the intense heat of the balloon. If you enjoy ballooning but are a novice, you might need a guide, a friend or some other experienced balloonist to have fun! As far as the food is concerned, if you're going to enjoy the traditional colourful foods of the Mexican cuisine, you're going to need some money, and not much. If you're an ordinary customer, there's plenty of affordable and good tasting food if you don't mind having a little taste of Mexican or Mexican inspired cuisine. If you don't like Mexican food, you might find something else to suit your tastes but I would recommend trying Mexican style tacos. On a regular Sunday morning, the festival hosts a festival carnival that is a great opportunity to check out the colourful light show in the sky while mingling with other balloonists, local residents and guests. The festival carnival is the highlight of the festival and you won't want to miss it."," The original site was on a dirt runway at the Albuquerque Airport in 1973. Each year the balloon festival takes place on a different location. In 1978 a new permanent site was founded with an additional runway for better air circulation, and in 2007 it moved to its present location at the Phoenix Tower in downtown Albuquerque.

B1," However, the Egyptian society of that time was conservative and there were no female doctors. So Hypatia never studied medicine, but studied mathematics and astronomy. Hypatia was married to a local doctor. She had ten children, four sons and four daughters. Many of the students were very talented and there was a great scientific pride among the community of Alexandria. It was Hypatia that first developed the scientific notation. When the Greek mathematician Plato wrote his great treatise On the Origin of Species in the early 2nd century A.D., he made use of it. He referred to the mathematical notation developed by his teacher."," Hypatia studied mathematics, logic and philosophy, even went to Athens to learn from scholars. One of her teachers once described her as ""one of the greatest students I have ever had."" After studying under many famous scholars Hypatia eventually left Alexandria and went into exile. She taught her students on a ship in the Mediterranean Sea. At first she was considered an anti-clerical revolutionary and was eventually granted refuge by the emperor. But when the time came to return home, she was banished and eventually died in exile."," Hypatia taught mathematics and astronomy and was known for her ability to think ahead in science. She was very successful and earned a wide reputation. In many parts of the world she was an icon, even a legend. She was born, died, studied and taught many scientists. Many called her the Mother of Science. By what title did she be known for? The mother of science.", She had a hard time fitting in because of her beauty and she even tried to run away. She was even threatened with death. Hypatia's father finally made up his mind and sent her to a school of mathematics and physics to train for her career. From there she pursued her studies at Athens. Hypatia's mother and sister were also well educated. The first women scientists Hypatia and Anaximander met after graduating. Hypatia was called by the men who were studying mathematics and met Anaximander. They studied together and became a couple.," Hypatia did not follow in her father's footsteps but left her own path. She became a mathematician and played an important part in creating the modern form of geometry. For this she was honoured by Alexandria University, which called her ""Dame"". At the age of 26 she became the most successful female student in the history of the school. She spent years studying maths and philosophy and eventually began teaching mathematics, which became the basis of astronomy and geometry. While teaching at Alexandria, the school received a request for her opinion on an issue of science. She rejected the request because the request didn't have any science and said the request would be rejected the same way. The request asked for her opinion on a group of animals whose behaviour was unknown. The question was put to many mathematicians who said they had no idea what they were talking about. One woman mathematician named Pythagoras was asked the question and he thought that the animal's behaviour must be related to their size. He found that the smaller the animal was, the faster they ran away from a predator. In the same area, the other woman was asked the same question and he said they were simply a bunch of lazy and clumsy animals. Both were right and the two animals were classified as a species."," She was also the first woman to become a doctor. The second man in the story became a famous author.

B1, We had our very first dance together and I think it was our first real dance together! I think it was very magical. We danced the samba and I saw a funny little guy dancing to my left. We had so many adventures together in the first year., I made some friends from the class and had a great time. My favorite part was the ballet moves. The other students looked relaxed but I was happy as it felt like I was part of a family., We were laughing a lot together and we made friends right away. The second day was harder because I was tired and I could barely speak to anyone. We still got along and made friends. I think if I had stayed here more I would have become one of the students from our school., All the teachers were friendly and we were encouraged to try out for the group. During the year I was also the first to be chosen to be on a tour. I was picked to be with the school on one of their tours so it was like having friends in Russia for the first time. But the best part of joining the Kirov Ballet was that I got to dance with the girls. I loved the dancing and I was able to watch them perform on stage. I couldn’t believe that there were only Russian girls in the ballet. When my dance class was over everyone said that I’d learnt a lot but that they still had to learn more. This was the first time they asked me questions as a foreigner. I asked them questions like why they were wearing what colour socks and how many bras and underwear they wore. I thought I wouldn’t understand them but the girls in class said they were very understanding. I have never been a fan of the Russian language so I had no idea what they said so I had to google it. After the summer vacation I will go back to school to learn more Russian and I hope to be able to live there for the rest of my life., I started to dance and then the first teacher asked me to hold my hand up to everyone to show I was in the class and wanted to join. When I got home I told everyone about it and my parents invited me to go dancing with them!, I was very nervous because there were so many people around me and I didn’t know how to talk. One of the first classes wasn’t quite right. I felt really shy and did not know where I was. My teacher knew that she could see that there was something wrong but did not tell me. I am very happy to say that since the next one I’ve always learnt quickly. I am learning so quickly because I feel like I am here for a very long time as I have the chance to see different things everyday. A good teacher always supports and encourages the student. She gives advice on how to speak and what to do. Every week a new work is chosen and we have to perform that in front of the whole class. I think that being in a good environment with good teachers is very important.," I had a hard time understanding what they were saying. At the end I couldn’t speak Russian and it was impossible for them to understand what I was saying because I couldn’t speak their language. But I tried really hard and every time they asked for a dance I gave the same answer. But they didn’t like me for not saying something new in Russian. At the end of the class, they told us we would have to go home."

B1," But now they are made of various styles of animation. Many people prefer watching cartoons with no words. So instead of words it may be used drawings to convey the story, such as a cartoon of an animal running away. Children and adults are watching more animation films."," However, during the last 20 years or so, the trend has started to change. In 2000 and 2002 the number of older people attending cinema has gone up and now there are more older people going to cinema than there are younger people. In the past this was seen as unusual, now it's common practice. A good example is when a woman who turns 70 is granted a birthday card from the cinema. You can say things like, 'Because the cinema is special, you've been allowed to enjoy a special treat.'"" In 2000 there were only a few examples of this in the UK. In 2001 the number of cinema-goers over the age of 40 increased from 7,6% to 9,2%. This led to the debate about whether people over 40 should be allowed to watch cartoons. In 2002, more than 12% of all cinema-goers were aged 40 years or older. In 2003 the number of older cinema-goers was 10,1% and it is likely that this number will continue to increase. In recent years it has become increasingly common to have them at the end of the films.

THE '70S Cartoons

A very important time for the development of cartoons in the U.K. and America

'70s cartoons often featured new ideas and computer programs. Cartoon artist Roy Spencer. Spencer created a cartoon on an old typewriter using the first computer that was made for commercial use. After years of study, the computer program called MS-DOS was introduced to the world on June 1st, 1985. A year later Apple Computer made the introduction of the first Macintosh computer, followed by personal computers and tablets, like the Apple Lisa. The computer industry became much more competitive as the U.S. began to rely less on Japan for products because of nuclear war in the Vietnam War. Some important things that can be remembered about the '70s cartoons:

- The first computer that was made for commercial use was used by Roy Spencer. He made a cartoon with the use of the first computer. - Roy Spencer is an American who creates the most common characters in U.S. cartoons. Spencer came from an artistic family and began his career in the early 1950s. He started to work with a cartoonist called Tom Yates. Spencer is the most widely recognized creator in the U.S. Cartoons industry. - In the '70s a few cartoons showed negative messages. Some of them used violence and crude language. Spencer is an American and he uses a different style of cartooning. In some situations he is also very graphic and explicit in language. Roy Spencer created the character Mr. Peanutbutter. Spencer and his family moved from Los Angeles to New York. He gained fame through the use of colorful cartoonish characters called Mr. Peanutbutter, Miss Buttercup and Donutbutter. Spencer has also created other cartoon characters like SpongeBob SquarePants. - Mr. Peanutbutter was a famous character. Spencer began making the character in 1956. Spencer's creator was Tom Yates. Spencer is also known as the Father of American Cartoons. - Some children were unhappy with the way these cartoons were made for children. Spencer started making cartoons for adults in the '70s. In the '80s Spencer began to create a new style for cartoons. Spencer believes the...", People are now showing more and more adult cartoons on television and film. This is because there are so many factors that can influence their choice. How would you describe Cartoons? Movies," Since the word ""children"" is of limited meaning and often used to imply very young people, a number of words that were considered inappropriate for children were changed into word beginning with the letters C"," In the early 80s, in America there was talk about a move towards comedy in cartoons. In the late 80s and early 90s a new style of comedy emerged that was full of light humour and light-hearted jokes. At the beginning of the 2000s new cartoonists started making more realistic images. In the current era, new technology is used to make cartoons on the computer."
B1," ""The five-year-olds know what they're doing, they know how to play. They already understand the world."" For adults, it is sometimes difficult to imagine life without music and many of us feel lonely when we are away from the sounds of music. But for someone like the five-year-old who has become part of an international musical culture of which she would probably know nothing if she had not developed such strong artistic abilities. Margaret Porter's life of a young musician is not the norm for most children. She is from England and is just as capable as a seven-year-old in terms of composing music and performing with her four-year-old son. Margaret has just come back from a four-week stay in America for three months where she has played the violin and music theory classes with children. She explains that she has enjoyed her experience, which has been very different to her life in England. There are no more formal musical instruction for most children in England. The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six, says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret who lives in London prefers to take pupils at three and four although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. ""The five-year-olds know what they're doing, they know how to play. They already understand the world.""

""The five-year-olds know what they're doing, they know how to play. They already understand the world."" For adults, it is sometimes difficult to imagine life without music..."," Margaret believes it's at these ages that you will most fully enjoy playing the violin and be able to express the beautiful harmonies on it. She does however have a theory about the best time for a child to begin learning music. She says: ""Well, there are two reasons why - firstly it is important to learn about the world, and the other is the ability to communicate. I believe that a child's learning begins to take hold at a much younger age than you would think."" But what is it that causes a child to learn to play the violin so well? The answer is learning how to use the basic rudiments of music and not just playing notes. Learning music is just like learning to walk and running. It's a process that goes on with each and every day. This is the same for learning how to play the violin. It takes practice, repetition and determination to play. But what is it that makes the difference? There are five key ingredients that make up the most successful violinists:  Brain, heart, muscles, technique, and personality. And these five things - if we are being honest - are as hard to develop as a child can imagine, but they can be worked towards. It's like any other skill. It takes practice, repetition and determination. To learn how to play the violin well it is important to be very patient with yourself. This is the hardest thing of all to build. It takes time and effort to develop the perfect technique and a firm grasp on the rudiments of playing the violin. It is not something that you get to learn just for fun and having fun. No one, no kid, no child of any age will instantly learn how to play the violin. It..."," She has been teaching her five-year-old daughter Sara since she was two. Sara has just turned five and is already in the violin class. She will be five soon, too.
Margaret doesn't set a time limit. She believes that as well as learning when to start, it's important to learn right from the start. Her approach is based around building a relationship with the child, not forcing or training the child. The way she teaches is with a real need to understand the student, not a theory of music based on books."," ""They make some wonderful strides in just a few weeks,"" she says. Margaret says you should start learning the violin when you are three years old and still like it. You should keep the instrument in the same location throughout the year so it is easy to get at. Try to keep it at the same spot in the house so children won't lose it and make sure you have a spot in the playroom so that it isn't in their way when playing other instruments.", She says that children learn best at their age when they are not overloaded. She advises them to start in primary school or when they are seven to eight years of age with six months to a year of learning in each of the three years. The following passage was taken from an interview conducted with the author and not to be taken as an endorsement of the author's views.," At the age of eight, Margaret believes it can be a good idea to start with reading in the early elementary school years. How can she explain the value of reading and the importance of starting in elementary school? ""Children begin to think, speak, and read at the age of three to six, so reading for pleasure helps the brain to form and develop,"" says Margaret. It not only improves children's intelligence, it also boosts their mood and helps them with problem-solving skills,"" she says. In general, children learn when they are young. But when is it best to start teaching these skills? The answer is at a young age. To hear and understand children and why they understand the world around them, reading should be started as early as possible. The more early you start with reading, the more positive your early years can be in terms of your children's early development. Some children, however, will never be able to see their own futures unless their minds are trained in the right way. As you can see, for learning the world, reading should be given more importance"," As for her violin teaching she is able to teach pupils from three and six years if they have a passion for the instrument and are serious about learning.  If the student is already a good violinist it will be better to skip to four rather than two or three. Margaret advises that all learners should start with music and play it from the age of three. Margaret has the unique ability to see and feel the love in her pupils and she likes the fact that her pupils always come to her singing for fun and play their violins. After playing a bit of music the pupil may ask how many notes are on the violin? After a few minutes of singing the pupil will usually realise that every four notes have a musical name. Some pupils like to make musical note of this fact for memorising the music on the violin. It's not necessary that all the musical note on the violin have a name as you can simply remember that every four notes have a name after a few hours of playing and singing. But for some children it is very helpful to be able to say which musical note is a sharp, an arch and a flat. If a pupil is singing with a group there is always a good chance of singing the same melody over and over again. There is always a chance of missing a musical note or two during the song which you won't notice immediately. When the pupil is a little older they will start to realise that one musical note has a name, which makes it much easier to learn. All the pupils at the Violin School are asked to make a musical selection from their choice of musical notes after a few months of music teaching. The students are expected to be able to find a melody which they like in a selection of musical notes and sing it. In order to do this the student is expected to memorise a melody which they..."

B1," The Ghan also crosses the Tasman Sea in the middle of the journey so that it will be taking several days to make its journey if the weather is bad. For now, the Ghan is the only way that people cross the Australian continent from north to south, so even if it is delayed there is not an alternative but to simply turn around. At the South Australian city of Adelaide where Ottaway arrived he was greeted by the Ghan's chief engineer, Mr Charles Coughlan. Coughlan had traveled the world traveling the famous Ghan. He had been looking forward to the journey, knowing that it would be a challenging one, with many other passengers traveling through what was a fairly dusty, dusty journey. Charles Coughlan is an engineer who had travelled the world before travelling by train. He now worked in the Ghan and was known as the chief engineer.

Some of the trains also travel on a different route than the official line, causing confusion for passengers. There are numerous railways in Australia and every train has an associated train ticket which helps people to stay organized. Here you will find the Ghan's train schedule"," A long time ago, a Ghan train arrived on the Southern Ocean from the colder northern coasts to Adelaide. When the train slowed to a stop at a station, a man called the waiters to bring him a meal. He ordered a bowl of steaming tea and served it while he listened to the train whistle past him. All of the people on board the Ghan were in their sleep. The man on the train woke up in a sleepy state as he waited for the train to pass again. He was awakened by the train whistle again. The man woke up as he was awakened. He looked at the time but it was not very far until the train passed again. He watched the train go by while he ate his bowl of tea. 
 
 Mr Ottaway's tale is typical for any train journey. The train journey is an enjoyable one, but it can be tiring. This would be a very good place to start a lesson on travelling by train."," The journey took a week from Darwin to Adelaide. Ottaway is excited to go on the train with his friends. On his return home, Ottaway will get home much earlier and he is very excited as he has the train on a Sunday."," Ghan can be heard on the BBC, which broadcasts it throughout the nation. It was not the busiest rail line in the country. On many days the train was not full but there was still people on board.

There were three locomotives running the train and Ottaway enjoyed travelling through the countryside. He had a good view from the coach which he sat in. Ottaway lived in Australia, but came to Darwin in 1880 to seek a better life. He lived in a hut on the edge of the town. He had one servant who he trained and had worked hard throughout the day. A servant can be a maid, cook or domestic helper. Ottaway also had a friend who walked his horses and drove his car. He had horses because he loved the game and liked to ride, but he had to keep them because the roads in his hometown were rough. He also helped his friends by selling cheese. In the days when you lived in a hut, you had to make your own cheese which made a good preservative and a good topping for fish and meat. Ottaway would often sell his cheese to his friends. He loved the smell of cheese making in his father’s shack on the edge of town. He remembered his father teaching him how to make cheese. Ottaway was also a member of the town church, although he did not have any formal religious beliefs. The Ghan also travelled from Darwin to Adelaide, but sometimes there wasn’t enough money. He sometimes travelled a long distance on foot. He would often leave the city and spend days wandering on the outskirts. On one occasion Ottaway stopped at a small country road to get food.

B1," While I was there I saw a number of foreign students with their British nationalities. Some were French, some from South Africa, some from Spain, Germany, England, Italy and elsewhere. I saw many different nationalities all going into a college so excitedly. What a great chance.", Some of them are preparing for their A-Levels while others go on with their Higher Education Studies. There were students who were doing their Honors degrees and some were doing Bachelors and Masters. My favourite was the Master's student who studied the business and financial management. She had lots of experience and I think she would be a great future manager. The student was sitting in front of me so she was talking to me. She had a wonderful smile and I could feel her confidence. She was one of the great things about Atlantic College. I didn't know she had come from England and she was speaking English and Spanish. They were both fantastic and very well integrated in the students and in the environment., They do not study for their exams until afternoon. They have a tour of the beautiful campus and a guided tour into the building that houses the library and computer room. They also get a tour of the building where their dormitory is. Most of them do not know where they will stay at the end of the school year. There is an extra room reserved for them. They have a day off in the afternoon that is usually spent relaxing on the beach (if possible) or visiting the town where they come from (if the parents allow it).

In the evening they can spend some time at home, or out at the cinema, or go to the sports club. There is so much to do and they always say, ""How much I would love to do all this when I was 17!"" They get on very well with their teachers, and if you are interested you can learn more by going to the main website They really do put me into the right environment for my studies. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity. Sam"," It is a great facility for anyone wanting to gain experience of studying for their exams and also improving their English . The college is run by great people who want to help the students to succeed. The students are made to look like a success rather than a failure, this is very different to the current education system."," They have their lunch then study the afternoon and so on. What I have experienced in this college was amazing in all the best ways. It had me thinking of the need for a new culture of learning that could challenge the current one. I would not have known what it was to be young if I had not spent time there. I spent my time in Cardiff which was perfect for the young people. It is beautiful, beautiful and there is so much to do. There was so much to see and a lot to experience in Wales. It is so easy to live there and very good public transport is very good. All the university students at the college are wonderful young people, so much so that it was hard to move. I was sad when I left but I loved having the chance to see a new culture of learning. As a student at Atlantic College I felt I had a lot to learn, to be exposed to new things and meet different kinds of people that could be of help in my job."," They are usually either from a school or college in a foreign country. It is not surprising as it is a very good place to study. First impressions of the college are good. I know this because I spent a week there studying English. I can tell you about the good life experience that I had and the environment that I had. They have two very nice and clean buildings, one on the ground floor and the other on a second floor. There are many big trees, lots of green areas and a pool. There are also many good teaching staff there who are really helpful. They give you a lot of tips about studying for your exams and how to improve your English. The students are quite interested in learning English at school in their country because they are used to the English language there. Also the learning environment there is quite different to the one in their own country. When I visited the college they were just a few weeks away from the holidays so there were a lot of students but there was little noise in the college. There is no noise for the students studying English and I saw that as a good thing for their study. It is not always easy to study in college because you have to be as quiet as possible. The students who are studying English and have been at Atlantic College say that they have been very interested by the environment and the teaching staff in the school. They said that it was a great experience. Their language study experience at Atlantic College has really improved their English learning and this has made them want to continue studying English at home."
B1," This evening was going to be a blast so we had ordered a drink and were planning how to spend the evening. The activity centre is a busy part of town and there were loads of people there. The bar was already filling up so we settled down to relax and talk. Matt had a group of friends coming and wanted to know if they would like to get drunk on the rooftop bar. The drinks were a little steep but we decided we would give it a shot as there were not a lot of people there. Our favourite bar in the town was booked that night so we decided to wait at the Activity Centre. After we got settled down Matt and I started getting ready to climb. I had never even climbed a rock or climbed anything to my knowledge. In my mind it was going to be very difficult and that I would need plenty of time to master climbing a rock. I had got a few moves in and just went straight to the bar to drink a glass of wine. After about an hour we had climbed some of the highest cliffs in the area and were just about ready to hang. I thought there might be a wall to the end of the cliff and the rest was fairly straightforward. We thought that was when Matt told me how the wall was going to be. It was as high as our skirts! I panicked and looked at him. He was so confident that I felt ashamed. He had climbed the same thing and now he was free so I decided to go back home and prepare for the challenge. I had no idea how to climb a rock. I didn't have my gear on or any clothing. I was just out of breath from climbing the cliffs. I told Matt how badly it felt and we decided to go back up. As we were climbing some of the rocks, I noticed that the cliffs were very rocky and made my back end hurt. We were at around 40 metres up when suddenly a rock fell on us. I didn't see it coming and was just too caught up in being on top of a cliff to think of how bad it was. The..."," We had an hour of free time on Saturday so we decided to try for the cliff-top. The entrance for the trip on a Saturday is at 4 pm. Matt told me he would leave early from his work so we could go and have a drink together as soon as we reached the centre. We decided to go early and get there before anyone else. The entrance was at 4pm, so we could get there first. We walked up to the Activity Centre and found it was pretty empty. After a little bit of tinkering, we managed to climb up the big rock face to the top of the cliff. Before we were done we were already feeling light headed and shaking. The water was freezing cold as the wind was pushing it around, which made it even colder. When it became dark, we turned back down. We were both fairly pleased with the experience."," After we had walked around to get some drinks we entered the large hall for our evening talks. One of the members of staff welcomed us and told us that during the busy times of the day there might be people watching us. I started to smile at the woman and noticed that she was not happy that we were sitting in the group of people watching her. The woman looked annoyed and I did not hear what she said at first. As I watched she got the idea. The woman told us that it was not allowed to stand up near the water. We could only sit in the lower section of the hall and the only place to go was the lower section of the building. She explained to us how much they were charging us for climbing the 30 metres of rock. As we waited we walked around the huge building looking at all the equipment, climbing equipment, scaffolding, ropes... we were looking at everything we could use. After a few minutes she came down the stairs and said hello to us. ""You're going to need something. We're gonna let you climb if you bring your own."" That was all it took for me to go out and buy all the climbing gear I could think of for the activity. When I got back to the group of people watching I smiled and told them all about the woman and how she would not let us watch. I said I was glad she was going to let the others climb but I couldn't believe that I ended up being part of the drama. ""I hope we could have climbed it the same day"" was all I could think about."," We were tired from our day of climbing, walking and cycling, but we were happy nonetheless. We had a drink together and then went upstairs to find a suitable location to hang ourselves. In the lounge a woman was talking to an older man, so Matt went to check on his friend. I went to find a spot of my own. A colleague said, ""There's plenty of space in the lounge but the lift to the first floor isn't working"". There were people waiting. I turned around and a group of people had a big rope on their shoulder ready for us to jump into. They had a guide, but no one to hold onto it. I walked up to a guy with a beard who sat in a chair at the front of the group. He asked me what I wanted to do and told me what to do. He did the same for Matt. I heard Matt get the rope and hang. He had to have had his arm fixed a few years ago or it might have broken. I waited for the group to come together and was glad when they did. It felt like heaven. My friend Matt and I decided that if we wanted to we could hang for a few minutes longer but after we jumped, we had to walk back down to the lounge to climb down again. It was very short-lived, but it was a nice change of pace after the hard climb and was very enjoyable."," It's the best place for climbing in the city, and we were thrilled that we had booked one of the few spaces left for Saturday night. I was so excited, I almost couldn't breathe, and we walked over to our designated climbing spot on the wall above the bar. The walls were made of stone and rock, and we had a view over a cliff to the river. As we prepared to climb I felt my eyes go purring and I tried to concentrate on holding the rope I was used to using. The rock in front of me looked a bit daunting and I felt a bit dizzy. Matt helped me hold on a moment and the feeling left me. I stepped back and peered down the rope to see what I was doing. Just above me, I could see the edge of the cliff, where I would soon be hanging. I felt a bit of excitement, as I stepped down the rope in small, little steps. I reached the bottom, and stared at the stream below. I felt so lucky. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've had, and it changed my life forever. It made me realise how strong I am, and how much I have to go for, and how lucky I am to be at such a place as this."," We were hoping for a quiet, relaxed morning climbing as a hobby, but as it turned out, climbing would get us into trouble. It was the busiest weekend in the year, but everyone at the Activity Centre was busier than ever.

We arrived in the Activity Centre at around 7.50 on Friday evening and I was left with a few minutes to catch up on my work before having to get ready for climbing. Matt and I walked over to the bus station for a ride to the nearest village, at about 8 p.m. After waiting on the bus for a while we decided to walk. We walked through a country lane and eventually came to the Activity Centre parking lot. The Activity Centre was not in view from our walk, and I was a bit taken aback when I arrived. The centre itself was not large or busy. There were just a few people sitting around in chairs in an open area. The people were all talking in conversation. I walked into the open area and there were some more chairs. A man in a suit stood and introduced himself as Andrew. He took the chair I was sitting in, and the two of us started chatting. It was a really nice introduction. Andrew was the leader of the climbing group. Andrew would be the guide for the whole weekend, but before climbing started I would have to pass some information along to him.

Andrew said that the weather wasn't bad, as I already knew from reading the weather forecasts. There was a wind chill of about 40 degrees, but it wasn't cold or wet. It was a nice day with no clouds or heavy rain and no risk of rain in the forecast. He then asked if I had anything I wanted to pack. I had..."," We signed up for the two day beginner climbing course. I was happy. We had booked a cabin for the first night. After signing up, we were given our equipment bags and a first aid kit and we headed off to the Activity Centre. I grabbed Matt's handbag and grabbed a box of food. We were at the bottom of the hallway and we were immediately greeted by the Activity Centre staff. After we signed up, the staff said we would be in with the rest of the group and we got separated into our own area. My friend and I were given the first aid kit and the box of food. The Activity Centre staff were helpful and explained to us the course and what to expect. This is what the Course is all about: Rock climbing over thirty metres, starting on Saturday afternoon and finishing on the Sunday morning. Before the climb we were given a test to see how high we were already and how much climbing we were able to do. After the test the staff asked me to say how far I was going to climb. I said 30 metres and they looked puzzled. I thought I was making a joke but I was serious when I said 30 metres. They thought I was kidding and laughed, thinking it was an inept joke. Finally they agreed that I was serious and they prepared me for the climb. It took a lot of rope so I was told to prepare with a bar and not just with a carabiner like I had done on the first few days. I climbed up the rope slowly. We were allowed to do some loose rope first. A lot of it was really loose and I was nervous. We made it to the top and all of a sudden I was very excited! The weather was really good and we went for a..."
B1," I'm now in your hands so thank you very much. The recipient is Mr H. B. I was at the bus stop when my handbag dropped onto the ground. I left the address book in the bag. I had about £50 in cash in the purse. When I realised what I had done, too late, I couldn't find my way home or phone the police to help. I had been gone for a long time. I couldn't help myself: I panicked. It seems that no one has seen my bag. I don't know where I live. I'm 72 years old, I am a long way from home. What should I do?"," It was a very lonely afternoon. My daughter-in-law, her husband and I all had been to our friend's house in the afternoon. He had gone to the seaside for a rest so that evening was very quiet. The last of us came home about half past seven. At home in the evening we ate a very good roast dinner. My daughter-in-law put the bill on the table. I went down to the toilet and looked at the address book and suddenly realised that it was a mistake. You know, when you live alone all the time you are very apt to make mistakes. You always write it by accident. Then I started to run. As I ran I heard a voice say ""there must be something on the bus."" Well, of course I was right. As I walked past the bus stop I saw a man walking towards the bus with his hand in his pocket. He seemed to be carrying a bundle. He said to the bus driver, ""Excuse me, but I have a bag. It is very heavy. Can I sit here?"" Well I am very sorry to say that in this age of technology, when everybody carries a cell phone, you can be sure the bag was heavy. The bus driver said ""oh, yes, it is. But you can't take it on the bus."" No I said, why not? The bus driver said ""well, I won't sit in it. That is not allowed."" And so it started all over again. The bus driver put up his umbrella and got in and took me on. So you can imagine how I got home."," I had a mobile phone but when I called home I had trouble getting through. I phoned my brother and when I made the call I was told he had gone into the shop to buy some vegetables. I could hear him call. I hung up and left the message ""I wish you were home for us,"" to let you know how I was feeling. I did not make it home but I was thinking of you and how much I enjoyed my visit to your school. I can't believe how quickly your school has changed. I met your Principal Mr. Heaney and he seemed to know me very well. He even asked what I liked most about Newport. I am very pleased to say that the bus has come back and we are all happy to see you again."," I was in a hurry and it was hard to see what to do, but when I reached home I made a phone call to the police station for help."," I didn't have much money left but I could not take everything with me on the bus so I had to decide whether to buy a ride on the bus or to call a taxi. The bus was late so I decided to call a taxi. I was driving away with the money in my pocket when suddenly a car turned the corner and crashed into the bus. When I saw this I screamed for help, the driver swerved to avoid the accident, but in the end the car spun about and fell in the ditch. The wheel came out of the driver's body, which was left with a serious injury. When I heard this I was shocked and upset. My friend on the bus asked what had happened and when I told her the news she ran and called the police. When I arrived at the police station I was told the car driver had taken a large amount of money and run away. I thought that was the end of the story, but the police told me that the driver of the car who hit the bus was not the one who had run away. He had been drunk and lost control of his car. The driver of the car, whom the police were trying to find, was in fact a police officer named Stephen Fry. He was being investigated for negligence and was now in jail. He was also the father of a friend of mine. He was caught by mistake, but he was trying to put up with the situation. I felt very sorry for Stephen. Now I understand why my friend was upset when she heard the news. The accident was caused by the drunk driver, who was drunk, not the bus driver. The bus driver was responsible for everything, but because of his drunkenness, he had run away."," After a good many tries to recover my documents I went to the office in an empty hall and started to write a letter. It was only when I was in the car and writing the next page that I realised that I would never finish. So instead of a letter, here is a handwritten page. F K Grades are not correct for this type of writing. Handwritten Page"," The bus driver found the ticket and paid it to me. The bus conductor left me and I thought I was going to walk to my local bus stop, but then I realised that I must have left my handbag at the bus stop. When I found it in the bus I was quite confused, because it had not happened yet. The first stop was at the local bus stop, but when I got on to the bus, I realised it had stopped on a bridge over a narrow river. There was only one place to sit and that place was taken by another bus. The bus driver didn't think the place he had occupied would have been taken and I had to sit. As there were no more places left, I had to sit with two other men. The bus driver called the conductor and they informed the other bus driver, but there were too many people on the bus to find another place. The driver had to make the bus move, but when he got to the bridge the bus was too late to cross it and had to go back. I had to wait at the bus stop for about three hours. At that moment the lady at the bus stop gave me a ticket and a number to pay it with. When I got home I had to pay the..."
B1, In some ways the report from Dave Worthington Homestyle is almost a story in itself. The news also has a funny touch as it follows the story of a young lady who had a nasty fall on a furniture store shelf at a shopping centre after she dropped the sofa down. At the time it was reported that the company had put in place a new security system after the fall. The sad news was followed by an entertaining story that revealed the young lady had actually bought the sofa from an antique shop. As a result the store shut down the following night as well as the sofa which cost about $500 (£325). As the story unfolds it becomes clear what the young lady did. Worthington Homestyle had a security system after the fall but not before. After she dropped the sofa down the young lady bought the sofa at an antique shop, Other special offers included an upholstered bed for £20 (but only between 8 am and 3 am). There were lots of sales as well.," They made their first purchase there, and were immediately met with disappointment. There were too many people. The shop closed at 8am.

The shop, Dave Worthington Homestyle, was in a quiet residential area in Northampton and was shut due to capacity issues. The shop owners told me that they had received a number of complaints about the shopping frenzy that occurred there. The shop was too crowded to work, and their number of customers exceeded their ability to handle all the sales.", The company announced the decision to close after running out of furniture in the course of one day. The opening at midnight was a big success for the shop. The opening did take more than one day to run out of furniture.," But there was no way for the people who were trying to shop to make sure they had the time for all the offers. Many people had left their job and were now working and they needed to move furniture as soon as possible. People were able to book moving services for up to £50 (but the best deal for a bedroom was £20). The people were waiting in queues for up to 5 hours to make sure their furniture had arrived in their new home. But now it is clear that there were just not enough moving trucks and there had to be a decision to close the shop, or wait until tomorrow to receive the furniture. The store closed at 10pm after many hours of running and after the shops had been left without money for the hours they had spent."," They were happy to spend their time though.

B1," But it is these biological and natural habitats that have won Eden project award after award. It is the only conservation project in the world receiving a Gold Medal at both the Bird and The Ecological Society of America (ESA). The Eden Project is at the centre of a debate over whether nature must be replaced with urban landscaping. The Eden Project has received numerous awards and prizes from around the world. But they aren’t necessarily for its buildings or natural habitat, many of which are considered the best in the world. Instead what is often noted are the numerous awards the project has received for its environmental restoration work. Since its opening in 2000 the Eden Project has grown to become a major attraction with more than 200,000 visitors. There are more than 40 different areas for you to explore and explore. While the project is often described as having an ‘authentic’ feel it is not strictly natural or organic. The vast majority of the buildings in the Eden Project are all made out of different types of locally sourced materials and recycled wood. One of the buildings that has received special recognition is The Flower Garden. This is an impressive garden built out of local recycled wood from the gardens around London. You can also visit The Wetland Centre, which houses the famous Saltmarsh Reserve, or just relax on one of the numerous benches in the gardens."," What will be the first impression visitors receive at the Eden Project? What are the ‘biospheres’ similar to? Answer not in context



The Eden Project Since it opened the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK’s most popular tourist attractions. At first sight the huge ‘biospheres’ on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie.", The large public gardens and swimming pool are a haven of peace and beauty which the whole family can enjoy. It is the ideal place to learn about natural habitats and why plants thrive in the wild. What makes the Eden Project so special is the fact that it is an independent project run entirely by voluntary workers.," At their most primitive they look just like a huge puddle of mud and dirt.  As visitors wander about, it is easy to understand why the Eden Project is a big tourist attraction. The beauty of their plants, animals, and wildlife is overwhelming. It seems unlikely that visitors would ever tire of the spectacle of these huge structures. To those who do not know what a biosphere is, there are a few hints. A biosphere is a permanent, self-perpetuating habitat, the permanent residence of a plant or animal species. These are the types of plants and animals which live in situ. A biosphere can be quite large, and it will often be surrounded by more permanent structures that allow visitors to explore them.  This is one of the areas which is not to be missed by visitors to the Eden Project. It is always worthwhile to walk in the middle of the biosphere and explore it on foot or by bike. Although there are many of them, the one which is best known is ‘Rainforest’. This is the most impressive of all. You can admire the giant trees that grow on the edge of the biosphere as well as the trees of the original tree-covered site. The Rainforest, is one of the most popular areas in the Eden Project and is always a long line of visitors waiting for admittance. The Garden of Earth, another of the best known is a small and unadorned garden which has many features of an indigenous garden, such as the indigenous flowering plants. The most famous and the...", In many areas it is possible to plant your own trees. Many people visit the Eden Project to learn about ecology. What do you need to know before you go?, The biodiversity of the plants and animals that live in these ecosystems is astonishing - and they are growing more and more. But as a huge and expensive site visitors still must pay to visit it. For visitors who are lucky enough to live close to the Eden Project they will be able to experience first-hand all these fascinating facts and learn more about the conservation work that is being done in one of the world's greatest green projects. To meet the demand for more tourists the site's managers decided to open a new wing called the Eden Project at a much more reasonable price. The new wing was opened in 1993. How do you find this story," It offers visitors the chance to see many different species of animals and plants at close-range and learn about their habitat. Visitors are also given a wide selection of plants which they can look at, photograph and take home with them."

B1," What did he do The early explorer was a pioneer. He was brave, determined and risked his life for the discovery of the best natural harbour on the world. For the early Spanish explorer to do this he crossed the dangerous San Francisco Bay, went through the rough land, and was determined to explore the world around him. For some reason the coast around San Francisco was not a destination that many Europeans liked. The Spanish explorer was determined to get to the coast and explore it."," When a ship docked near San Francisco, some men on shore asked the crew whether the ship was on the coast or in the Bay. The ship's captain, however, was convinced it was on the Bay, and ordered all the people to be on board. The ship's officers and crew then removed the passengers and luggage from the ship and towed it out of the Bay by the crane. This is known as the 'Safety of Bay.' Other natural harbours are on the west coast near Honolulu and the northeast coast near Vancouver. San Francisco is a city and a county located in California. The city is famous for its waterfront view, its beaches and the area around Golden Gate Park and Fisherman's wharf. It is also popular for its museums and history museums. The area around San Francisco is also home to many different kinds of organisms. The bay is a good place to see whales and dolphins and you can also watch seals and other sea life at San Francisco Bay Aquarium. The famous Golden Gate Park includes the highest point in the area with its elevation of 833 feet above sea level. A park that is open to the public in San Francisco's downtown area is the Golden Gate Park. San Francisco has many beaches which includes North Beach, Venice Beach, Beachwood Beach, Fisherman's wharf, and Marina District.", The first explorers to walk the coastline from the mainland were given this beautiful land mass as a gift. They were given land in the form of islands in San Francisco Bay. When the land masses were discovered the local population of the fishermen of San Francisco Bay got involved. They dug holes to protect their homes from the incoming waves.," The first settlement was at what is now the area of East Bay, a small peninsula jutting into the San Francisco Bay. The bay was named for the ship that sailed in the area before the area was settled. Portola's first settlement was on the East Bay peninsula. In fact the name of San Francisco was a metaphor for this settlement. Portola, as Spanish explorer, took this first settlement to be the beginning of new life. He left his name, along with his ship, as a name for San Francisco Bay as well as East Bay. The peninsula, which is now the site of the San Francisco Bay area, was called East Bay peninsula because of the fact it was a small peninsula that jutted into the San Francisco Bay, rather than into open ocean. It is important to note that even though there is a little San Francisco Bay there is no ocean in the area; it is the San Francisco Bay and East Bay peninsula. The island in the area is called Alcatraz Island, and it was the name of a place Portola thought might be a harbor for the San Francisco Bay area. There are three main reasons for the name of San Francisco. It is a city which is located in the area, the area is named for something that Portola saw and took the name, and it is a Bay named after a ship.", The land was then filled in with houses and businesses as the population grew. The first port on the shores of San Francisco Bay was the Bimini Ferry which was built in 1796. It was a big wooden boat which took people to and from the Bimini Islands. It is now a historic site and is a landmark. San Francisco San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour it was discovered by land rather than by sea. The land was then filled in with houses and businesses as the population grew. The first port on the shores of San Francisco Bay was the Bimini Ferry which was built in 1796. It was a big wooden boat which took people to and from the Bimini Islands. It is now a historic site and is a landmark. The Bimini Ferry was a great historic site," Its name translates to 'seaplace'. It was called San Francisco Bay because its population was very high and it was easy for the European explorers and traders to move around the bay. It took European explorers and traders over 400 years to come to a conclusion that San Francisco Bay in the south-western San Francisco is actually a natural bay. After four years the San Francisco region was annexed by the United States of America. The population rose by 50%. In 1860 a city was founded and in 1880 the first railroad reached the city. The City of San Francisco Today San Francisco has an estimated population of 9.7 million. San Francisco Bay San Francisco Bay is a famous coastal bay in the north-western part of San Francisco, California. The Bay was first called San Francisco Bay because its population was very high and it was easy for European explorers and traders to move around the bay. It took 400 years to come to a conclusion that San Francisco Bay in the south-western San Francisco is actually a natural bay. It is very large and has almost 2000 islands. The San Francisco Bay area is home to San Francisco, San Mateo, and the surrounding county's counties and cities. San Francisco Bay San Francisco Bay", Portola found San Francisco at the western end of the San Francisco Peninsula. Portola is now the place called Portola Valley. Portola Valley is a valley located north of San Francisco. How was the area discovered By land

The Flesch-Kincaid Grades Scale The Flesch-Kincaid Grades Scale is an important tool for making decisions about a text's difficulty (readability). This test, which takes advantage of linguistic markers such as spelling, reading, and vocabulary, helps evaluate how well someone can read and understand texts which are written in a number of languages. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale was designed to provide readers with a measure of their level of ability in reading and understanding various kinds of written materials. The Flesch-Kincaid Grades Scale is not a grade based on school subjects or tests. It is a tool for making decisions about a text's difficulty (readability). The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale was designed to provide readers with a measure of their level of ability in reading and understanding various kinds of written materials.

Caroline Benson, 22, who played Anna in The Hands of You, talks about her first TV role at the BBC3 anthology, The Invisible Family, and how it was to spend the film with her family in Northumberland", I never thought my first week would be anything but like school. But it's been a very different experience.' The Finnegans is a young people’s book set in the 1920s. It won the Caldecott Medal for young readers. Caroline is interested in this book as it is set in the 1920s. 'It’s one of those books that has such a strong sense of place and at the same time you have the magic of those years - I feel transported through a time that is so rich and important to our culture. I love the book and it is something I would treasure and pass down to the next generation.' Caroline went to her first university filming session on a Friday afternoon.

B1," My parents were the first to try and teach me about the topic. When I went to primary school, we used plastic bags in the supermarket, and my parents taught me about what to do with them after I picked them up and put them in the bin. My mother once asked me if my mum could borrow a pair of clothes to make me look better in them. She was so embarrassed that I was out when I arrived home, and she told me that she was ashamed of me. I didn't believe her. You don't really think that your mum would ask someone to borrow a couple of clothing, because the clothes didn't fit. Instead, it's because she wants to dress you better. In my high school years, I could fit into whatever I wore because I used to weigh a ton. And I never wore a pair of clothes that were just not good for me. Instead, I went with the trend. I went to university and started to diet, and went on to live by the clean eating diet. I spent all my money on that. I lost 90kg in a year, and I got into shape and got rid of the extra fat around my midsection. But what I didn't do is give up drinking wine. In high school, I started to drink it, and then I made it a lifestyle. Over the past year, I've been trying to give up drinking wine. It's not something I was interested in before because I didn't think it was really bad. But I started to drink a lot of it, and after it was too much, I began to have a lot of other drinks, like a whole bottle of beer at bed time. This is when I started to live more ethically. I want to go back to the clean eating diet, and the wine has just taken over. I didn't live that way before, but I have to go back to that because my body is not the same, and when I'm on my clean eating diet, I don't want to be put through that. That's the..."," I did it for the camera. The story - that was written by one of the BBC's most well-known journalists - was actually about my father. This isn't about my dad but about how this new title is not the title for someone who wants to live ethically. It has to be a title for someone who is looking for a difference and changes their lifestyle as they go. I feel the new title should be the BBC's 'Man of the People'. In fact the word Man in the People is now the one that comes first in the title for my role. Here you can read the entire entry from 'BBC's Ethical Man' - the story was written by Nick Knowles.
You can find out more about how I became the BBC's Ethical Man at my blog at"," I'm here because I genuinely want to do it. I'm an aspiring journalist and I know that living ethically doesn't always mean living by the code of the Code of Practice for Journalists. But I also know that for many of us it means being kind to animals, supporting those less fortunate and donating to charity. But it's not just these things. I would like to see people living more ethically but it's really not something that you can easily achieve. How do you have ethics in your life? It's important to know what's right and what's wrong, and to be willing to learn. I'm an aspiring journalist and I know that living ethically doesn't always mean living by the code of the Code of Practice for Journalists. But I also know that for many of us it means being kind to animals, supporting those less fortunate and donating to charity. In this week’s weekly letter to our students, Justin is providing some key tips for living more ethically."," I was chosen as a presenter by the BBC but I never felt I could write a report and explain why I think life is cruel if I did not have to. And I did not feel I could raise the issue as the BBC would take me out of their programme and be less inclined to discuss ethics with me. But when I was presented with the opportunity, I felt I could take this on, because I feel passionate about it and it was something I am proud to be doing. Well, it has not been easy. A big part of this whole life is trying to be the best, so when people asked me why I wanted to be the BBC's Ethical Man, they thought I was being petty and selfish. But this year has been hard for me in that sense. There has been a lot of personal stuff about me going on and people have not supported it. I haven't received all the sympathy I need, and in the past I felt like I was the only one in the world who was struggling. It is a tough situation. It means I feel like I am out in a place with lots of strangers and I don't know what to say. It is something that has made me question whether I am living my life any more. I now have to face my truth and decide what I want for myself - to be selfish or not? But I think I have always felt myself as someone who believes in ethics because it has always been a huge part of my life. Now I must decide if I want to have a career with ethics as well, so I have two choices to make. I have to decide whether I want to be the good guy or the bad guy. I am a difficult guy to judge, but sometimes I feel like I am going to do what is right - even if it means breaking rules. And the other thing is to decide what do I want - do I want a big ego? A big...", It was given to me by the BBC Trust. I have just started my second year and my first task is to teach CEFR to people in my region. This is a language that most of my local friends only speak in English. It is important for me to tell my own version of what it means to be an 'ethical man' - to live in an ethical and friendly way., It's the story of a man trying to learn more about the world that is happening in our lives. The story is a good one though. It's from a man who wants to understand something that is happening in his world. It also shows that people should be able to decide how they want to live and why they want to live.," It was a generous proposal by a lovely journalist who saw a big gap in the market. In the coming weeks we will be interviewing someone who makes a difference. In this article she will tell us about a charity that supports communities to improve their life by using what is known as 'Community-Based Participation' - a process in which different people, groups and organisations work together on challenging the current system."

B1," The town attracted many people and became a thriving trading community. People from all over the US came to Iditarod to trade in gold and silver. Iditarod became a huge tourist attraction and the residents of the town could live off the gold and silver the visitors brought in. Iditarod's population grew so much that the land became overcrowded. Iditarod had so many people that it became the home of the largest population of bears in the world. But not everyone was happy about this, one bear cub had become spoiled and decided to rule the world. Iditarod became known for its bears, but now it was time for the next great race: a human race."," The town was founded by a group of French explorers, and was one of the most important tourist destinations in the area. Over time, a small group of people in the town moved east on a long road, and eventually reached the North Pole. This group of explorers named the first group of explorers the Iditarod and took their name from the trail they made. The first explorers made their way east across the landscape, and the second group of explorers followed them. Eventually they met an enormous frozen lake, which they thought was in their way. They pulled on a piece of rock and were overcome. The rock split from the top, and let go of them. This rock then split into hundreds of pieces. They were then thrown far far away. This rock then became what is now the highest peak of the Rocky Mountains, Mount McKinley. From that moment on, the region where the two groups met became known as Alaska."," There are many roads leading to Iditarod. The roads have names like The Big Wagon, The White Cannon and The Big Wheel. Iditarod is an annual event. Every year thousands of people take part in the races in Iditarod. They are a family event that is fun for everyone involved. The races are held on the last weekend in October. One of the things that makes Iditarod unique is that the races are held on a frozen lake. They are held in the North Pole. The last time Iditarod was held on a frozen lake was in 1890. This made Iditarod unique. The first race in Iditarod is run on the last Saturday of September. As soon as everyone has arrived, they head towards the ice in the big tent, called the North Pole House. It is called The North Pole, because it is on the North Pole of Earth. There are competitors on a sled team who run around the lake. It is fun to see the sleds speed across the lake. There are competitors who are sledding in two teams - sledding with a partner and sledding with just one person. As the race is won, the team with a partner gets all of the sweets, including chocolate and peanut butter, on the way to the finish line. There are lots of spectators as well. The races last between four and five hours. There are a number of races per day on the last weekend of October. It is a very busy event that is filled with lots of excitement."," There the people lived in the woods on the northern edge of the US. They were not quite the same as the people on the southern edge of the US, but they lived their life just as they did for thousands of years. In the 1880s, one man by the name of David was a man of a different sort. He was an adventurer. He wanted to be rich too. He found gold all over the American continent. He was going to do something bold, something daring, something that was going to make his name. The people in Iditarod were tired of gold as their main source of wealth. They looked to go to the new world that had been discovered. They began to gather and started preparations for the next great race. They planned to build great towns and build roads to help move goods to and from the new world. They hoped that the next time they would be richer than ever before. One by one they built houses for themselves in the towns. Their towns grew bigger and bigger. They built towns far from each other so that the goods and people would not get caught in any traffic jams. The people went to work every day and worked hard. They did what they could. All of this was happening in Iditarod."," A race was held every year in the middle of the summer that involved about 200 riders going from town to town all looking for gold. The riders were all dressed in bright red robes and a white scarf over their heads, riding donkeys. The race was held every few months until gold wasn't found. The winner of the race, who was in fact a government official who had been sent from Europe to get the treasure, was awarded the prize. Then they were thrown to the mob when they came to town. THE GOLD LURE - ALASKA In the 1850s the first lure to attract gold to a new area was introduced in Alaskan. It was a device made from flints and copper which was dropped from a helicopter and would bring the miners a piece of gold every time it was dropped. The prize for the first lure was given to the government official who dropped it into the river. As the area started to develop, miners began building large mines around the gold lure. This caused a massive influx of miners to the area. However, the towns were being forced to build more roads into the mines, forcing the people to leave the towns. Today, the mines are surrounded by the town. The last great race - The Iditarod - The Last Great Race On Earth The Iditarod is a race of the same kind of competition as a polo match, with donkeys instead of horses. The riders wear a bright red robe, a white scarf and are accompanied by a crew of about a dozen men, all dressed in bright red. The race is held every few months in mid-summer. The prize is a gold crown, and the winner is given a gold necklace, a necklace of bright red rubies, and a silver ring. The crowd of about 800 people watch the race from a large stage, and the crowd of about 300 people is divided into two teams who compete. The teams have to go from town to town, collecting rubies...", The town was founded in 1880. It became popular because of a race. The last major race took place in 1888. It was the race that started the name of the town and the history. The last large group of the tribe came from a place called Thakkududud. People came to Iditarod to compete in the Iditarod. The race was called Thakkududud.

Each morning they drove their horses to and from the nearest town and then worked on their horses in Iditarod's famous farm. Most of them lived and worked in one small room with wooden floors and no other possessions than a large wooden bed. Each family had to own at least a horse. Eventually the horses became so fat that they could not get up from their stalls, so some of the people worked in Iditarod's mill in the nearby mountains. However, there were also very poor people who lived in the area who did not have access to horses, so they tended to work on their own. The rich people loved Iditarod because the horses did their work for them and they got a nice, warm bed on the winter nights. At one point Iditarod was the second largest industry in the US with thousands of people working there. One of the richest people there was a certain Mr. Denninger. He wanted to build a railroad from the valley to another high point in Iditarod, so he bought the land from the local landowner. In the years that followed, everyone started to build their homes on the land where Mr. Denninger had bought. Finally, Mr. Denninger built a bridge over the creek that runs through the valley so his railroad could run along the lake, which is now known as Lake Iditarod. Iditarod's life became much more crowded after Mr. Denninger built the railroad. At that time, all the animals came from Alaska and lived together in the valleys.

The city’s water pipes are designed to withstand the occasional flood but at the same time they can’t handle the frequent floods. In Marrakesh the water pipes do not have enough pipes to manage all the water, but they do have a large number of underground pipes. They work well for the purpose. But over the last twenty years the rate at which water is pumped from the ground to the pipes has increased so much that the pipes have to be expanded. It has added new pipes and made new pipes unnecessary so the amount of water in the pipes decreases. Since then, many of the pipes have burst as they were expanded too far. In Marrakesh people like watering the desert regularly in their gardens in their front yards. The water from the pipes can only be used to water gardens in their yards. They have to turn it up to a pump before using it. The people who work for the city are very worried about the water they have.

B2, The board is their home. It's been theirs for four years now. In this game they used to play every night after dinner with friends. Norm played the game and the board was the prize for him.," On the board is an assortment of colorful creatures made of plastic such as dogs, cats, fish, penguins, chickens and fish. They take turns going around the board in circles until one of the children is left with only one piece to play. Norm goes over to a stack of small plastic boxes in his office and pulls out 10 boxes, each one containing ten plastic creatures in boxes, to play against the brothers. Norm is making a big hit in the business and even has a date this evening with a lady named Lorna."," They are playing, in their native language, which I am guessing is Spanish, with their two children, Charlie and Charlie's girlfriend, Jane. The game is simple; it is a board game called Bingo. They had been playing it all their lives and had become experts on its rules and how to perform the various moves required. The board is full of the squares of a standard Bingo card. There is a row of six squares in the centre, starting at the upper right-hand corner, all of the same colour. There are six horizontal lines and three vertical ones. They are all the same length. The game starts with a letter or a number in the centre of the board, starting in the upper right-hand corner. Each turn, one of the brothers picks up a Bingo card from the row, and turns the corner towards the player (the player in turn). As they do so, a number is drawn from the board. The player who gets a number matching the number on the card wins a point (each point is worth three squares of bingo). At the end of the turn, the board is cleaned up, and the players take turns again. One of them now goes to work and produces a new Bingo card. The game continues. As they are trying to remember the rules, they talk about how they used to play this game with their childhood friends, and how their friend George lost his game in front of them. They tell their children about how they remember these details perfectly. They talk about how they were forced out of the game because one of their children wanted to play with the children of a neighbor. They talk about how the two of them were trying to get their children and grandchildren to play the game to keep their house afloat. In the early times of the game, the game was used for the purpose of buying homes. The two brothers' childhood game with their friends took place on their children's birthday. The game is also sold at specialised clubs which they also buy from. One of the brothers says that their game started as a game of Bingo but has gone on to become more and more complicated, to the point where it is no longer known what...", Dave and Norm find the game of tic tac toe to be a perfect investment. They buy the game and invest the money to buy a better piece of equipment.," The board lies beneath a wooden frame and the two brothers are playing a game that many people have forgotten is even a legal game in United States. The board is shaped as a cube, and it is surrounded by four identical rectangular pieces with identical coloured borders. It is this board that is of crucial importance to the brothers. Norm begins by explaining how this board was made, the importance of the colouring of the pieces to the game and their own interest in playing the game with their younger brother, Dave. Norm explains that this board was made for them. A young man who lives down the street from them bought it for them. A man, named Dave, a salesman for a radio station that was once Dave's brother's favourite hangout. When Norm was a child, he and Dave always played this game together. Norm explains that this board was the one that helped to put the two brothers on top of the game. What is especially appealing about their childhood game is that it never got out of their heads since the boys were still very young. Norm began to play the game in his youth and it has not been lost on him. Norm explains to his brother how many plays they could now play and how much the board cost. Norm also asks his brother to count how many times he has won against his brother. Norm tells his brother how he won the game against Dave for thousands of times when they were children. The two brothers sit in silence for a while, then Norm looks around the home and looks over to see if there is anything else they could be doing, before leaving to make the next play. The family is very much like other families in America, with two sons, two daughters and one grandchild living in the house."," Over them a television set that is playing an old flick  On Into the Great Outdoors. They are looking at the toy. Then Dave grabs the board on which he sees something he believes is his uncle's map of the United States. The brothers look at it in surprise. Norm decides it is worth a try to find the map. Norm takes a long time finding a piece. They begin to have their doubts and look in the nearby closet to try to find some change. Norm, the brother who is smarter, is quite anxious to do a quick little test to find out what the game is and what the family has in store for them. Norm decides he doesn't care about a quick test, He decides that he'll just see what happens in the movie. When he discovers that a little plastic map has been turned into an old map of the United States he thinks at first he has found his uncle's map. Then he realizes that the uncle had a different name, Norm's uncle, and that he has been replaced with a guy named Jerry. Norm decides it's a good sign.He leaves the board and heads toward the kitchen, He opens the fridge, takes out a box of plastic pieces, and throws the box onto the table. The brothers begin playing, And in a few minutes they are winning. No parents will ever know"," Norm and Dave are playing a round-robin game called On-To-a-Winner. It was introduced to them as a childhood game by their mother. Norm's older brother Bill is a big fan, watching his brother play, Norm is sure they will soon be big business, if they keep on playing. The game is simple enough: The players move two identical ping-pong balls in opposite directions across the board and the brother with the fastest two balls gets to keep the board in his possession.  The board can be easily made of a piece of cardboard on which the two balls are stuck in opposite directions, or it can be made of plywood covered in cardboard. Norm's mother bought two small plastic ping-pong balls. The boys are in a position to begin. When they begin to move, the board is taken from them and put back with the new balls. The rules remain the same: Norm can't shoot the balls, because he must shoot the balls from the sides or else he will lose them. The brothers must move two identical ping-pong balls in opposite directions across the board. A player with the fastest two balls is to be the winner."

She put her head between the knob and the keyhole of the door and said, ""Good morning, Doctor Kemp. Are you there?""  Dr Kemp was wondering what would happen now when the old lady knocked again. Dr Kemp knew that someone was waiting for him when his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships' lights shone.

The old lady must have been leaving or she would have left with him. He looked around at his desk again. He noticed the little girl's chair was missing. Then he looked at his notebook. It was not in his desk. He knew that something was not quite right. He called the little girl to him and said, ""Excuse me, little girl. Do you know where your chair is?""

B2," A group of scientists in France say the Mont Bego rock art is endangered as a result of tourists carving into the rock art and not enough protecting to the mountain. The Mont Bego rocks are located north of the French city of Grenoble in the French Alps and are home to the oldest surviving rock art in the country. The mountains have been used by humans for thousands of years and the rock art reflects the world around it. Scientists in Grenoble, France say tourists carving into the rock art is leading to its destruction (Picture: Getty Images) A French government spokesman said there is little money to protect the rock art. But it did say that there has never been any evidence that the ancient rock art had been destroyed or eroded by tourists in the last thousand years."," The damage is so serious that scientists are calling it ""cataclysmic""
The artist who was responsible for the rock art is not willing to turn over the drawings. Scientists warn that the drawings are at risk because they are in caves underground. Scientists say that the drawings are worth the risk. Scientists are worried about the drawings because they are underground."," These are just a few of the many dangers facing France's most important tourist sites. Scientists believe that the drawings might be damaged at any moment.

The pictures that are under threat of getting destroyed have been carved into the rock for thousands of years.   Some scientists have described the ancient rock art as the most complex art ever created. The drawings contain very detailed representations of animal and human beings.   These artists have attempted to depict important messages.   They have been painted thousands of times.  

What may be the greatest danger of the drawings being destroyed? They are difficult to reproduce and repair if lost."," The rock art was created by a mysterious group of artists whose last known works are about 5000 years old. Most of the art is done with red ochre paint, the color of the volcanic rock that makes up the Mont Bego's landscape. Scientists believe that the caretakers of the Mont Bego have been altering their colors with water and lime, the color of the soil, over the years so that the colors in the artwork will match their current colors. The Mont Bego artwork may have been created by the same people as the famous cave art from Lascaux. The first layer of paint was destroyed in August 2010. A similar problem with this rock art found in the region of Lascaux was discovered in 2001 by a team of French researchers who examined the paintings in the cave. They then made a discovery that has shocked the world of art: a layer of paint found in the caves of Lascaux has similar colors to the rock art from Mont Bego. What will be the result of altering the color of the paint?"," They think that this has caused a sudden decline in the population of the birds that feed on them and therefore that they risk being lost as well. Some of the pictures show people (like a family) and are believed to have been carved at around 3200 years ago. Areas of rock where the paintings are found are also rich in fossil bones, wood and animal bones. These findings are part of a new study in which a team of researchers from the University of Grenoble have been examining the pictures . [line 6: beginning]
It would be great to show pictures of the pictures and their discovery to students at your school. They would appreciate it if you could provide the following information to the students:

The pictures were carved into the rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps
The study of the pictures started in the 1990s
The team of researchers came across more than 1000 old pictures in the area They are carved into the rocks and have been there since before humans came to life
Many of the images feature people, animals and the landscape around them.", Scientists and researchers fear that the French Alps may also be lost to tourism. Tourists often damage Alpine rock paintings. Thousands of pictures slowly disappear due to tourists' carelessness in the French Alps., The French Alps can be described as the birthplace of art. Artist and artist's work can be found in every village. French artists can use a wide variety of painting techniques and media to create works which are internationally recognised by art experts. France's rich cultural heritage and its artistic reputation are reflected in France's diverse history. The Mont Bego site has been listed on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites.

B2," - The Dublin News On a Saturday afternoon in November 2014, after a long and difficult day at work, I felt like I was going to the brink of another nervous breakdown. I had been offered a six-year contract working for a large company in Dublin and had agreed it for at least two years. After a while, I decided to give it a try. And in that very moment, I knew what I was doing. The idea of leaving a place where I worked for such a long time had already driven me mad. The only problem was that I hadn't been offered any compensation. However, on Saturday afternoon, my wife and I went to a home that was advertised for sale by someone who knew someone who had just left. After a short conversation, we knew that there was a lot of traffic in this small, isolated part of town and knew that there were no lifts in the area. I walked through the house and found that it had been left behind by people who were moving on from Dublin. The landlord didn't know if it was being sold or occupied at the time of the interview, but he said that there were two bedrooms and one bathroom. It felt like the perfect home for me. However, it did have one big problem. The landlord never paid us rent for our apartment even once. He had been in Dublin for a few months only, so he was still working with my family, but was still paying rent. He would call the landlord and pay out the rent himself. I explained this to the landlord and he apologized to me. I had expected something more from him, because I really wanted to leave that place. However, after all of this time, he wouldn't ever forgive me. He would pay us rent in January of the following year, but the rent had to be paid for a few weeks. For the landlord, he never gave up. He didn't give up until I was at my job for a year and was renting one of the flats. I had to pay him back in installments, which was very difficult to do because of my job. I would still have had my job, but I didn't have enough money to live in the place I wanted. I had to..."," So you made arrangements, tried to meet your new homeowners, and waited.

B2," There are a few things you can do to get yourself prepared to make a strong first impression, the first thing to do is to become the person you want to be for yourself. Dress to impress Make sure you don't come to the interview dressed down or sloppy. Try to wear a dress shirt and a nice pair of trousers but keep your wardrobe simple. You can also wear a nice blouse if you like. This will make you look approachable and will make people want to talk to you. If you wear a dress, make sure the dress is clean and pressed and is not covered in dust. You don't want to cause a bad first impression and then be asked to pull it off. Make sure all your hair is neatly brushed, if possible, and styled. If it's natural, then make sure the hairstyle is neat and clean and you don't have any lice or fly. You don't want to cause people to judge you based on your appearance. Smile while you are answering any questions you are asked and be as approachable as possible. If you don't smile and look approachable, people will think you don't want to be a part of the interview and they will not want to talk with you. If they want to talk to you, they will."," Interacting with strangers in front of the mirror is recommended first so the potential stranger won't be too nervous and too focused on their own appearance. Be sure to take note of this when you are preparing for the interview. Dress comfortably in a suit or nice clothes for the interview. The look and smell of your own personal belongings can make you look even more nervous and more self-conscious about your appearance.  To help you make your interview room look more relaxed, turn off any other electronics that might distract or interrupt your interview. Ask a friend, family member, or colleague to turn off the TV, radio or computer so you don't have to worry about these distractions. Talk to an experienced interviewer or consultant to find the best way to conduct this part of the interview.", Do you know your first impressions? The... The point is to find a new job . The story goes on to state that having a good first impression makes a huge difference in how well you will succeed in a job.  The interviewers will ask you to show them your first impressions.," It is important to make good... and lasting impressions. The first impression is often the most lasting. Read over the following tips and tips for making good impressions. Make it into a letter, a short speech, a poem, a poem, a book, etc."," Your interviewer will read these first impressions and decide whether or not to accept you for the job. Dress for success. If you don’t wear nice clothes, it’s unlikely you’ll be considered. Keep professional in your appearance to look nice and respectable. Make sure that you have a suit or a nice business casual and a neat and tidy dress. Dress to impress. Choose an appropriate outfit that shows off your finest features so that you appear attractive. Avoid garish, flashy, and loudly colorful clothing as this can overwhelm potential interviewers. Smell nice. Be sure to brush your teeth well and ensure that your breath is fresh and clean. Take a great breath."," That impression can determine how well or poorly we will fit in with others. The goal of most people is to communicate a message in the right style using their voice pitch speed volume and tone of voice. How we create our message is influenced significantly by the text's quality. In an interview, the quality of the text you send is the most important piece of the game.  How the interviewer thinks you are going to read your speech is more important than how hard your voice is heard or how many words you speak at a time."," If you are an interviewer and you are looking to make a first impression, the best start is probably to ask the interviewer a few open-ended questions that allow them to explore the interviewee. These open-ended questions are called probing questions and are generally used to ask why a person did something and their thoughts on why it occurred.  Think of probing questions as follows: “What do you want to know more about? What do you want to know more about this?” Use these questions to learn about the interviewee and make them feel comfortable at the interview. For example, you could say something like, “Now, I’m sure that you do know what the role is. What exactly is it that you do at the company?” or “So now that you’ve talked about the role, I’m wondering if you could tell me how exactly it is that you do it.” If the interviewee is a good candidate for the position, the interviewer will want to have a good impression of the interviewee. It is very easy to judge someone based on their appearance, such as their height or their weight. However, the best way to judge a person is to see how they behave during the interview. If a person is confident during the interview, they will feel better about themselves and more in control of the situation. This is especially important if the interviewee is a candidate for a high-level position. For example, if you are interviewing someone for a senior position, you should let the interviewee know that they have an opportunity to rise up the ladder in the company if they are..."

B2," They have a unique smile that can say all that we need to know. But their number has dwindled dramatically over the last two decades, according to conservationists. They warn that a dramatic shift in the climate is forcing them to find new, warmer waters to live in - making it harder for them to survive. When I first got into this field of work 20 years ago I was lucky to be visiting the sea. My parents would invite me to the ocean with a special purpose - to help educate on the plight of marine life, including dolphins. It was an exciting experience, but a little daunting at the same time. You can't see the creatures in the water, you only see them up close. They were a beautiful part of my school life, so I have always been deeply interested in their conservation. But when I began my postgraduate studies in marine conservation biology in 2005 I realised that they would be struggling even more if we continued this path - so I set out to find out more about the world they live in. Today, I do not regularly visit the sea, instead I work with scientists at the University of York to protect dolphins in the wild and at sea. As a lecturer, I help students understand their environment and why they should take action to help the creatures in need. There is so much to tell, and with so many different species around the world I thought it important to talk about my own experiences in the field."," If ever there was a creature with a reputation for being happy and content, it was the dolphin. The animals live in the oceans and on land. We are fond of them because of the stories about their gentle natures and the joy they bring us in their presence. Dolphins are in danger and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society believes there is little hope for the species ."," It is no surprise then to learn that according to one study, the world is facing a big problem. The world is facing a big problem. According to one study, the world is facing a big problem. And it will take time, but the answer is likely to be quite exciting and exciting!"," If we would only see them regularly, and not just on television or films. Dolphins have a special place in our affections. Many people are still fond of watching them live on the ocean floor. Most of them are not born in captivity and live wild. According to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, the situation of the dolphins is worrying. The population is dwindling at an alarming rate and many of them are now endangered. They do not like to be touched or taken close up because their natural behaviour makes them uncomfortable and they will run away. The population of the dolphins has shrunk more than 80 percent in the past 40 years. The majority of dolphins can now be found in captivity. They live on our coasts and are often called ""zoos"". We find ourselves marveling at them and they are often called heroes because they rescue drowning people. All the stories of dolphins saving lives have moved our hearts and changed the direction of our lives. The dolphins are the greatest friends we have to help us overcome our fears. If we would just spend more time observing them instead of sitting at home and watching the latest TV series or film. Our affections for them is an amazing proof of how much we love them. I have to agree with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. If we would only spend more time with the dolphins, they would change our view of the world and our lives for the better."," According to an online poll by the Sea Life Institute, dolphins are the third most popular animal in the world. But the population of dolphins is decreasing at a speed that could soon be impossible to manage. A quarter of dolphin species in the world has become endangered by overfishing. In the UK, only a tiny percentage of dolphins can be seen in coastal waters at certain times of year. Almost none live to become adults. This decline is the main reason why the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has started a new initiative called Dive. Dive aims to provide a safe haven for as many dolphins as possible, in collaboration with the UK Marine Conservation Society (UKMOCS). They have been asking supporters to visit sea schools across the UK."," They are so much more than just cute cute things on the water. They are also endangered. A small amount of research will tell you more about them. This passage has the right Flesch-Kincaid Grade level for first graders at Grade 1 to Grade 2, but the words might seem too simple or complex for Grade 3 readers to understand."," They are often referred to as 'spirits in the sea'. A friend or family member may offer a hug, a drink or even a piece of food to the humpback or dolphin. However, a study by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society found that over the past 20 years, the species has suffered as a result of a rapid increase in fishing. People are eager to show their love for dolphins, but the numbers of the species have now dropped significantly. As a result of these reductions, many people become anxious to see them. How can we keep them in safe conditions? The dolphins' situation is grim. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society warns that they have been caught in the midst of an overgrazing of other species. It is also believed that the decline of the species is partly due to a reduction in the marine habitat in which they live. You may hear of dolphin populations becoming endangered in certain areas of the world but, as explained by the conservation society, all of the species listed in this category are facing the same threats to their lives. This includes endangered humpbacks, bottlenose dolphins, blue whales and even the sperm whale. All of these species need the same type of action. We also know that humans have the same rights to the sea as the whales. We cannot turn away our eyes from the ocean, so we need to make the most of the sea for ourselves and our future generations."

We’re not like London people who think “oh I can make a living doing something” or “that’s not going to work for me.” ‘When we went to the shops there was no interest in what we had, and my customers kept asking what it was for because they wanted to look at the design.’ ‘I met the man who runs the shop next door and we started working together to sell designs.

B2, Today we call this the Darwinian principle of natural selection. We can use this idea in everyday life to determine which members of a work team are the best fit for a task and work hard to achieve results. The word 'fittest' could be a man or a group of people. The best members have the characteristics and skills that enable them to accomplish a task. They will also be more likely to succeed in terms of their overall work performance.," Through a process of natural selection, the better adapted organisms continue to survive. Which word best describes the content of the article Science and Society? Written Communication"," These characteristics can include shape, colour, strength and size. The fittest animals are usually: larger, brighter and faster than their neighbors. He also theorised that the process could occur at any place and at any time and not only in nature. Darwin did not write a detailed explanation for the process of natural selection, he wrote: ""Of course, it cannot be otherwise than in this way that it exists in nature. I only propose a theory, but not one which needs to be tested."" The original text has changed: ""Of course, it cannot be otherwise than in this way that it exists in nature,"" said Darwin. ""In fact, the whole of the matter is an unanswerable mystery to me, and I only offer a hypothesis."" 
I am reading A history of science for students in Years 4 and 6", The theory of evolution continues to fascinate and inspire and it has an enormous impact on human society today. Today we live in an era where evolution is continually being studied and studied again - with scientists developing new theories and tests of the theory of evolution to determine its validity.," He predicted that new species would evolve through time through natural selection, the process of natural selection in itself. What did he observe? The process of natural selection. Darwin observed new species evolve through time as it was occurring in his laboratory"," He wrote: ""If only those of us who live the longest could live as long as those of the strongest. We, therefore, naturally come to regard in this life-long series of ours the fate of individuals in an order of diminishing chances."" Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published in 1859 and his theory of evolution was published the same year. In the 19th century, this is how evolution was defined as the way organisms developed in successive generations.", When a species reaches a low level of diversity (genetic variance) it degenerates and dies away. Darwin studied and developed a theory of evolution by studying organisms and their behaviour. He was the founder of naturalism and a symbol for the intellectual revolution. Darwin's ideas inspired thousands of scientists across Europe and the Americas. Naturalists are interested in studying the way in which natural and physical phenomena interact with each other. Naturalists study the environment and examine how it influences organisms (the study of 'things'). A naturalist may study the effect of pollution on organisms (in a polluted environment) or the impact of climate on organisms (in a warmer environment). In his book On the Origin of Species Darwin described the process of natural selection that allowed the best organisms to survive and reproduce. Darwin's ideas inspired thousands of scientists. Modern science uses the same concepts.
B2," Glencorn Lodge was in fact an old ruined castle, once known as Glencorn Castle. It's a beauty when the sun isn't shining. There was even a small lake where some of the older members of our family could swim. It was our summer home for the first two years as it was the only one available. After I went back to Scotland I started to travel and I had become less fond of Glencorn Lodge. It was far too far from us. In June 2007 we decided to move again. We moved to another house by the sea in the same town on the edge of the mountains. This time it was in the countryside around the village of Rookery. In a short time we had already taken the decision to rent our house and move there permanently. We had to do something in a hurry, as we were only in Ireland for the second and last time. A couple of nights before we arrived to Ireland we started to talk about what kind of accommodation we would want. What was it like to stay away from the usual hustle and bustle of cities. What would our lives be like if we were completely alone, away from the comforts and distractions of the world. We had seen the pictures of other people on Glencorn Lodge, from the pictures in books and in magazines, we had been told about their beautiful houses. What was it like if one was able to live there without the usual distractions that we were used to? We were looking for something which offered the feeling of ""being there"" but away from the hustle and bustle of a big city. We felt we would never find a perfect house like that so we were very excited when we found a house in the little village of Rookery. The fact that it was close to the mountains was important for us as it meant that we would not be able to get away to the open sea. In a couple of days it was all sorted. We had found a beautiful small house close to the sea. We had even thought about getting our own horses. The perfect holiday. After having lived somewhere like that for a couple of days we realized it wasn't exactly what we wanted. Instead we decided we wanted to stay at Rookery for at least a few months and move out when we came to Scotland. When..."," It's our home for the summer holidays, and we go there frequently. But there's so much more to Ireland than this one spot. Ireland was the name we gave to our first summer trip. We found our home on our first trip and called it Ireland. When it got dark we all loved to sit at the fire and drink our beer with dark chocolate sauce."," The house has a small cottage next door called Troll and that was where we stayed. Our usual stay was four nights but when it came the end of July, a week early, we decided to stay longer. By August, our stay had increased by another week. We had lived in Ireland for months. It had been hard for us to return home. We had no clue when it would happen. We had only met each other for a month at Glencorn Lodge but after that, we had seen each other a few more times. The four of us loved each other and we had grown closer. The time spent together had added to our love.  The end of summer was near when we decided to stay a little longer. We left the cottage on the cliff side and drove up to the main house. We walked on the cliff side for a few minutes and had a great time on the beach. From Glencorn Lodge we walked to the sea cliff. We saw the sea and the houses along the cliff as we walked. It was the best part of our stay. From the cliff we walked up the hill towards the main house. It was amazing to see the mountains and the trees. We had walked for a few minutes and we loved the view. When we got to the main house, we stayed there for another week. We loved being in the main house because it was our own."," I always looked forward to it, but the excitement of new things and new places always filled me with awe. There were always surprises, not always pleasant ones, so the summer holidays were always quite thrilling. On our first day at Glencorn we left Dublin to the car park. We had packed up all the things we'd been buying that day and were about to start loading on the motor coach. It was about half past eleven in the morning and not many people were there, all in the parking lot. We made sure everyone was sitting down as the coach started. A few stops, and we pulled over in the shade near a car park and set up camp. We cooked supper. We ate out of a large metal tin. This was the first evening we had prepared for when they came. The next day at breakfast it was just as clear what the meal was like. At supper, when everyone was seated, I put a paper plate in the middle of the table. There were four dishes. Two of them were filled with rice, two with boiled meat. The meat was a piece of mutton from the side of the road. The other two dishes were empty. Everyone made a meal out of our meal from the plate. When we all sat down, I put the plate back in the middle. At that moment everyone gave a loud sigh. In a moment there was another loud sigh. I looked around. Someone was speaking in a foreign language. I tried to understand what he was saying. I found a pen and paper and wrote it down. It was a German sentence. The next day we were still at the same car park. After much discussion I decided to buy a map and start plotting a route in the middle of the car park. For dinner that night I made a vegetarian meal in a large pot. This was the first meal that we prepared for the people from Ardbeag. That evening there were..."," The whole family got on very well together, the youngest children were in summer holidays with their A-levels. The oldest were getting ready for their year as medical students while their younger sisters were with their summer holidays. Each of us had our own private room so no one was stressed about being on the same bed. We always had the family home on the other side of the Irish Sea so when we travelled with children or grandchildren in August or September we went in our own private rooms. It was easy. We visited Glencorn Lodge on either Sunday or Monday after school in June or July. Our families lived so close together that we often took the short distance walk from one family home to another and from one of the houses to the sea. On the Sunday we often took afternoon tea there before getting to know the neighbours. We always visited Glencorn Lodge in June so that we had our own room where we could read, write and sleep. Glencorn Lodge was our second home. First we had moved out of our parents' house when we were teenagers. There were always people living on our street and my sister took us to Glencorn Lodge while I was in school to learn how to play the piano. It was the first time I had a piano and I was terrified of how I would play it as it was not very big and I could hardly hear myself because I was quite close to the piano. We were never allowed to play at home because my mother didn't want us to be so young. She said we would not be able to get married at the age of thirty and she didn't want us to have children. One night when the music was still playing and we couldn't sleep we decided that we would wake my sister to play the piano. She laughed but we made sure to wake her quietly as we never wanted anyone to know. We spent our weekends on the..."," The lake was right by the house and there was a small park just outside. Glencorn Lodge was our favourite place. We went on holiday every year and everyone was very friendly with everyone in there. We visited the park every day, the lake every evening, and the grounds in the spring. We loved having company every day. They were always very open and welcoming. We loved Glencorn Lodge in June."," She was never very talkative - she loved the quiet time and, when we were out in public, she didn't speak very much and had a sad face.  Our holidays started in a big family and then she joined in. It was our first summer holiday in Ireland."

The rope should not hit him or anyone else. A team of six climbers will try to reach the top of the wall together.

He is the tallest fish in the world and a true giant. As he was finishing his third high school course, Chris got into difficulties with his maths in school.

So how can I help you with your maths problems?' 'Just take your finger off this pencil,' Chris told him. 'And it will turn into a stick. Then when you write your answer...well, you'll know.'

He tried all the other methods but the maths teacher never changed his mind. 'Just take your finger off this pencil,' the teacher said, and Chris removed his finger from the pencil.

Anna has always enjoyed her job, she said: ""The holiday makers are always so happy. ""Anna started at the chalet at 08:00 and came down just after 18:00, she said. The holiday makers who stay at the chalet will be taking a break and she will cook everything that they have ordered in their rooms.

B2," In his paper at the National Meeting, Dr Ashcroft writes: 

The body is designed to respond only to the need to stay alive. But, if it is not responding sufficiently, the body will attempt to prevent the body from death. You will try to keep alive even in the case of a terrible injury. If you have not run for ten days, you will still need an adequate supply of oxygen in your blood to make sure that you can recover. The problem is when the body needs too much oxygen – you will start to lose speed. We can call this the human speed limit. A typical example is for people who play badminton, which requires maximum strength and endurance. However, there is a speed limit, and if you try too hard you will lose speed. The body will attempt to stop your body at this speed limit. So if you play badminton for five minutes, then you know the speed of your body will slow down. It will become slow because you are trying to get to the maximum speed. But you can play more if you are given more time. It is also the same with running. You will have to get as much time as you can to get as much energy out of the body before your body responds to a longer run. Even if you run the same length of time and you get no more oxygen, then your body will still try to beat the human speed limit. Dr Ashcroft writes that it can take a number of days for a run to take its normal recovery, for the body to get new cells. If you run for ten days, for example, then your body will try to beat the speed limit. It will slow down to make room for more training time. Now, imagine if you run a marathon for a million miles in only eight days. The speed limit of the human body would not hold. A number of studies have shown that you could run for almost five times as long if you did a 10-minute jog every day for three years. I like to think that the body's human speed limit is closer to a mile a minute than two hundred meters. I think the limits of the human body are different for every person, and the human...", The race began and Hicham El Guerrouj won the time and is reported as making it to the end in a record time. This is only about 1500 meters.," Dr Ashcroft believes that the first two to three metres of the run are the most important in a race. In the first two metres, the runner moves quickly. The following four to six metres is when the runner becomes tired. Dr Ashcroft believes that the human body can only manage 30 to 50% of the work in the first two metres. The human body needs a good supply of oxygen in the blood stream to start running. Dr Ashcroft believes the main source of oxygen is the runner's muscles. The muscles take oxygen through their blood stream from the lungs. As a result, the oxygen needed from the body is higher in the first two metres of the run. After the first two to three metres, the body begins to lose oxygen at a greater rate. This happens because the muscles of the runners start to decompose to release their energy for the next few metres. As the body begins to decompose, the human body loses power. The human body becomes so weak that it cannot keep up. Dr Ashcroft explains that this is how the human body uses the natural law of conservation of energy. For every unit of oxygen carried through the body, the human body needs to break the oxygen into glucose molecules. To break down the oxygen in the first two metres, the muscles of the runners have to produce energy. For this energy, the muscles have to use their stored fat. The stored fat gives the muscles energy to work. The stored fat helps the muscles to provide energy when they need it the most. The lost fat helps to prevent injuries. Dr Ashcroft believes this is why runners who burn fat become more powerful. The main source of energy for the muscles is fat because fat is the main source of energy. Dr Ashcroft believes that runners who have fat deposits around their legs are likely to have more fat to burn during a race than runners who lack fat. To maintain energy during a race, the..."," What we see is the human body being dragged along by a series of mechanical devices that are made out of muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments. These mechanical devices are moving very slowly but they are working. This means that when you run, they slow down at a rate which matches the speed you can generate as you run. But the muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments are weak and these mechanical devices are slow to develop. This means that speed is not something that can be simply developed through constant repetition of training. As you become more experienced you will find that even in your slowest speeds, you generate higher speeds and that eventually you will be able to achieve the human speed limit."," ""By the time we reach the point where we have to start slowing down, we’re already tired,"" she said. ""It’s probably not that physically we can hold that form for three minutes and thirty seconds. In a marathon the time you’d normally need, say, is probably four or five minutes. But this is probably the fastest anyone has ever achieved, so it’s not that physically possible to do it."""," Dr. Frances Ashcroft  and other researchers are researching the causes of human powerlessness in running. In 1968 a US newspaper article by a physicist called Robert Cannon was published, showing that the speed at which a shock wave moves through body tissue has a profound effect upon muscle function. In this study he showed that, in a shock wave, the muscle cells die but the tissue around them survives. It seemed that the muscle is a hard, hard object. But, in our study we found that this muscle is not hard. The muscle cell membrane around the muscle is soft. So the shock wave of the muscle cell is soft. It is the softness of the membrane that is responsible for the improvement in performance in athletics. The membrane acts as a shock shield. This is in contrast to the hardness of the muscle fibres inside the muscle which are responsible for the resistance to fatigue. When there is a sudden increase in work the muscle fibre will contract, but the shock shield function of the membrane will reduce the force required by the muscle cell to contract. The muscle is not a hard object so it is possible to beat the speed of the light to run 100 meters. The membrane will protect the muscle cells and the tissue. The speed of the shock wave is so much faster than the speed of sound that it may cause problems for those who already suffer from a degenerative disease, like Alzheimer's. If there is an increase in force, the shock shield may not protect the muscles. The shock shield function may not be enough to protect the muscle cells.

B2," There were numerous skating competitions for the honor of the family. However, this is very dangerous and the competition was usually a matter of death. The upper classmen would beat the children of poor families, taking advantage of the fact that the rich families could buy ice skates made of iron which had good handles. By the end of the 6th century Ice was a popular pastime in all parts of Scandinavia. Starting in the mid 20th century the sport was revived."," They were educated to use good form in their skating, as well as be able to control their speed. They were also used as sports to win, or to get into the upper classes. Iron added to bone skates increased their strength, speed and durability. Many iron skates were made before iron arrived in Scandinavia. The first skates made from iron were made by a farmer. In the first century of the common era iron skates were made to skaters to win in the horse races. Some of the winners of the race were allowed to have their skates made from iron. Ice skating is still a favorite sport. You might like this story about ice skates, if you are a young student."," People used wooden blocks to propel themselves, but when the iron replaced wood they produced a new form of skating, the iron skating. The new skating is said to have been developed in the north of Scandinavia. For centuries skating has been one of the most important recreational activities in Europe. In some parts of the world the ice skating is regarded as a form of artistic expression. 
_________________________________________________________________________ In the early years of the skating season the ice was made for skating by people using animal bones, skaters would skate on the ice. Animal bone skates could be of an iron or wooden material. Ice was laid out with a piece of wood on top. The best skaters would be able to skate without falling over thanks to a thin skin on their foot. Skaters would walk along this skin and then continue with the next move. Once on the ice they would use their arms and legs to push with their skates towards the middle of the ice. They would hit the ice with the bottom of their skates and pull back with their arms and legs."," These upper class people wanted to show their wealth. They also wanted to show their social status. Skates could be expensive so only the richest people owned them. They would go on skating dates with their social and business associates. For the upper class these dates often included banquets, music, and dancing. Some of the upper class would get drunk so they would be on the lookout for any signs of crime. To ensure safety, they would take a special police watch on their dates. The police watch was very detailed. A woman wearing a gold choker and long sash would serve as the police watch watcher. In the dance they would move in a circle with the watch. The watcher would point at the right hand of the woman in the circle. This would reveal the direction of her next move. She would never be in danger, but she would take a risk. The watcher was only protecting her from violence. A woman who had the gold choker and long sash would be the police watch."," After the first iron skates were introduced people started to make their own ones out of wood, leather, cloth and stone. Around the 2nd century, wooden skates began to make their first appearance in Northern Europe. They were first used to cross the fields. In this way they made it easier for farmers to keep their horses and draft animals tethered. Over time, iron skates were replaced by wooden and glass skates made of marble, wood and glass. In about 500 AD, people began to use glass as a substitute for iron. Glass skates were the first to use reflective surface to attract the attention of the public. Since then skates in glass and glass-reinforced glass, with metal wheels and wooden ends, have been used for centuries. ICE SKATES Are made from what materials? Animal bone."," Ice skating was first introduced into the U.S. in the 1800s. The ice skates are made from wood, metal, or rubber.   The first record of skates being used in competition dates back as early as the 1930s. The rules were modified in 1956 to allow for better regulation. In the 1960s, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale was first developed.   In America, skating became popular in the 1970s.   Skating was popular for its health benefits. By 2009, according to the American Council on Sports Medicine, ice skating and other sports involving the wearing of skates are beneficial for the cardiovascular system and help to improve lung and lower-limb blood flow. The history of skates also has many strange origins. Skates can be made from animal bone. The earliest skates were likely made from animal bones, but they were not used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. In the 1920s, skating took off in the United States. Today, most skaters wear skating skates made from wood or metal.  The United States' most famous ice skating teams are New York City's and Los Angeles'. The skating team is a group of women called the ""Frog Lady."" Ice skating teams were once seen as a sign of social class."," Skaters in Scandinavia wore skates made from animal bone. Many cultures had similar ideas. They included Greece, China and India. Today, the Ice skating events are held worldwide. The modern practice of ice skating dates to the 11th century AD. The modern practice of ice skating dates to the 11th century AD.

B2," Suzie Ellis was impressed at the strength and determination of the players. Kendra Slawinski: 'We have always been strong and determined so this is probably the best preparation we've been in.' Ellis: 'Yes. You would expect this is the biggest tournament so you've got to be strong to survive' Kendra Slawinski: 'It is.' Suzie Ellis: 'It's hard to describe the feeling of knowing that you're here for something bigger than yourself.' Kendra Slawinski: 'You know, one thing we've always been strong and determined for and we’ve done. This year, we're not even thinking about how this is going to affect us in the tournament. But it will. But then, it is also a motivation and it is very positive for everyone.'"," For me it was a normal day until my friend asked to see her on Facebook. Suddenly her life had changed. She had made an interesting connection with me, and her Facebook profile had changed a little bit. Suzie was now photographed as a very happy, confident and happy woman. In my opinion she had changed."," Kendra Slawinski was well aware of the fact that the day would be a busy one. Her work day had ended on Tuesday. As she stood at the front door of her home Suzie Ellis asked what time she had finished her day's teaching. In other words, what day of the week would she have started again to teach next week? I don't know about you but I think we all know what day that would be Monday. This was a busy week for everyone as England’s players had arrived home from their latest world championship finals. Suzie Ellis had decided to stop teaching at the end of the week and go to the supermarket just to see the players off. As she said before, the day would be busy. However the morning began in a rather different manner for her. She'd been told at 9am that she'd start again at lunch time the following week to finish her last day of the week. What a shock, didn't you think? While she was having breakfast at the morning meeting she'd been telling her colleagues that she had been told she'd have a holiday next week and would not be able to teach at the start of the week in question. The news had stunned everyone. Suzie Ellis was shocked, I had a lump in my throat and the thought that she would now teach for five days straight, all without any notice, came over me. When she informed us of this at the meeting I immediately felt I had to warn Suzie about the implications. She had made the decision to not just stop teaching the week before the world championships, but not let anyone know that she had done so. I asked what I should do about it and she offered her hand. She offered to let everyone know that she was going on holiday until she'd found out when she'd be able to start again. Everyone agreed so she let everyone know. At lunch I asked Suzie about what her plans were for next week. 'Well I have a holiday coming up and it seems to me that if I..."," In Suzie's words, 'Kendra is very busy teaching and coaching.' She and her team mates train six nights a week. After teaching Suzie taught one of her classes. I knew Kendra was busy but I did not know how she came up with the time to get involved in this sport and with that busy schedule. The best Suzie ever told me about it was about half an hour into the lesson: 'She teaches four nights a week plus training time in car parks so she is extremely busy!' She looked around the classroom with a smile and asked: 'The girls would you like to get to know the new recruit?' I took the position of speaking with the group of girls about their new recruit. The group smiled and hugged each other as they talked about Kendra. I watched Kendra approach her students one at a time and greeted them, smiled, and said hello. Suzie's introduction to Kendra's hard work was done very well indeed. At the end of the lesson I asked Suzie what she thought of the new student. She said, 'Kendra is wonderful - I know we have some time this summer to get together and work together!"," Today, she had a special guest: Miss Jones, a retired teacher of English who wanted to join them on an extra mission. She said if she could help Suzie get used to the English way of communicating she would be pleased to help. What kind of English language do you think they need to communicate with each other? If Miss Jones can help Suzie Slawinski get used to how we English speakers communicate, which do you think of her English ability. Miss Jones"," Kendra's day continued as she walked to train as part of the England squad, but for those of you who were lucky enough to catch her at one of her training sessions, you were lucky to hear her talk. Kendra is clearly a force to be reckoned with, as the girls in England's squad are so incredibly talented. She told me a story. Suzie Ellis is a journalist. Suzie arrived in England on Friday and began working on her piece the following day. Kendra arrived in England on Sunday and her session began the next day. Across the room, Kendra smiled as her first question was addressed by the press officer. Kendra has been the England national netball squad member since 2010. Her parents taught English in Uganda.

B2," Do you know what the entire world is publishing every day? Over 20 million people. They've made a living out of the fact that we all want information. They're selling it to us, which is why they need so much information to keep making money. They can sell it to us. It's called advertising."," We use so much technology, that our phones are constantly bombarded with notifications. It's hard to escape the digital news cycle. People like us are on this information overload forever. One of the things we have lost is the ability to just read and absorb information.", Do you read the newspaper or the news website? In this question we are asking readers whether they follow the news. It is an open question. We also want to see how they are reading. Does they read the complete news? Do they follow it all? Is it hard or easy? This is also a good opportunity to explore gender differences. How are you reading news? What are your reactions? Are you too lazy to read?, There are tons of other news providers. But the stories they are offering in a single piece are often a selection of the most relevant for a specific topic or subject. This is how the news: Read the news. This is because news comes in fragments -- small pieces that can be related by their themes or subjects; they don't need to come from the same place.," This amount of information is very hard for a student like me to absorb. I am not an expert on technology or on the economy but I can say from my own experience that this volume of information takes too much of my attention. I am forced to look for things that I need to find or ignore what I don't need to find. As a result, I am not able to read whole news articles because I can only concentrate on a very small section. This is also a factor why I will only buy a subscription to Reuters and not a newspaper, because you can't read whole news articles on it."," In general, news sources are harder to read than fiction because they are written in narrative form (for instance, a story) instead of being presented in a narrative form (for instance, a news item). 

That's the reason news readers should be able to follow the main plot (i.e., what the main idea is in the text) rather than the main speaker (i.e., who is speaking), because the main speaker is always a writer. You don't have to write a novel but the reader must understand the main plot rather than getting lost among all the details. You can write a lot if you don't understand what you're writing and when you're writing."," I found that we used to think all of those words are in the same sentence. We used to think all the following sentences were in the same sentence: 'I want a new bike'. Now we realise they're in separate sentences and they're not saying the same thing. That's part of the news cycle. That's part of reading. You find out that 'he' does the same thing as 'him' and 'he' is the same thing as 'his' - it's easy to memorise them if you are familiar with these. When we get to the part of sentence where a pronoun is used it becomes harder. He means 'you'. Is there a gender difference between them? This word means 'it'. She means 'the'. What's the difference? It's clear: 'that' means 'that part of the bike', 'this' means 'the one that is on that side'. In this situation, you can use either to describe the bike. But as soon as we get to the 'this' part we start to get into trouble. I think the sentence needs two words. But that word doesn't stand alone. This is another good example of using the subordinator and coordinating word. In this case the coordinating word is 'this'. This is the 'this' part of the bike. And the subordinator is 'this'. I don't know how you get to that stage when you start to get a bit confused. So when you're looking up the meaning of this in the dictionary there you can see that that is another word. I found out I have very, very, very hard time understanding sentences when it starts to get hard. When I hear 'that' use as a subordinator, I see that there is another word in that case.

This made Avery suspicious but did not tell him as she was afraid his suspicions would have come back to haunt him. After a few minutes he found his door open and a man in his late 20s with glasses sitting in the office. It was a man he recognized and it didn't take long to find the name on the books and realize his suspicions had been right, Mitch had been at work late. He called security to check on him and the man in his late 20s just walked right out of the office with no fuss as if he did not even know who the man was."," He went into Avery's office, which was empty. There was a phone in the office that would have rung out if his boss had been able to hear it. It wasn't a busy night.", He was surprised to find it was vacant. Avery had moved out the night before.

B2," My mum gave me my first job as a film critic in an advert for a new film which did not actually make it out of the country. In the early stages of my career at The Front Page I interviewed an actor I had known from school for years - Jack Ewers. He had been a local actor in the film industry and had already been cast in a big name drama. That gave me my first real idea of the type of job I would end up with after years of doing bits and pieces of the job for local newspapers. I also spent a year in London, working at the Radio 1 and Radio 2 studios while I was studying for the degree I currently hold. And, for me at least, it was something of a dream come true - I spent time with the famous people and saw just how big the industry really is."," I wanted to be in a newspaper since I was too young to work for Radio Scotland and I was keen for a different job with a bit more money on it. All I knew about working as a film critic was from studying under other film critics. My time as a film critic was pretty good so I never had a problem with it. The hardest thing was to deal with the other film critics. I would like to go out with them in a pub, but I have no time to go out. At work I would rather eat a lunch with my colleagues than spend time with a film critic who might be a good friend of my boss at the magazine I review for."," I enjoyed every hour of it but not too much about being a film critic, as I never got paid for much of it. I am, however, very fond of it. In my ten year career as a film critic I got to see a wide range of movies, from the dark comedies to the classics. I even liked to tell my colleagues at the radio how to look at a film. My most memorable piece was the final piece of work for The Front Page, when I was asked to review The Social Network and directed by Neil Burger. I really enjoy making a film review, I always do, and I am quite pleased with my own writing, even if I have no money for it (although some of the things that I have written are paid for by the Front Page's advertisers). After I started looking back over my work I knew that I had done a good job. There were two main things that made my review so good. The first was that I kept a lot of notes and I found the format of my review to be good. The second was that I really liked what I was writing. It was always something I had a lot of interest in and something I had an opinion on, so it seemed as if I always had something valuable to say. I think I might have liked it even more if I had been paid something for it, which I hope may happen, in the future."," This year I will be doing my second job as a film critic for a weekly television programme called BBC Films. As I go back to my first job, I realise that the last few years have been some of my best days as a film critic. I am always amazed when people talk about my writing skills and how well I know films. I am not, however, amazed when I am asked what I do for a living. I laugh and say ""I'm a film critic"". The person I am talking to doesn't understand why I have to mention this last job because it is not really one of those jobs. After the awkward moment passes I realise it was because I wanted to highlight that my best days were over and that it was time to move on.

The road goes up the steep slopes in the same fashion it goes up the mountains.," It is just like the picture on the cover of my book. In my childhood I travelled all over the world. When I came to visit the UK I wanted to visit the villages that I have always looked forward to visiting - with their quiet villages and their peaceful lives. In many ways they were just like the pictures of my childhood. Lastingham village is a lovely small village in the valley above a hill which is just like the cover to my book. It is full of pretty terraced houses with traditional English roofs. There were pretty orchards and the small square in the middle was full of old terraced houses. The village was peaceful, like that in my childhood. All in all I love visiting Lastingham in the valley and the little green church is very beautiful.", The small cobbled streets were full of colourful residents. At the river there were horses and people walking and sitting beside it. I loved this place.," The village has a couple of old temples and a lovely lake. I can still remember how beautiful the village was. The villagers didn't build their homes for them, but instead used to live out in the valley. It was a very happy place. It's wonderful places like Lastingham, where people work hard for their livelihoods instead of enjoying their life, which brings peace."," When I first got to Lastingham, it was just like home. The beautiful village of Lastingham had its own church. This was built in the 13th century and was quite a pity that it had fallen into disrepair and was not used as a church. On Sundays I would wander over to Lastingham Church and ask if I could use the church as a chapel or maybe a church. They would say no but I would never give up my dream. In the village, there were a few pubs. I liked listening to the music of Bruce Springsteen and I would often visit the pub at Lastingham if I was not playing rock. I used to sit at the back of the pub and look out on the valley. Now Lastingham's history has been lost. A lot of what I remember is of the villages of the valley and the beautiful church. It has a great future."," I don't think I will travel as often unless I need to go abroad again.

'They will be making fun of us,' Archie said. 'They are very nice at that place' Mrs Easterbrook continued. Mrs Easterbrook went down the stairs and found the place was full. Mrs Easterbrook had to leave the door open and told Archie to take her to the next room. The guests began to eat. They started to laugh. Archie said they were joking. They kept saying that they were joking. One of the guests asked if it was true. Mrs Easterbrook could hear a gunshot outside. She called her husband. He was outside the door. The gun shot went off. Archie was upstairs in the dining room looking at the papers and newspaper front pages. Mrs Easterbrook said she was frightened. Mrs Easterbrook got up and left the room. Mrs Easterbrook told Archie not to stop the party if she was in danger. Mrs Easterbrook left the party. Archie and Mrs Easterbrook were left alone together. Mrs Easterbrook went downstairs and found the room was empty. Mrs Easterbrook asked Archie what had happened. Archie said she knew who had gone out. Mrs Easterbrook got up and walked downstairs. She asked Mrs Easterbrook why she couldn't leave the country. Mrs Easterbrook explained that they were staying at a hotel, in town, next to the railway station. Mrs Easterbrook was taken into a room and sent to the Hotel. Mrs Easterbrook was informed that..."

B2, They did what they wanted to the building and it was empty. Now on the third floor of the empty building stands an empty building. No people at all. It is uninhabitable. The empty building contains the remains of the People's Republic of China.," The building was the office of the chief of police, Wang Luo. He looked at the clock and nodded. Five minutes and twenty-five seconds later he walked past the office, his feet tapping the metal steps on the stone floor. One of the police officers in uniform stood in front of the door, his chin in his hands. He took out a hand gun. Wang Luo turned and faced the wall, and bowed his head."," A riot broke out at this time. It was the first time such riots ever took place in this particular colony. It was the beginning of the British Empire. The colony had not always been this way. There were always wars between the British and Chinese, but when the Chinese wanted something it would be done. But now it was different. Chinese rules the entire colony. The British just had to watch. When the Chinese saw the riots, they arrested them. Some days later they put them in prison until the end of the Qing dynasty. The British, who liked it that way, didn't want that. They wanted to keep the riots going. They tried every kind of trick to stop the riot, but there was no way to do it. The British and the Chinese would always fight again. The British would only take things from the Chinese. But the Chinese would never give them back. They would never leave the colony they owned. They would never give them back. When they wanted something, they would take it."," The walled city, Kowloon, was never surrounded by a wall. There was a long passageway, a bridge with narrow gates. Sometimes people used it as a way to cross a waterway. And people used the passageway and bridge as a way to enter the walled city in a very peaceful time. On one side of the bridge was a large building with a few people inside. The building was only just inside the passgeway. It was the main entrance to the walled city. On the other side of the passageway was a smaller building with people inside. It was the exit. The entrance was the main way of entry into the town. People could go into the walled city, but they could also go out of it without having to enter the town. People used the passageway to get into the walled city. There was no exit that people used. The people in the main building could also leave the walled city. They could not come in the main building or out of it. After entering the main building, they would walk to the exit. From the main building the exit led to a small building. On the side of the building was a small stairway. The stairs went up to the main building. People could get from the exit to the main building without coming into the main building. And they could come out of the main building. People used the stairs to get from the exit to the main building. The exit was at the end of the stairway. People going in or going out of the main building walked to the exit. The main entrance into the walled city was the bridge with its wide open gate. People would enter the walled city by going through the bridge. They would walk across the bridge in both directions. The passageway was wide open. It allowed people to cross the bridge to go from the main building to the..."," It was an uncharted territory. For over a century the colony developed itself but had no concept of government, no concept of law. People were free to do what they liked, in short they were untouched! It was one of those places called ""outlawland"" which in the late 19th Century was the home of outlaws in a society ruled by law. So called ""savage men"" ran wild and raided. The outlawland was a violent, dangerous place. The people of Kowloon Walled City grew used to the violence and became accustomed to it. It seemed normal to them, they didn't mind. They knew that whatever they did it wouldn't harm anyone else, they knew that their lives would be safe. It was like living in a dream! Not wanting to disturb the peace in the colony they simply made their own rules in order to live harmoniously. People of Kowloon Walled City often used to live in harmony as long as they could. But that harmony fell because their new rules didn't protect them and when a law had to do with their business it was applied to their business too. They didn't like that. So they tried to force their rules on others, but people refused to cooperate. They made themselves an independent country. This was considered ""self-defence"" because in such a situation you have no choice but to defend yourself. And self-defence is the last thing you think of as a first world nation. It seemed that this is the only way they could live harmoniously. They were not happy with it but wanted to continue the life in harmony they have lived. The government didn't know what to do about it. At one time the government agreed to their new rules as they wanted to let them live their life without worrying about their lives anymore. But one by one people were outnumbering the authorities. This made people angry. The authorities decided to make a change. They agreed not to allow law to have effect on their business. But they didn't let them use their own rules. They wanted to force everyone to cooperate...."," In its own words China did not want to be considered an independent country. Chinese rules in Kowloon were simple - a woman who was not married could have no more than five children and her children would be kept in good shape. Her husband would then be free to go for another wife. The Chinese woman would not be allowed to leave her house at all. Chinese did not take into account the other countries in that colony. One hundred years ago British government used to control Kowloon. The British government used to control every aspect of a man's life. It controlled his clothing, his health, his education, his freedom and his income. If he did not have what the British considered his basic necessities then he would be relegated back to the working class and be made to work for nothing. The British government gave these people the rights to vote. British were allowed to judge them, beat them and imprison them. This colony became the People's Republic of China in 1945 when it was created after the British pulled their troops out of the colony. From those British prisoners of war came many of those who would become the Chinese government workers. A few decades later China was declared to be an independent nation by the communist movement. It took a while for the Chinese government to...","The area was known as Kowloon when British owned the island in 1856. The Chinese didn't want foreigners to live there, so they did not have a wall around their territory. What happened in the past was that the people lived in wooden palaces that were the same with British style. There was a large part of the island that belonged to China and the Chinese wouldn't let anyone else live there. The Chinese built large wooden structures to look like the British style and the Chinese only allowed Hong Kong people to live there."
B2," Until a group of farmers came together with the promise of providing them with a place where they could develop their own farms. Soon enough the model village has a small farm, garden and restaurant. Now there are farmers, gardeners and a small restaurant. The model village has also provided some jobs as well as a helping hand for a local charity. When you enter the Model Village and see that its a community that is helping those in need it is very surprising. The people who live there are very friendly and the local hospital works hard to meet the medical needs of local people. At the end of this story they will have developed their own farms to produce their food and there will be a small restaurant with them as well."," But the arrival of Mr. And Mrs. Smith from Scotland was a turning point and they invested their hard earned money into turning this piece of land into something of a paradise. The villagers are very helpful, they know exactly what they are doing and do it with great enthusiasm! You will find their little shops full of beautiful handmade goods. On the way you will pass the historic place where, according to legend, the local king murdered the first king who ruled here for over 100 years. Your walk ends on the cliff edge overlooking the sea."," But after a few years of careful cultivation and gardening, the soil was turned into a beautiful garden that has now been brought to life. What has not changed is the large and beautiful building housing the model village hall. We are now entering our second year of living in the new Model Village, we are also part of a growing community. What we wish to change for the second year is the garden area. For the garden there will be plants, shrubs and flowers. A new garden will be created."," Today it has become one of the most beautiful places on the planet . A man was there to give birth to a newborn baby, but soon his body appeared in a tree and he died, and that was it. The man thought he had died. The trees seemed to take in his spirit and became his companion. He walked with the tree and the trees helped him learn how to walk and talk . For many years it was just a piece of flat dirt, but thanks to the trees it became a beautiful place."," However, during the last five years a little help from an expert has brought this little piece of land back to life with some very special plants. The people of the town love to garden so they plant what they think their plants will grow. When you see a gardening plot you will always notice that there are some plants of special interest that are planted there. They are called special plants. As you progress down the stairs, you'll notice that in each one of the different rooms you will find special plants of a different type. You can plant special plants as often as you want. Once a month, the villagers will collect all the special plants they grow from each floor. The villagers will use these plants to raise soup to feed the villagers who live below in their village."," The model community was one of hope, but was unfortunately not quite the miracle it seemed. Text contains high percentage of dialogue. All of the text contains low amount of information."," However, after a good financial investment the villagers were able to change their minds and make this model village the most successful village in the world. The new villagers live by the rules of the Model Village. They follow strict rules, like always putting on a smile and greeting everyone. Most people in the Model Village are happy and successful. At first glance they might appear quite ordinary, but they are not. The model village has the highest level of education of all countries. The only way to change this is to become a member. The rules of the Model Village are clear and straight forward. You are required to follow these rules to enter the Model Village and become a member. In the Model Village people from all backgrounds live happily together. All the members are accepted as equal and no member is treated as inferior."
B2," But the theme park here is still great fun for kids. It has lots of rides and activities, and has several attractions on the theme of Scotland. If you like a quiet, idyllic environment, or a spot with a great historical atmosphere, Fun Island is the place for you. If you want to take a closer look at Scotland, Fun Island has several attractions which are based on themes such as horses or cattle. All in all we went there three times and found it great fun for the whole family. The Harris family If you enjoy a bit of adventure, a fairytale themed theme park in the Scottish Highlands would be the perfect place. It has all the trappings of a fairytale - it's full of whitewashed walls, and fairy-tale buildings. But it's full of adventure, with lots of climbing, bouldering, and rollercoasters. It's definitely a fun place to visit. The McNab family We went to Fun Island this summer, and loved it. It was a perfect family day out, with a lot of entertainment and plenty of activities, without going to the beach. The Nohara family Fun Island is a fun family park that is well worth a visit. If you are having a family day out and want to enjoy some great thrill rides and have loads of fun, then Fun Island is the place for you. The Taylor family We have been to Fun Island with our four kids, and it's a great place to visit with kids. Fun Island is a great destination in Scotland for you to go when you are on a family outing.", But we were wrong. We loved all of them! I had to start all over - all of a sudden I couldn't think of anything! What fun! We had fun with the other families too! The fun that you can have on Fun Island is endless! All of them have their own personalities.," However, on a recent trip we went there again and it became one of our favorite theme parks. There was so much to see and explore. The Burns Family I remember my son, Adam, was quite excited when he heard that there was a Disney theme park nearby. He is a Disney fan and we went along to watch their movie in 3D. The theme park is very much like Disney World in California. They have lots of rides and games. My wife, Susan, is a Disney fan too and loved the rides. The Disney princesses are everywhere and there is a whole new experience. The Disney film has its own set of rules and rules for dress and manners. I think the theme park has brought a smile to Adam's face and a new experience to our family. The Burns Family In a city on the Cotswolds, there is an indoor theme park called Spitting Image. It was built in a farmhouse and has been converted to a theme park in the past two years. Children can play in the sand and explore the theme park. They can play games, meet the real people in the pasture where the farmhouse was, and they can even get a drink from the bar of the theme park. The Smith family The Smith family have recently been spending some holidays in the UK at their new home in Kent, England. They are big fans of the theme park Fun Island and we have witnessed their enthusiasm for it. They are especially fond of the 3D films that they can watch in the park. The Smith family I have known Adam for quite a long time and know him well. Adam is the son of one of the owners of the park. He..."," What a surprise it turned out to be a great place! It has a lovely indoor play park with a wide variety of rides for children of all ages. It's also a good place for younger children to hang out and relax, which we found really helpful! Chris and Laura - The Williams Family If you are looking for fun on a budget and a little more of a challenge then this may be just the place for you! Chris and Laura are always looking for new experiences in travel, especially things to do for their daughter. They loved their stay here because they felt like they had the freedom to do activities of their choice and didn't feel confined to one section. It's a great place to bring your kids on holiday or as a family for a more relaxed stay. Fun Island - The Harris Family We love this place - the children loved it! It is a great fun place for families, especially for children to grow together. It has a play park which is really busy especially when the weather is good and it's a really large park area. There is also an outdoor play park with a pirate ship which is a great addition if you want your child to have fun and explore at the same time. Fun Island - The Dutton Family If you're looking for a quiet getaway and lots of privacy then this is the place for you! The Dutton family likes this place because you can stay in your own room and away from your children or other guests. They found it very relaxing and we loved the fact that they have their own little garden and pool and the..."," But to our surprise, it had much more to offer. We were amazed how beautiful the island was and how we could get involved. We loved it. We would like to go back. A History of Britain - The Balls family In this case the theme park was chosen by the parents and the children chose to travel to a specific place to learn history. We were shocked at the difference. We learned loads about Scotland's history in such a fun way. The stories told were inspiring. In our time we could go on our own but when the children went to their schools, they really took to the theme park. We loved it. We would like to go again. A British Art - The Rovers family We went to a museum which had lots of artwork. In this case the people involved were young children and it was very educational for them. We were really impressed. The children loved it too. We would recommend it."," All of a sudden there we were in a giant ship, sailing around an island and watching lots of strange animals that seemed very brightly coloured. What was Fun Island for the kids? Why didn't the kids think it was fun? A good story has a good ending, but what happens to the kids after reading a good story? The answer is: They are curious about what happens next. A good story has a lot of detail, lots of questions, and a little suspense. How is the story told? How is the story done? Does it seem logical? What are the key characters in the story? How do the main scenes seem connected? What are the parts of the story that get your attention? These will be measured using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale. If a family goes to a theme park, what is their reaction? None of the above choices .", But I can't say that we didn't enjoy it. Our children loved it. Fun Island - The Burns Family The park was bigger but it felt very small. We couldn't make it all on a weekend. Fun Island - The Burns Family The Burns family's children enjoyed the playground. Fun Island - The Burns Family The Burns family's children played on the pool and enjoyed the children's pool area. The Burns family's children played basketball on the hard courts. Fun Island - The Burns Family The park had a giant water slide. Fun Island - The Burns Family When the time came to leave the kids were very tired. Fun Island - The Burns Family The Burns family's children enjoyed the playground. Fun Island - The Burns Family The children played football on the artificial football court. Fun Island - The Burns Family We could not find any special things to do here. Fun Island - The Burns Family Fun Island was the best theme park for the kids.

B2," I did everything the teacher expected me to do in my class, I never asked a question, I never got up in the wrong places or in the wrong order. I tried to act normal so I wouldn't bother the teacher. But I became too self-conscious and felt uncomfortable in my own skin so I decided to learn to be confident. Nina Hathway, BBC News

Samantha At age 8 I remember walking home from school in a small pink school uniform and my friends and I went into a school hallway with a huge bag with my school supplies. The bag seemed a little heavy for me and I felt uncomfortable. I looked down in the hush of the hallway at a small girl sitting alone in her chair, her bag open and her head facing her. The little girl smiled at me and I knew then that it was meant to be. I walked over and sat at the empty chair at the school's end of the hallway, where Samantha was sitting. She was a quiet girl, I did not even know her name but I remember hearing a smile from her eyes. One day I decided she might like me and I kissed her, but then I realized I was just following a pattern, kissing girls who had bags of belongings in their hands and sitting quietly with no friends to disturb me, or other girls I met as I walked home from school. A Dane Jenny Lideman, BBC News

Katie Jane I used to look ridiculous sitting on the floor at home. I didn't like the way I looked, I felt I wasn't a good enough person because I didn't always wear nice clothes. I felt like I didn't have good enough friends or a good enough boyfriend, I didn't like the way other people looked at me, and I thought I would never find love. The things I felt were rooted in my childhood, growing up in South Africa, when we had no money and no clothes to wear. I felt I wasn't good enough so I decided I would make myself look better so that no one would be the reason I could never feel good. Gina Caffyn, BBC News"," When I got older, I realized that I was an extrovert. As a result of being an extrovert, I had to learn to be more confident. I would talk to new people and show my personality. I think having a good support system can help you learn to be more confident. Lori I am a very bubbly girl and always had confidence. It took a while to get my confidence back, but now that I'm more comfortable and I'm better at handling my feelings I think I have it back. Amy I've been shy all my life and it makes me feel really awkward when I'm around people. Luckily I found that you can't hide your feelings forever but when you feel confident and calm you know it's okay. Dina When I'm in a group I have confidence in my opinions, I can give my opinion and stand up for myself. I was always good at speaking in front of other people because I am quiet.

Jessica Muffler I started to relax in my personal space. In the past I used to always have my cellphone with me. Jessica Muffler," One thing led to another and I could no longer hide what I was.

Jenny is a confident person who went through her school life with her head held high. Gina When I was 17, I found confidence was such a difficult problem. Everyone was saying to me 'you should be confident' but I was always insecure. I didn't know that it was actually the confidence I was lacking. Rebecca I realised confidence was not something I inherited, it was something I built up with the practice of positive self talk. Jennifer I felt that people would always make fun of me because I didn't have confidence. I thought that they would say things like 'you don't look very confident, do you want to get over that' but I'm actually quite a confident person and have lots of people to rely on, so I've moved past them! Natalie I didn't know how to build up confidence but I just went from bad to good. I had a lot of insecurities about myself and other people in my life, so I used an online confidence boosting website and had positive talk sessions with a counsellor and I was happy to see a change within a month. Gina"," Sarah A new friend told me to stop being shy. She said being confident is not just a skill you learn, it's a feeling that you have. Jennifer When I was growing up I was always a little self-conscious. But now, I'm one of those kids who can't help but be outgoing. Jenny"," Nina She had to. Nina The best thing a person can do to learn something is to use their head. Nina The best thing to learn a language is to learn the grammar. Nina I learned Italian by heart. Nina You are only as good as your last exam. Gina It wasn't just the grammar but all the things they were doing. Gina If a language teacher said a learner was using too many grammatical items and not enough information points, the learner would probably dislike him or her. In fact, teachers generally don't recommend using too many information points unless you can afford to pay the extra. Gina People learn from the things they are not afraid of. Gina The best thing to learn language is to speak it. Gina A language is a series of things you can do together. Gina There are lots of things you can do with a language and nothing to be ashamed of. Nina How was it when you first used it in the real world? Gina It was very natural. Gina A lot of people never used their Italian in the real world.

B2," But Charlie James says it's not just a beautiful blue-green bird it's also a symbol of hope to many who have lost hope. He wants to tell us all about how the kingfisher is in danger of extinction and why he believes he can save them. Here is his interview with us. Charlie James from BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: 'It's a beautiful bird it's got blue-green bill and it's got blue-green feathers on its back.' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: What do you do for a living? Charlie James: I am Wildlife Photographer.' Charlie James: In what country are you from?' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: In my area, it's called North East England in the north of England.' Charlie James: Where do you live?' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: I live just in the village of Blackpool, North East England, in Lancashire.' Charlie James: What is your job?' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: Wildlife Photographer.' Charlie James: What are you into?' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: Wildlife Photographer.' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: What kind of birds are you into?' Charlie James: Kingfishers.' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: Kingfishers - what kind of bird is this? What are its habits?' Charlie James: Kingfishers are beautiful.' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: They live in streams and rivers. What do they feed on?' Charlie James: They feed on fish.' Charlie James: When and where do you find them?' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: Sometimes you may find them near human settlements, riverbank habitats. What do you do about these people?' Charlie James: We try to make things as pleasant as possible for them.' Charlie James: Is the world changing for Kingfisher?' BBC North East Wildlife Photographer: You do need some people like you, because we don't have many people who know the Kingfishers. It's been said that, it was almost extinct at the end of the 1960s, but now it has about ten million people in the wild. I mean it is in great danger.' Charlie James: Now is the time for us to try to make a change because you cannot just leave it alone.'"," Charlie James's book is called Kings and Queens of the Stream: Kings and Queens in the Worlds of Streams. Kings are usually males and Queens are usually females. Most Kings and Queens find their homes in woodland near streams. Kings can stand up to six feet in height. Kings feed at low water; they gather for hours at night feeding at the same time. Queens feed at high water by swimming against the current. Kings and Queens are most comfortable in their nests, often made of leaves, twigs and roots that are placed in the ground close to water."," These streams will have fish or other foods close by. Charlie is planning on taking pictures of the kingfisher before, during and after the annual migration. Charlie will travel to a local stream and a small river that runs through a forest to take pictures. Charlie likes fishing well. Charlie's sister, Beth, likes to run in the local park, where she can swim, play with a ball and enjoy the water. Charlie will use a tripod and a wide-angle zoom lens to photograph the kingfisher. He will also use a telephoto for his final shots. Charlie will bring a digital camera and a memory card.", Charlie is in a quiet place where there are not many other wildlife and his camera is steady. His picture shows the kingfisher drinking from the stream. The image is dated 4/15/09., The kingfishers live in Africa in savannas and waterways. They have a small head with thick red bill and feet covered in scales. The kingfishers can fly by raising their feet straight up while the head is pulled back so they fly in straight lines. They also have the power to swim by raising their legs first and raising them again. The kingfisher is a naturalist and wildlife photographer who loves to follow the kingfishers around the world. Charlie James likes to travel and is always ready for adventures and a good fishing trip. The kingfisher is very common in North Africa where he lives near streams and rivers. Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who has a natural and relaxed attitude to learning and enjoys photography in his free time., Charlie James is also a wildlife expert on the kingfisher. He likes to shoot pictures of them. He knows what colors are good for a good photo because he has studied them for years. The kingfisher lives near streams and rivers; feeding on fish, The kingfishers are very sensitive to changes in their environment so they often leave their nest and are on the move every day and night. This time we are observing the kingfishers on the banks at the zoo. They like to spend time with their family. They are used to having their nests near water and they like to rest in the shade so they do not suffer from the heat of the sun. Charlie James
B2," This article describes how they are made and what happens there. Studio audiences are just another common feature of television lifeand yet to many of us they remain a mysteryThe BBC is working on a number of programmes where the audience will be made visible and it is hoped audiences themselves will come up with answers to a series of interesting questions. The programme is titled Studio Audience and is a collaboration between BBC Television, the Institute of Television and Film (ITFF) and the University of Birmingham. This is the first of a series of articles based on BBC projects. What do the studio audience members do?The programme is based on the programme TV Studio Audience, a series of short documentary films on the making of television programmes and interviews with various members of the BBC's technical teams. Each programme is about seven minutes long. The programme has already been produced for two years and looks at how TV studio audience members work with other members of the BBC technical team and get along with each other.The BBC team includes members of the technical teams of programmes such as Blackadder and I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here and other programmes, and members of the BBC's creative departments including producers, directors and writers. Studio audiences get excited on game showsCosmo Landesman and ITV's Mike Leigh got the opportunity to try out some of the BBC's newest production facilities at their home studio in Birmingham. The audience of Blackadder: The Rise and Fall of the Last Witch on the Planet..."," So we sit and watch. Cosmo Landesman spent three years on the road with his team, interviewing television presenters, show directors and other specialists to get to know them. He interviewed 50 presenters, broadcasters and producers between 2010 and 2012. What do you need to know about an audience? What do you know about your audience? Cosmo Landesman says of your audience: We know nothing about our audience but we are told to trust the presenter. And what is the presenter supposed to be in a television programme? He has found out that the presenter is not the most important. The presenters who do not present a programme - or are in the audience - can still have a positive influence on the audience if they know how to show them what they're actually about. And what exactly do you want your audience to experience when watching a programme? Cosmo Landesman says: If they want to feel like they're really in the middle of the story, you need to be careful to use a few words that mean something. You can't let your audience know, that you've actually got them and yet you're being completely detached. Cosmo Landesman made a few interesting observations about the audience: He says you need to use a few simple, but important words in your text, which give your audience a sense of what it's about and how they feel at the same time. You must always include the name of the main character in your text. The author says it gives the audience a sense of who they're actually watching. Cosmo Landesman points out that there are two main parts that make up an audience: The audience's attention span and their capacity to engage with a character. Cosmo Landesman says the question of the audience is a matter of how the characters interact with them. We all have our own audience - how you want to think of your audience will determine whether you can successfully entertain them and why you..."," We want to know how well they know their business and how they get through that initial grind. Sometimes it's interesting, sometimes we can see the frustration as we see them react in the wrong way to the wrong things, but still the mystery of the studio audience remains. Let's meet them."," And so with the advent of technology we have been able to learn more about them. The audience in TV is the people who sit in the seat for the most part of the programme. Most viewers are from the audience list or the public and even though the majority of them do not watch any live programmes or participate in the programme production, they can still be seen at other times as a public gathering or a special event. But despite what many people think it is not just about that group of people who watch the programmes on television. There are many people involved at the production stages of a programme, who provide us with all the other equipment needed to have a successful programme. All of this is why the audience is so important. Cosmo Landesman"," In an investigation conducted by Cosmo Landesman there are many different elements to be found in a studio audience. How are the producers of programmes made more professional and interesting? What are the elements that make the average audience, both in television programmes and films, want to be involved in the production and what makes them not? What are the ways in which audience members get involved in the making of TV programmes? What are the different types of television audiences, for example male, female, elderly, children, working or students, urban or rural?", And we find our answers in the numbers on the screen. - Cosmo Landesman  The total number of words and their sentence length are rated on the Flesch-Kincaid Grades.," How did they make it? In the same way we watch performances, concerts and sporting events where the participants are the stars. But the truth is we do not know much about them. They don't speak to us, don't smile as we watch. We don't even really notice their movements and their faces. Cosmo Landesman: You don't say anything to them. And as for a sporting event, we often don't even hear the announcer speak to us. Cosmo Landesman: In the TV studio Cosmo Landesman: When we watch a TV programme, which often takes us all day in a room, we are not even fully in it. And what are the actors and their models doing? So it is difficult to be in the audience, and that is why we do not really understand all the actions. Cosmo Landesman: The audience is part of a show and the studio audience are the backstage performers. Cosmo Landesman: How are they treated? This is why we find it hard to understand them. Cosmo Landesman: For a show on sports there is always a studio audience. The audience is part of the show. Cosmo Landesman: What do they want? Cosmo Landesman: The audience want the same things that the actors do. Cosmo Landesman: What else do they want? Cosmo Landesman: They want to see the actor, or actor and his performance? Cosmo Landesman: Cosmo Landesman: They don't speak to them, don't smile as we watch. What else? Cosmo Landesman: They want something, a performance, something for them to have memorised. Cosmo Landesman: What do they expect? Cosmo Landesman: A performance of something they are interested in, something that makes them excited."
B2, So the school board couldn’t deny him. And just like that... Chris Greener was a Navy Seal and one of the youngest of the youngest. The BBC spoke to Chris and a Navy Seal recruit called Jake Dury about their experiences," One morning in the late '90s he was standing on the bus commuting to school when two other boys made conversation with him. They asked if he was a Marine. As their mum or dad made a comment about their weight Chris didn't say yes he didn't want to be an army man, but something else. He wasn't really sure what it was about the boys, but suddenly it dawned on him that they were just too big for their boots! He made friends with both boys and they were quickly becoming good friends. 'We looked at a pair of football boots and said ""that's just the size for us"",' said Chris. 'Then they told us which one they thought the longest would be'. Now, if the boys hadn't looked a bit ridiculous in their matching grey shirts, they would have been in the real Navy...", The teacher wasn't happy and got Chris to write down his ambitions - but then realised something else... Chris wanted to be the captain of his own ship.," After a week of joking around, Chris's parents went on the record and announced that their son was about to become a ship's officer! The world stopped. People took notice. Chris's father said it was the world turning against the country that was turning against his son. For Chris Greener, the world stopped turning."," The point was, he was getting bigger! Chris became so big he no longer recognised anyone. The school nurse was forced to put him in the school crate. He was eventually turned in to the principal. Chris Greener, who now stands five feet ten inches tall, now remembers when he went to the principal's office. The principal asked him what he wanted. The boy answered bluntly, 'I want to be an artist.' He was allowed to wear the school shirt and go on a field trip to the art museum in the city he lived in. He was also able to take home some of his paintings. Over the years he studied art and became an artist."," When the teacher started explaining the grammars, the words went from being hard to read and understand to being barely intelligible and most of the sentences were just too long. The whole text just sounded like a bunch of incoherent gibberish. 'There’s no way you’re going to get into the navy unless you can read and understand,' said the teacher. 'Because your vocabulary isn’t good enough.' He knew what the teacher meant. He had a hard time understanding half of the sentences when he tried to understand the first half of a sentence. And it took them forever to start reading - even when he got the flu. His teacher knew what she was talking about when she said that, though - he was the first of her classes. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale is a way of figuring out how easy or difficult a text is for a given level of reading ability. If the text is difficult enough for a grade level below, the text will probably be difficult for any other grade level at the same level. Most people start using it to read text they already understand but many experts also use it to help them evaluate other texts. That’s why the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Scale is so useful - to let people read and write better. If a text has a low Flesch-Kincaid Grade Score, it suggests that the writer probably doesn’t get along with the grade-level readers, which is not a good idea. When Chris and the rest of his class attempted to write this text, the grammar seemed to be pretty good. If you wanted to write a good or strong text, make sure the writer gets along with the grade-level readers, if possible."," In fact, by that age he was growing very quickly. But Chris had just started a new school, and was growing at such a rate it took them a long time to get the teacher to notice. The new school's headmaster, Martin, didn't have time for children who were being overgrown. Chris's parents tried to encourage him to join the army, but the headmaster said that even if he'd been able to fit into the army, he'd still have to live on as a child, and would have to look after an ailing grandfather. If he joined the navy he'd be able to live with his parents. His teachers were quite upset about it. So it wasn't until five months later that Mr. Greener was offered to serve in the Royal Navy, but he declined. His family did their best, but his body had grown too fast. Chris wasn't fit to be a soldier. One day, Chris, his mother and his father were leaving school to take Chris to buy candy when a policeman stopped them. Mr. Greener's parents could hardly hold him, but they decided to let Chris walk with the policeman. But the policeman said, ""No, I will give you your reward - if you become an astronaut you will be able to live at home in the village forever!"" The family wasn't able to believe the bargain. After all, the policeman had never thought about it - he was just making up a lie. The family went back home that evening, but still did not believe it. Two days later, Chris had grown even taller, and could..."
B2, What happened afterwards? many deaths and injuries there were hundreds of deaths. British general ordered his soldiers to block the exits and shoot into the crowd. As well as thousands of injuries there were hundreds of deaths, Do you know where this is set up in England? Southsea Port. Do you know what happened? India declared independence the following year. It was the first country in the British Isles to do so., All images are copyrighted. This is a photo taken from a newspaper newspaper. You can only use this photo for internal use. Image credit: Courtesy of National Museum of Civil War, Today when you see the large square on Amritsar you can see the marks left by the British. These marks are the streets where the British killed and injured the people and the square is the site of the festival.," The soldiers made the town in the middle of the night. At dawn the local people staged an emergency march and had the soldiers march over them. In 1920 a group of students from Oxford University protested the treatment of Indians, who were kept in isolation. There were many clashes and the police used tear gas. The students and the police were both jailed and sentenced to death. The students won the court case and were released after 11 years. The following passage is taken from a magazine article. During spring vacation many families go to Kashmir, or to other places where English is spoken. Most of the tourists who visit Kashmir are young American or British families, although the English language is spoken in other parts of Pakistan as well. I will describe some of the English grammar and pronunciation rules. The verb “to be” has three forms. It can be used in the present tense as a compound verb in a sentence, in the past tense or as a past participle. It is used as a direct verb with a subject. Examples are, “They are laughing.” and “The man is crying.” The verb “to be” can also be used in the imperfect tense. In this form you add a verb modifier or a verb to the form of the verb “to be”. It is used as a compound verb. You can say, “We are sleeping.” The English grammar is not very difficult, but a careful reading is probably necessary. Many young people cannot take it all in at first.", Vaisakhi is an important Hindu festival. - Wikipedia The text is in Punjabi. For this assignment we are going to practice our reading skills. Write a sentence from the text. People gathered in the public garden during the festival of Vaisakhi.," There is a lot of evidence that the violence against Indian protesters was not just by the British. However, it is clear that thousands of protesters were unarmed. There is an inquest that was carried out by India's parliament on the events from 17-18 April that is being investigated and will hopefully be reported in the coming days. The inquest is under way in Amritsar."
B2," A small flying plane that can travel even on winding roads, because you don't need to slow it down. The EN-V isn't just a two-wheeled two-seater, it's a two-wheeled trike and a trike that is a trike. It's very narrow. It comes in at 1.40m wide which makes it difficult to squeeze two people in. That said, it is extremely stylish and the concept looks very interesting. The next EN-V has a small, low-profile wheelbase and wider wheels. At the moment this is a prototype, but it's got enough of a wheel base to allow a wider wheel base. So with the right kit, and the EN-V can be made to have two wheels or four. It's also clever because you need no special gear and it's actually quite cheap to build. You only need about £80 to build. The EN-V is a good idea that has got me thinking about how much it costs to be a trike in this country. I want to be able to have my own trike in the near future, but the prices and the hassle of registering makes this rather unlikely. So that doesn't look good. The EN-V has a lot going for it. One of the problems is how much of a wheelbase it has. The trike concept is one step removed from the trike that's currently on the road. But what the EN-V is going to do is actually make it more common. The EN-V is pretty sturdy, but it would be better if the side panels were made from sturdier materials such as aluminium, because these might crack when you fall off them. Also there must be greater protection, especially if you are going to ride it on a country road. It must have enough space for the wheels and the handlebars to fit. I'm quite partial to the look of this car. I think that you could call it a two-wheeled aircraft. The..."," It has two wheels on each side, with an internal combustion engine and a large front wheel and a small rear wheel. The rear is used to hold the passenger. The internal combustion engine and power unit is under the floor. The front wheels then act like the front and rear wheels of a standard two-wheeled two-seater, the only difference being that they are much larger and they have a larger wheelbase. So this is the EN-V. You just take off and the EN-V flies away straight out of the ground. Of course the EN-V uses an internal combustion engine so it can be used on the open road or in urban situations, or if necessary it can be used for emergency situations, like when you get stuck in a muddy hole. It's designed to be an inexpensive means of transport, and that's why it's costing as little as £1,200. There's nothing built like it in the world yet, and that's because it's a new type of vehicle design. So the engineers and designers need to get to grips with the unique characteristics of this type of vehicle, and how they might work together to design a better solution. There is an EN-V at the Motoring Museum in Newbury, Berkshire, and you can take an EN-V for a spin there."," But I can't say the same of the two-wheeled versions, particularly the one with the small cabin. The cockpit is too small and the driver's seat too low which makes the space in it rather awkward."," For a while it was tempting but I decided I wouldn't be tempted, but just thought this may help those of you who are looking for a cheaper, yet more practical solution to transport. En-V Concept"," The whole thing is a hybrid of a car and a plane. In theory that's what it could be like, but you can't fit two people inside in that way. At this stage it's just one seat with the two wheels attached, and it's a rather complicated thing to take in to the city. So the EN-V is quite a small vehicle but is still capable of very impressive performance, and that's just down to the hybrid nature of the car. The hybrid nature of the EN-V means that while the engine and the wheels are separated, the power is still shared between the two. The idea of a two-seater car running entirely on a hybrid is the same idea that makes the Honda NSX so unique. The two seats that go into the hybrid are in tandem, so that the whole is a two-seater. That's quite clever and unique, not to mention quite cool. It's not just the clever hybrid nature of EN-V that makes this car different. There is also the clever design. The EN-V is a two-seater that has a sleek, slim appearance. I mean how could you go wrong with two wheels attached at a small point that gives you that extra height over the ground? That's quite clever. It's just a good looking car for city use. The engine is also in the front and that provides more leg room for one passenger, who is left with a little more freedom of movement. This design may not have been the original idea for EN-V but it's certainly good, and it could be a good idea to consider making a two-seater version of a similar car. This is a good thing, because not all cars are good for two people inside."," EN-V concept is a two-wheeled two-seater solution to urban transport

That's because this EN-V is really more like a small plane with a roof than a proper car. At the speed of 45 miles per hour, the concept is a total of 8,000 miles per hour. These motoring experts have a preview of the EN-V concept, driven by Mike Rutherford of The Telegraph Motoring."," I suppose you could say it looked and felt like an airborne mobile home. For those of you not familiar with EN-V or motorcycles with sidecar, or something similar, here's the basic story. It is a small two-wheeled two-seater which allows you to travel by a sideway seat or in the rear seat. The idea is that you have a two-wheeled vehicle which allows you to travel on both sides of the street, which seems logical. However it is not entirely without limitations. In this car one seat is behind the other, with only a space in the middle. The other seats are in the sidecar. This is the problem with GM's clever EN-V. It has two seats in the same position. There is no room for a rear seat. This will not fit in the car with rear seats and it might be a problem for some. One of the problems with the EN-V is that the sidecar is too short. To find out how the EN-V is supposed to work with car seats, take a look at this image. GM has also taken some measures to try to make the sidecar more practical for smaller cars. First of all the sidecar looks awkwardly like a sort of mini bike. Second, it cannot move backward. This is because there is a rigid frame that moves forward, like a crankshaft. For someone standing in the front of the car, and looking down at the sidecar, it looks like two wheels moving forward rather than backwards. However it is true, the two wheels move forward in opposite directions. The car's steering is therefore affected as if the front wheels are two front wheels of a larger..."

B2," Somehow, the animals might survive, and humans would never be discovered. There would be wild animals who might hunt humans. Other areas might thrive with their own unique natural environment. This might be a harsh environment, but for some people living there it might be paradise. This chapter would be an interesting one for our kids, because they could see how humankind's disappearance might affect other places. In this book, the book also offers a prediction of what humans would look like in a distant future. I will tell you what some of these elements look like. The book is called The World Without Us."," There are some fascinating observations in that book. Let's read the passage from section 9.9.1 to get the details: 9.9.1 If the Earth's population decreased to just four million people, what might happen? There will be an outbreak of the cholera in New York. If New York loses the ability to clean up waste, it will become a dumping ground for sewage. New York's trash will have to be transported thousands of miles to cities like Paris, and it will create pollution. New York's people might not even have enough energy to cook their food, or they might have to eat raw food. New York might lose the ability to control the amount of rainfall because it cannot regulate its own water drainage. New York would lose all of its water. All of the city will be waterlogged. The city would be forced to abandon the area. The country will be in the grip of a huge famine. A new world order will replace the current one."," As it turned out, New York survived even though its population disappeared. What is it that we take for granted, and which makes our world so beautiful? It's not the things that we think about the most - it's what we don't think about. A story of science, of the mind, of why we do things the way we do. A must-read, a must-have for anyone interested in thinking about our world and the world around us."," If we humans, on average, are living out our last 50 years of existence, we could expect our last two centuries to be numbered as Earth is no longer inhabited."," I hope you enjoy this activity: 
Read the passage. Do you need help understanding the passage? No, but you can watch the video if you like
What would happen if our planet was suddenly to disappear? It would start to slowly fade away"," The first sentence of that chapter reads: ""...If humans are to disappear, New York will remain a great city for the foreseeable future."""," In the first chapter he describes the various characteristics of New York. First he notes the variety in different types of buildings. Then he describes the differences in the number of streets, roads, and different types of land use. He describes a number of contrasting geographical features of New York, including: different types of building, types of roads and how the city used its land. He also identifies the main sources of pollution in the city. Finally, he identifies the major transportation mode. He then describes the number of buses, trains, cars, trucks, pedestrians and tourists. Weisman also identifies the major sources of pollution. First he suggests that if New York were to disappear, the main source of pollution would be human industry. He then uses the example of oil industry to illustrate his point. He notes that oil used to be cheap, but is now more expensive. Weisman concludes that the main source of pollution in the city would be the cars, trucks, and trains. Weisman also identifies how New York uses its land. In other words, he identifies how the city uses its land for specific purposes. In this case Weisman shows that New York uses its land for two main purposes: housing and tourism. Then he goes on to describe the different types of housing.

B2," It was in November. After all, it was just a matter of a few days before it was December, and we would already be spending so much time at home without even leaving the door closed. It was in November. It was cold that day, the temperature hovered around a low forty degree degrees Fahrenheit. It was quite chilly. We had left our house that morning, leaving our family home behind with the promise that we would return after some time, but when we walked into the valley to find out what had been left behind for us, it was quite unlike what we had expected. We were stunned. We would never have expected that anyone would leave without not leaving us any food. We were not even going to return to that home to go see what was left behind. We went back inside, searching through the debris for food. It was as though the night had passed without even knowing it. Just minutes after leaving, there were signs of chaos, people everywhere, chattering and running away from everywhere. It was very confusing. The storm had left its mark on the valley, and the storms that had followed had left their mark on it too. There were still signs of their presence. I was just as surprised as anyone. We walked towards our main gate, with our hands clutched in our pockets, as if we had no choice but to get to the truck. It was like we were in the midst of some sort of nightmare. I am not sure why anyone would leave us behind. The storms had certainly made it very difficult for us to stay home. We found a few small crates of the things left behind. We were very disappointed, and were quite upset. We left very disappointed. It was quite like looking in the face of a dream, and just wondering how the residents of our home had survived through the storms. It was quite..."," On the very day we heard the news about the storm, we knew we had to make immediate escape. There was no time for planning or for any further delay. Our valley looked to have run its course and we had to act quickly."," We knew it was coming, and we knew what it was, but we did not know what it might become.  The storm was approaching like a thief in the night. It came up from the mountains, and was threatening to envelop us from every angle. It was a bad storm, and we were frightened, but we could not run. There was nothing to run to, and we could not hide. The storm was coming, the storm was on its way. So, we put on our brave clothes and got ready to run away. We were terrified, and we knew not what to do. But we didn't know it was the storm, or what was it about. That night, we sat alone at home. We were unable to find any food, and we were very worried, and in a hurry. What can I do? What can I do now? We sat down by the window and tried to think. We could not understand anything. We just sat there, and we waited for what would happen. A little at a time, the storm gradually diminished until it was gone. We sat in our chairs and looked out the window. The light of the street was getting on us and we knew that it was getting on us too. But then the storm was back on again, and it came on faster. We had nothing to do, so we sat there quietly watching the storm and the light and waiting for something to happen. We waited for a long time. It was becoming almost impossible to sit there without looking out of the window. Finally, we knew, and we knew it would be the last storm. The last storm would be gone, and we would find out why. Then we heard someone say something and looked out the window. It was the front door and they looked inside, and they asked us to come in. As we walked inside, we could see that they had already gone. It was the morning of January 1st and there was no sign of the storm. We looked out at the rainy sky and knew that it had not arrived. We sat in our chairs and thought all the..."," The night before the first of October, the darkest night of the year, the storm began. By the time we had started using our generators and the rain stopped, the damage was immense. Everything had been destroyed and the valley floor was now covered in mud and rocks. We knew it was coming because it had come in so early and with such force. It was in a very bad way because the storm had swept down from the hills and was moving in at a very fast speed. One hundred kilometers an hour. Incredible! And then the rain! The rain had begun falling from the clouds, and it was like rain at the bottom of the ocean. There was no sound but the water was very powerful. There were no signs of thunder but the lightning was terrifying. It was coming at us like the rain and the water was crashing down the road like a mountain. We stood in our valley in total silence. There was no sound. We just stood there and waited for the rain to stop. Then we had to jump over a huge rock in the middle of the street just so we didn't get swept away. We had just turned a corner in the street when we heard a scream and suddenly we all knew the storm was upon us. It started very high into the sky and very quickly it went down, very, very quickly, very quickly. Incredible! It was the quickest thing we had ever seen. We were in shock. We couldn't believe we were actually there! It was the worst...",We used the hills as cover from the rain to keep a shelter of water from the sky . At that time we thought the hills were not as dangerous as they were later. We did not know that it was a sign that the year was approaching its end.," In the countryside of the valley, we had been living in the hilltop valley below for three decades. After living there for about fifteen years, they were on the verge of dying. In the midst of it all, their lives took a turn for the better when they saw a new city at their doorstep. The new town was located between the valley and the mountain tops; the old town grew over the years to a new city. The valley, however, was not going to survive the storm. Their lives were put into danger as the storms rolled in."," There was no telling when, if or where the storm could strike. The valleys were empty until the mountains and forests came to fill them, then they went on to have their rainforest as well as the mountain forests. What we experienced was a time of peace and quiet, as it was a time when we could rest, as the danger was far away."
B2," She called Seymour as he sat on the sofa. She said: 'I want you to meet her.' Mrs. Cohen said, 'Good for you.' 'Mademoiselle, I am not. I'm no longer Miss Rita Cohen. My name's Marion; my mother is not Miss Cohen. I'm only seven.' Marion said she was Marion and it was her birthday party. 'What a delight.' Mrs. Cohen said, 'Is this Marion?' Mrs. Cohen said: 'Yes. She came just now.' Marion replied, 'Excuse me. It's only me. She is here on the other side of the hall.' Miss Rita Cohen said: 'Excuse me. You can't do that. You can't take Miss Marion!' Marion said, 'Excuse me. I am Marion. I want my things. Get out of here!' Mrs. Cohen said, 'No. Marion wants her things. And I think you must do this.' Marion said, 'Excuse me. I'm Marion. Miss Rita Cohen is here. She wants her things.'"," Miss Rita Cohen was a regular visitor to Mr. Seymour. A little boy with a green umbrella was waiting for her. He noticed the boy in green and pretended not to know the little girl at first, but later he noticed she was a girl."," Her little sister Marie was laughing. Ms. Cohen also had a dog that looked like her but was not the same breed. There was no way Marie had the same size as Miss Rita Cohen either. Miss Rita Cohen claimed to be a relative or neighbor of the girl's mother who died when she was a baby, while Marie was the grand-daughter of the woman who was a pet. While the girls weren't sisters."," She walked in carrying a book on her little black bag.

'It's all right' said Miss Rita as she entered the room. He looked around and saw the chair on the bed and the table at the end of the room full of books. 

'Who is this girl?' he asked. Her name was Miss Rita and she was a book saleswoman. 'You want a book, Miss Rita?' she asked.

'Yes,' said Miss Rita, 'I am looking for books for my sister and two brothers. Can I buy one?'

She nodded and disappeared into the passageway to the back. Seymour and the boy stared at the empty chair.

'Do you have some money?' said the boy to the older man. 'Yes. You can buy a few more books for me,' said Seymour as he went into the passageway and came out with twenty dollars in his pocket and a box of crayons. 

They went back to the door and the boy asked, 'Can I get one more book for this?'

'Yes,' said Miss Rita. She bought a single story book. The boy walked away and turned around to look at Miss Rita. 'Don't buy the novel,' he whispered. 'You know it is full of lies and bad morals.'

'Don't be such a little boy!' Miss Rita scolded. 'How much more money can I get out of you?'

'One hundred dollars,' said the boy. 'Only $100.' Miss Rita was in a hurry and said, 'How much more?' The boy's fingers were crossed nervously.

'Ten dollars.' 'Now you can get one more,' said the boy, giving him 10 dollars. 

'All right. Here are ten dollars.'

The girl was surprised as she watched Mr and Mrs Seymour leave. 'You can have a hundred dollars for yourself,' said the boy, and went on his way."," She told Mr. Seymour that she was the older sister of Marie and that she was sent to the school to help her in the study. She claimed that she could speak German very well and that she knew how to read German and write in German. She said she could help Seymour with the French homework. He listened to her with a quizzing ear and thought that she might be a good person, although she was so small. The more Seymour spoke to her, the closer he came to realising that she was really not as nice as she pretended to be.", Miss Rita Cohen wanted something to eat from the kitchen and Seymour smiled at her and then offered her a bowl of eggs in a small bowl. Marie's mother was sitting at the table while Maria smiled and ate her eggs without a care in the world., He had her as a regular student and she often used the term 'my student'. It was the same as when she claimed to be eight years older than her mother. In her eyes he must have been an old man who could not care about her. Miss Rita Cohen was a regular student at his school.
B2," There are three ways of working with styles of fabrics. By the way, it's important to remember to put your neck and shoulders into the design. The more vertical fabric, the more dresses the cut away, making a short neck and high shoulders the perfect style. Be warned, one cut away is too much. The fabric should stay in the middle of the back of the neck, but one arm should still be visible at the front. For example, a dress with two cut away arms and one arm left at front would be one that has too much vertical fabric. He prefers one arm to the front and one arm on the back. To make a dress that is just beautiful, the most important thing is to put the right amount of fabric. Too much and the dress will be too full and too long, not just that, it will look bulky on the body. The most important thing is to fit the length of the dress to the figure you want to portray. When you measure the measurements of your body and bust, don't forget to keep the hem, the neckline, and the sleeves the same. They should not be in the same proportions.

For an experienced music teacher a child's need will be identified right away, whether at school or in private practice, by the following indicators:   A very keen interest in music. A special talent for playing a musical instrument, singing, or any other form of creative expression. Interest in musical history and music theory. A strong imagination. A deep respect for life and the environment. A special interest in learning. Attitude, attitude and behaviour. A willingness to work hard and persevere. How to be a music teacher What you will need:  Experience in the teaching of music or singing. A wealth of knowledge about the development of children from the age of a few months to 16. A keen appreciation for all aspects of the child's development. Knowledge about music theory and music performance. Knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of many different musical instruments. Knowledge of the structure and construction of all musical instruments. Know the methods of teaching, including music notation (which is discussed in later lessons), as well as how to keep track of how far a child has progressed. Knowledge of the stages of musical growth. The development of a child from the birth of their baby to their adolescence is considered to be an intensive process which should be approached with patience and understanding.

She's worried about a possible loss of her musical talent, and the loss will be even more costly if she fails to take measures to address it quickly. She is struggling to work with her daughter's behaviour in her home and is very concerned about her musical talent."," It is therefore important for parents to be aware of what they can expect from their child's development from this early stage onwards, and to develop plans for their own development as well. Specialist music schools are able to give parents a better understanding of the music-making process, and of how to help their child develop the skills to follow their heart.

She looked me in the eye and said, ""well, she was an only child, she was quite unique."" She went on, and said that she remembered her daughter Anne going to college with the greatest actress that ever lived. Anne's husband was a scientist and they were really close. One time Dorothy Hodgkin asked me, and this was before I knew Anne was her daughter, ""who was this girl?""  And I said ""oh she was just Dorothy Hodgkin's daughter.""

In my childhood I remember that we always had a picture of her on our wall. I always knew that her biography would be interesting., When asked why I am writing a biography I answer: because I am her biography. I have been asked why it should be my biography first I answer: because I wrote the first biography of Hodgkin. I have been asked if my biography is worth reading I answer: I can tell you I am not. My story is the same everywhere but the people who read it know it is not true. But even that won't stop the Hodgkin Institute from saying their biography will be Dorothy Hodgkin's biography.," Dorothy Hodgkin is a woman scientist Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983, and is probably best known for the discovery of the Hodgkin lymphoma of childhood T-cell Leukemia"," The word count is determined by total words, the sentences are determined by total sentences, the syllables are determined by total syllables.

C1," The new criteria include emotional intelligence The new rules for work are changing We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are or by our training and expertise but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. The rules for the workplace are changing and people need to change with them. To succeed in this new economy, to maintain or increase your career, to remain competitive, to keep you ahead of the pack, you need a certain type of character: the kind that will help you overcome hurdles, that will make you strong in all kinds of situations. A successful professional does not necessarily have the perfect education or the perfect training. Emotional intelligence is the key to success. The key to success is not necessarily the skills that you possess or the hard work you put in, it's the type of character that is built up and nurtured. So why do people have such different opinions about what emotional intelligence is and what it means to be emotional and intelligent? The most important thing to know about Emotional Intelligence (EI) is that it is a set of 'people skills'. The ability to read others, to think, to act, to feel, and to make decisions with others. It has the power to change your mindset - and eventually your way of doing things. And it's one of those skills that can be practised - not in a 'heroic' sense, like in a martial art, but in a practical way. It can also be practiced by everybody, not just by geniuses. So if you want to succeed, you have to understand that emotional intelligence is the 'key'. If you want to be happy or motivated or optimistic, you have to have an emotional intelligence. If you want to be more assertive, more flexible and more empathetic, then you have to have good emotional intelligence. But the skills we can learn aren't enough. If you want to be a good leader, you have to improve and develop emotional intelligence. If you want to be a good leader,..."," You may also find this essay helpful: Daniel Goleman's book ('Emotional Intelligence: The Key to Success', 2003, Oxford) is worth reading. Goleman's key message is that we are judged according to the way we treat ourselves and each other. If we are not careful, the people skills that will make you the best at your job may end up undermining everything you are good at. How can we find the answers to these questions, and improve our emotional intelligence? By listening to and responding to others in a compassionate and empathetic way. To be empathic, we must be sensitive to the feelings of others and we have to have the ability to see the other person in a whole different light. You can develop this skill by reading a book, watching a movie or even just sitting in quiet time and reflecting on your own behaviour. You may find it helpful to make a list of the things you see in others that you tend to overlook in yourself. These may include physical problems, family issues and personality traits that are good qualities to look for in a workplace. There may also be others that you find to be worth overlooking and you can make a mental note of these in a list. One good example is when someone appears to be under a lot of stress, which you would probably not pay attention to because you usually think that they have plenty of time left in the week. For more practice, think about what you would do if you were in that person's shoes. This might help you feel compassion for your own situation. There are some books and videos that you can consult online. A key example is one about listening to empathetic listeners. The following video demonstrates how listening to others can help us achieve a better sense of empathy. This video is made by the University of Reading in the UK.

A How often do you have to say good-bye to clients and customers?

The book: D Goleman's The Rules for Work The book: D Goleman's The Rules for Work   Start of the story: 'Two years ago, when I started my work as an elementary school teacher, I was asked by my supervisor for an evaluation of my teaching practice. To do this, I had to write a letter to my former students and tell them I wanted to do something different to help them learn English better. It was the first step in the new education that I was going to offer.' I was a middle school teacher of the standard curriculum in the East Timor. But the language of that education had not changed. I was told that there were five basic skills I had to focus on: vocabulary, reading, writing, speaking and listening. However, these five competencies were not enough to learn English well. One of the reasons for this, according to D Goleman, is that the people in charge of the education system had not understood that every student is different. 'We should understand that the students are different, our teaching style should be different, teaching strategies should be different, and materials should be different,' he explained. 'We should understand that the students are different, our teaching style should be different, teaching strategies should be different, and materials should be different.'

C1," Well the first thing you should consider is the radio is to be used for. Do you want to make it sound only when you get up? Is it just to wake you up or just to make yourself more alert? You would be better to use it only as your waking aid. So if you want to use the radio as your alarm clock it will be best to choose one that has dual alarms. You can set the alarm to a short time duration or you can even adjust its setting to be as long as it is going to take to get up. Another important thing to choose a clock radio is the volume of the volume should not be too high nor too low. The volume should be just a comfortable level to help you go to bed and waking. In general, a good radio alarm clock radio will be between 90 and 120 DB. This is the average noise level during sleep. A good clock radio also has many functions, such as dual alarms and adjustable volume."," Here are a few suggestions:  Watch a clock with an analog design. Look for designs that are either analog or digital. If you're trying to avoid the digital watch, look for analog designs. Look for a long life clock. Watches which run on batteries should be able to last over a couple of years if you care about your watch. Look for a watch that comes with a long warranty. Ask for help from an established brand. Look for a mechanical watch. If you want to look smart, look for a mechanical watch. If you want a classic, you need look no further than the mechanical watch. Choose an analog clock. If you really want to watch the clock, a analog clock makes the most sense. You may want to opt for a digital clock. It's up to you."," If you have a large family with many adult children, perhaps a separate clock radio may be beneficial. For larger families and the elderly, a central clock radio may be the best bet. It is possible to customize the alarm clock to your exact needs. What are the benefits of a radio? You can listen to the news, current affairs or music. You can have the radio ready at all times. You do not have to stand at the radio. If you need to, you can hang the radio over the toilet. You do not have to stick to one station. It is a good time to get up quickly. But not too early. The alarm should be clear but not too loud. Listen to the radio in the morning."," The Alarm. The Alarm Radio is an excellent choice. It sets an alarm for all the other clocks in your house. It also plays a pleasant musical tune. When it rings, it encourages you to get out of bed and for the first few minutes, it makes you look forward to getting up. And when the alarm goes off, it is a bit disconcerting. It means you cannot get out of bed and that the rest of the day might have to wait. But eventually it seems to make a difference and you find yourself lying back in bed, dreaming of the sunrise or of something quite pleasant. It is a good way of getting up in the morning and making yourself feel rested. It seems that the sound of the Alarm can wake you up and this is probably because it is something that you look forward to. And you find it enjoyable to listen to the pleasant music. It is probably what many of us will choose to wake up to rather than other kinds of alarms. But you will be sure to enjoy it even if you are only looking forward to the music. The following is a list of things that you should consider before you buy the Alarm Radio: It is worth the money It is portable This is a great gift for birthdays. If the money is tight this is an excellent choice! So, you would think that the Alarm Radio might be worth getting. But before you decide, read the following: Be aware that you will need a power supply. The Alarm Radio doesn't have any battery or internal energy. But it is still worth a look if your house is completely off the grid. This means that the radio will charge when you go to sleep and when you turn it on in the morning. In which case, you will not have to worry about running the radio at night or in the morning. If you live in the country, your..."," A good radio should:  1. be a convenient way of giving us the time. 2. be of good quality. 3. have a good sound quality. 4. be easy of operation. In addition, 5. it should be low in price. There are several well-known brands in the market, but they all have something in common - they are designed after the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference), which is an internationally recognised standards. The Radio Debutants are designed according to the CEFR and will soon be in stores. There is no such thing as the worst radio - this is only a matter of personal taste. So, what do you think of the Radio Debutants?"," The sound is measured by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scale which can test whether it is an alarm clock that helps you get out of bed. You may want to hear the sound that you hear when you hear the radio, rather than one that is too loud and distracting. Flesch-Kincaid Scale (Grade Level):  Total words  Total sentences   Total syllables 50 words, or 750 total words, or 1,500 Total sentences, or 3,000 Total syllables, or 5,000"," The answer to this question is a little complicated. The key is in the choice of your external means of getting out of bed. Use the radio to give yourself an alarm. If you hear the beat of the alarm clock, get out of bed.  In most cases, the clock radio can be found in the family room with all the other family members. There is a radio in most rooms in the house, in the master bedroom, in the hallway and where ever else we have a set of switches that control the running of the internal electric devices that operate the external devices. The radio is usually turned on, even if the clock is not.  You will usually hear a repeating message in the radio saying you have five minutes to get ready before the alarm clock rings.  This helps you to remember what you need to do in the morning, which you will have time to do right before you listen to the beat of the alarm clock.  On some radio stations you may have an individual beep when you make the last attempt to get out of bed.    One reason for the beep is for you to understand that there is only a little time left and you need to hurry up and get out of bed.     There are other external means, such as the alarm clock itself, but they can lead to confusion. They can be placed in several places in the house, which can be confusing to the family members and cause you to lose yourself in the confusion.    In the beginning, only two external means are needed. One is the radio for giving you an alarm. The other is the clock radio. If you choose the clock radio, you can simply plug it in and turn on the device. If you are using the..."
C1," What is life without summers? Well, it can be a little like the summer without trees. There is no summer without trees. And without trees you can’t have a summer. And summer is such a good thing. Summer is a wonderful time. Summer brings flowers, joy and light. But you have to plant a tree. That isn’t an easy thing to do. The struggle is real. It is about trying to save your tree, to keep it from being chopped down and make sure that the tree can survive. I started growing trees as a child. As a boy growing up in the early 70s. When the woods were unspoiled and green, when they were filled with fresh forest, the trees were just magnificent. But they disappeared and they were gone forever. And we were left with the green forest, a beautiful green forest and we were left with our beautiful green and bright green trees. They were gone but they had been there forever. I remember sitting in the green forest and thinking about the trees. I remember thinking about how we loved them. I remember thinking about the beauty of the trees. How they grew up, how fast they grew, how beautiful they were. I think about them as I write this."," I was in postgraduate teaching at Oxford, at the University of Dundee, and on visits to Oxford I had the opportunity to work with my great-uncle George Porterrit (deceased). He was an avid bird-watcher and one of the finest naturalists in our time. He would take me out every Sunday when I was in his company, to observe the local birds. On one particular day, I saw a woodland fly, a ground-nestled form of monarch butterfly. It was a bright yellow with a greenish centre. It flew across the grass, between the leaves of a tree that was growing beside me, and then disappeared into the tree. I think it had just made its nest in that particular tree. After watching it, I went to look at the ground beneath the tree and there I discovered it was a ground-nesting monarch butterfly. I started to search for it with the idea that I should find it on my own, probably by the second or third visit. But it didn’t happen. What surprised me was that no butterfly lay on the ground beneath the tree. There were two or three large ones all around. When I asked my great-uncle what the difference was, he told me that it was not a ground-nestling monarch butterfly, but a species of butterfly that lays eggs in the ground and which has not been able to fly. They don’t live as long. They take three years to mature, and they are able to only fly three to four hours, after which they die. One of the things that surprised me, as it turns out, is that these two or three large butterflies are probably the only ones left in the area. There are still many other species which they have completely disappeared from. Some of them might be rare, so it may be difficult to find them again. What surprised me about the..."," Not in New Zealand or indeed in Australia, perhaps the world. But I did feel in my mind that perhaps I was born to live somewhere with a little green - a small piece of earth in my hands."," My parents had to raise me while I was still in the home. 

When they left for work the school day was a time to study. No, not for my studies but for my books. My books were my only toys, my only playmates, and my only entertainment. I spent an entire day reading the same book, as only one book could fill my time. I was completely engrossed and when my parents returned home from work I would find them studying or reading the same book with their eyes turned towards me, waiting impatiently. 

One day I was watching TV one evening when they were discussing a recent TV show about a British prime minister who was found to be suffering from severe apnea. I didn’t notice that my attention had been completely diverted because I was engrossed in reading, and I was so engrossed that I left the TV set completely unaware that I had been watching something.

Then the tv screen went dark, and my parents walked in on me, noticing I was still there. I immediately understood why. “How dare you read so much when the television is on?”

“Yes sir, I beg your pardon sir,” I replied, still reading the same book. 

“And why can’t you just turn the television off?”

“Because I like to watch it.”

The next day I began to notice that I could no longer read the same book that I had been reading for the longest time. There was no such book. The first book on the new table was the second one, then the third and so on. No, the book that I could no longer sit and enjoy reading, no longer was a book. It was the pages of newspaper clippings. I started to be disenchanted with reading. The television had replaced the books. 

When the TV stopped working, I turned it off by turning off the power. This was all simple, simple enough for children. The power went out. I shut the light off. When I turned it back on there was a black screen. There was no more television. It was like a new beginning and all was well. The children who had..."," Because I was a university student studying environmental and conservation science and the local authority was giving me the opportunity to do an internship. It was the mid-70s and New Zealand was emerging out of a period of economic depression and national crisis. It was a very turbulent time. I had an opportunity to get out and explore New Zealand and I wanted to do a job on the environment and sustainability issues. One day I got on a plane to the country and then went out to meet with local land conservation officers. On their recommendation, I got a job with the National Conservation and Forestry Authority as a specialist in forestry. The next day was the first day of the internship and there was a conference on forest policy and forestry planning. In other words, what policy are we going to take to deal with New Zealand’s forest reserves and how are they going to be managed? How are we going to manage our forest reserves? I was asked a question about the forestry planning process and what it took to get there. And on a practical level I had been asked whether or not there was anyone else in my company with knowledge of forestry. I thought to myself I couldn’t be the only one and decided to apply for that position. So, I walked to the end of the hallway and made a phone call to my company and said I wanted that position on forestry planning. There was a long telephone call and a lot of hellos and goodbyes and I knew that my chances were slim. So, I applied to the position and I got the job. I didn’t get the job. But I never did find out for sure. I thought it was a really strange period of my life because I had an internship for about three months. After I moved to New Zealand, I thought to myself I might have worked on forestry for many, many years. The..."," It was the longest period of my life. I read all my life because I wasn’t interested in the news. I would sit at home with a small black and white television, read poetry books and look at the pictures. In my teenage years I got involved in politics and became a member of the Labour Party. I read The Catcher in the Rye. When I arrived in college, I read more of Dickens. I think I probably read more Dickens because Dickens’s sentences were not that complicated. They were simple. I always wanted to read more books because of the way they are written. The writer of The Catcher in the Rye writes simple sentences. His sentences always have the word “But” in them. It is a trickier trick. I wanted to read more books because of that but I had an aversion to complicated sentences. I am now reading more novels, including The God Of Small Things. At the moment I have two children and one grandchild. They have a lot of fun. I also have a cat and a dog. I am not a rich man. I am a father. I hope I can have an old age."," There was only one, and it happened to be one I remember well. I was a teenager in New Zealand when the first half of the 1960s. I had had a very active youth, and I had played cricket for my school and for New Zealand. I had taken to fishing and to birdwatching. I had also discovered the power of the mind and the power of nature when I started to become active in the community, and it was in that, that I met Dan. I married him in 1960 and we had a son, Jonathon. We bought a small piece of land on a hill on the outskirts of the city. We were in the middle of the New Zealand wine growing season and the weather was fine. The sun was bright and the sky was blue and white. This was a time of intense peace and quiet. The children would go on the swing. We had horses for ploughing. We grew food for the family. I remember the smell of the tomatoes on the vine and the smell of new wine. It was a lovely time to be young. The children were happy and the couple were active with the community. So, when the next summer was approaching, it was not a surprise that Dan and I were thinking of taking up a new life. So, we bought our first house in the middle of New Zealand. And, as we left the house and started walking towards our new house we met a man by the roadside. His name was Dan. I recognised him at once, but it wasn’t until we spoke to him that I realised that we had much more in common than I realised. We had the same passion for nature. He had a small garden filled with lovely flowers and fruit. His flowers were bright and cheerful. There was no mistaking his enthusiasm. ‘My wife and I are very happy. We enjoy the peace and quiet in this country,’ he told me."

In the early 1990s, in the US, a large group of poor people of African-American descent was facing a sudden, violent and unexpected decline in their living standards. As one result, they were facing a loss of hope. They feared that their former self, a life of working and working hard, would not survive in the new economy and there was a loss of identity. People in these households who did not work and lived in poverty became homeless or had difficulty finding affordable housing in the area. When the news spread to them that the US government had announced a tax cut on rich people in the form of a $700% tax cut for the super-rich (the wealthy who were earning $750,000 a year or more) on May 1, 2002, they were upset. They feared that in the new economy the super-rich would be able to live luxurious and secure lives. They decided to fight for their rights. In many ways the story above is like the story of the poor people of America who lived in poverty during the 1990s. The people are living in the same situation in the present as of late. They are anxious to fight for their rights to equal citizenship. The people were also concerned about their rights to a decent living and a normal life. The rich were unfairly taxed. They were concerned about the loss of their lifestyle and living standards. And they feared that their own lives would not be secured in the new economy. The super rich, who are earning $750,000 a year or more, will lose their income. And their income will probably be taxed even further by the new US government and the world community. In the new economy, a person will never be rich. However, if there is no regulation for the international financial system, it can become unstable. In the 21st Century, the rich people need..."
C1," These often come from strays and they’ve brought us some wonderful animals over the years. So today at lunchtime as a visitor was brought along a small kitten who appeared to be in discomfort. I asked the other woman if she could help. She nodded her head and brought me a small plastic bag and some small, soft flakes which she said were a good food source for them. It looked like what was inside the bag was a small kitten with its hindquarters down and unable to move. I handed it to the worker so she could look after it. This is all the kitten had to eat that day. On the way back to the car my husband Derek thought about it and couldn’t make himself believe he wouldn’t be the father of this little one. He picked the kitten up and brought it up and sat in his lap. I didn’t expect him to do this so kindly. But I do think I will take the kitten home to feed to it. Thank goodness we have a good support network in Somerset so everything seems to work out in our house of dreams."," The most common rescue is from stray cattle. But sometimes the animals we’ve rescued include other animals, for example cows are taken to us for calving problems, or when they’re old. Other times, it’s been dogs. We now have seven dogs and several cats. One of the cats was born with a lump in her brain and died shortly after. I decided she might have a brain tumour and had her put under a microscope but she was found not to have any signs of anything wrong. I also brought another baby calf to see if the lump was there."," In my opinion, we’re not an unsympathetic people. When we adopted a goat, the puppy was left to me. I had no choice but to feed him."," At the dairy we take home every week a few of the cows, with the rest feeding on hay. We live in a converted property by the dairy on a small plot, and I work in the office at weekends. In these five years I’ve worked from dawn until dusk and at every hour of the day I’m responsible for at least one sick animal. We’ve all lived to make a living by farming livestock and we’re no longer looking after them on the farm. On a sunny spring morning the cows will be brought up to the farm to graze. For my husband Derek and I this is the time of year when the farm will open the doors to the public to enjoy our cattle. So as I stumble around the dairy and clean the stalls for the first time, I’m reminded that it’s not just the cows that are worth looking after. It’s the animals’ lives too. The cows are the farm’s most valuable asset but we have some of the animals that give the farm its unforgettable charm. They’re the dogs, the cats, the chickens and the goats. My husband Derek is a very special dog. A black Labrador who’s been in his family for 45 years. His love for the animals isn’t just limited to the cows but extends to any of the animals he keeps at the farm. He loves to get into anything he can with the animals. He also loves animals of all kinds and is an absolute devoted pet owner. He and his wife, the lovely Doreen, run a farm called Cotswold Safari where they take in sick animals, animals that are either too old or too sick to be kept at the farm and where they feed them their home away from home. It’s a lovely programme, which we have supported since the day we got married. They raise cotswold calves, and puppies, which are sold to farms all over the country. I’m really glad we got married on a farm, because I love cotswold and I’m inspired by it every time I see it on film. If you come..."," Now, on our dairy farm there are four sheep and one goat, including two of the animals that came from a... Read more... and share with me about your day with me."," We’ve had them all – goats, rats, guinea pigs, chicks, puppies, and now this cute rabbit. The rabbit, which the farm is called, is a female greyhound rabbit. She was brought up to me at two months and was now a year old when we decided to bring her up. But now when I get up the rabbit is always gone and even though I’m sure she will find her way, she never seems to leave. There is a hole in the concrete slab in the corner of the barn which my husband says is her den. I hope she is in there somewhere. I try to look in her den in the morning when she wakes up and then I look in the hole in the corner, but it is gone. I’m so sorry. I’m sure she’s missing. Oh, do not let her get lost!’ the mother said loudly."," Last week we had one of our cows die from a broken leg.’ 
 
 We will be bringing the dairy cows up to the new building after Easter so they are able to get used to the new environment."
C1," I have published six books, of which, I do not recall one... No idea how this works, but I am delighted to say, no review of my book had had any effect on their sales. Publisher B As for the reviews, well, you don't get much for your money when all you get is a little headway, although the reviews are essential to some publishers, they are definitely not essential for others. Publisher C I think reviewers are important for publishing - they are, after all, the ones who tell the public what they think of a particular book, and they may be the only people to do that for an author. Publisher D It comes down to whether the reviews are useful, so if you know your book works or not. Publisher E I think the book does not need the reviews. Publisher F I don't think the reviews are very useful. Publisher G I don't really care about the reviews, as long as they succeed."," It is the second most important part after advertising (if the publisher is in a good position, which is often the case).   A leading publisher said that in the world of publishing, a book review can be just as important or more important than advertising because they help to drive sales in many countries. If a book is not popular when it comes out, we do not have to publish it. Publisher B You cannot go wrong with the reviews. A well written review can be even more important than advertising. The reviews help to drive sales in many countries. Publisher C As a publisher, you cannot afford not to have good reviews for your books. It is vital to have good reviews for the company and the author. It is one of the most important things you should do for the company. Publisher D They believe reviews have their downfalls. In the world of publishing, there are no bad reviews. Any review can be good. But a publisher has to consider all aspects when making a decision about whether or not to use a review or not. Publisher E There are good and bad reviews. But if a publisher is happy with the reviews, they can be very persuasive. They have the ability to set the agenda."," They determine if a book is read - if it has potential - but the biggest influence on the book's success as a sell-out is the author's opinion, as the opinions of other reviewers matter much less. Publisher B Books sell more successfully when they're well reviewed. Books sell well because people want to buy something interesting. They sell even better if the author has some idea of the subject but they still need to be something they can relate to, or they might find them irritating. Publisher C Reviews make books look good on the cover. If they do, they'll read better - that's what really matters. Publisher D Books sell better in print, with the same review policy. Most publishers are aware of the role reviewers play, but there is no one-size-fits-all formula. Publisher E Books with little review power but good content sell better in the local environment."," They bring readers attention to the book and provide a taste for what the books will entail. They also increase sales by creating a buzz about it and giving people a first taste of what it will taste like as they open the book. It makes them more interesting than a bare book. Publisher B If readers were completely unbiased, they would not be interested in negative reviews. Readers tend to trust the first book they come across and this is largely what books are about. If the book is a hit and the reviewers say it is good, many more will want to have that experience of buying a book. Publisher C Positive reviews actually attract more sales. Negative reviews do less harm than good reviews. Negative reviews help sell the book. Publisher D Positive reviews tend to bring more attention to the book than negative reviews, but this comes at a price. Publisher E Positive reviews are helpful, but they do not have to be an element of your list of requirements. Publisher F Negative reviews are helpful and they do not have to be an element of your list of requirements. Aim to create three reviews out of every one book - two positive reviews and one negative review. Publisher G Negative reviews do more harm than help."," They show readers a view of a book that we want to buy. They also let us know if a book has been well reviewed on the Internet or elsewhere. If I had a child who wanted to read a book I might say to them, ""Is this well-reviewed?"" Publisher B Reviews are very important. If the book has been well reviewed online, the publisher can tell you whether the book will be a success in print or not. Publisher C Our books sell better when reviews go well. If the book has not been well-reviewed on the Internet, it won't sell very well. Publisher D Well-reviewed books sell better because they are recognised. Publisher D"," The more we can find good reviews, the better. The only books which publishers consider worth publishing are those whose reviews are well written and high-rated.  Publisher B Reviews have no impact. They don't. However, reviews can boost sales in certain cases. Publisher C Reviews boost sales a little bit. Sometimes. Publisher D Reviews can boost sales a lot. They can't boost sales in the short term, but sometimes in the long term. Publisher E Reviews can boost sales by around 10-50%. There is one exception to this rule, which is publisher E. They won't publish books until reviews are above 3.6 on the Flesch-Kincaid scale, which is achieved after six months. Publisher F Reviews are worth nothing. They can sometimes help the publishers, but only in cases of very specific books."," And if you have a book with very well-researched and well-edited language, that can make a huge difference. Publisher B They say reviews make a difference in the number of sales because it's people who have reviewed the book beforehand, who have already bought it, who tell their friends and family, who share your book on social media. So the more reviews you get, the better. Publisher C People will give you more reviews, which we don't want to ignore, but if it's your first time, you probably don't need as much information as we would have with other books. Publisher D The review system is important, but it's not the most important part of a book. Publisher D"

C1," And we knew that this was the industry's main problem, its main addiction."" I started smoking a lot of cigarettes when I was 10. It wasn't until about 20 years later that I realized what I did wrong.""",""" ... The government had promised that it wouldn't be advertising on TV. We were told it would be prohibited unless it is really good for children. ""","""

Ads on TV targeted children, in newspapers and on billboards to the tune of a billion dollars a year.

Ads with the slogan ""Makes Kids Smoking"" are still in effect in many of them.

Why did the government so heavily subsidize a tobacco industry?

The tobacco industry is now a multi-billion dollar global giant with major operations in over 40 countries. It has dominated the cigarette market for a century. A recent study of cigarette manufacturers found that their profits have more than doubled over the last quarter century.

What was the tobacco industry trying to do?

It wanted teenagers to choose brands that are advertised for the public. This was a way to make them more willing to smoke. 

The tobacco industry also wanted their products to be available where their consumers were: at schools, at work, at home and where there were places where people were likely to be exposed for many years of their lives. The government paid in part to make this happen.

The tobacco industry has been doing this for the last century, but it became more serious after the Great Depression of the 1930s and the onset of World War II. The tobacco industry, then a very small one, wanted to get the younger generation interested in its products, in the way they were advertised, so that they would be willing to buy them, even though they knew that they would cause cancer and heart disease.","""
The young boy was clearly annoyed when he thought he had been misunderstood. He argued that the government had not only made fun of him, but was also insulting. He explained that they had taken his words out of context, but he did not want to admit they were right, and he said he knew exactly what the industry's ads said. He had witnessed the industry, he said. He said he was sorry he had done wrong.",""" 

He said he was very worried for our future and wondered why we did not advertise to the teenagers. The narrator was a marketing expert.",""" He was more than angry with his former clients when they questioned their findings. ""The study looked at only one brand. We had worked with thousands of boys in the last couple of years. Most of them had never smoked a cigarette, and no one smoked more than a few times. It was their last cigarette, and most would quit. We knew that they would quit and their smoking was so low that we knew it was hard to measure the effects of smoking. His colleagues laughed when he told them about the boy's smoking. He smoked and was one of the worst smokers they knew. He was on a team responsible for studying the smoking habits of thousands of teens."," And we knew why they liked these brands. Those were the kinds of cigarettes to which their mother, and their sisters and friends smoked. These are the kinds of cigarettes they would like to purchase,"" he said."

I was told to wait in the dark room. It was very dark in there. The girl was sitting on the floor in front of Mr. Jaggers. I heard a woman screaming in fright and then I saw the girl fall down. I ran out the back way and saw Mrs. Jaggers and I ran back to the office to tell the story. The story was told to Mr. Jaggers in court and he sentenced the girl to death. The narrator was a child who witnessed the murder of the girl."," There I was taken to another room, where I sat on a chair. He asked me what I was looking for. I asked him if I could give him a look at the keys to the car. He turned around and asked what the hell that was for. I told him that I needed to go to the car for the keys and that I would be back in ten minutes. He said okay but I thought that was too long. Mr Jaggers told me to leave my keys here and he would let me in the car. He handed me a key and asked me to take the key to the car while he called the police. I told him no sir I thought it would be too long to wait in a room alone. After waiting for ten minutes Mr. Jaggers let me in the car and sent me away. At the police station I told the police that I had been abused and then they said they would take me to a hospital and that they wanted me to know what I was looking for.

Lake Bulu lies at a height of 2000 metres above sea level and is one of Kenya's most important tourist spots. The lake has two side shores with a total of 7,000 acres of bountiful green land to explore. Rarely do tourists visit and for some reason this is considered a rare find. It is a quiet lake and few have seen it before. This is the location of Lake Bulu . Richard Nerurkar visited Kenyans' high altitude training camp", He pauses at the summit to look down to the mist that collects at the base of the mountain and the surrounding countryside. This morning is the end of the Kenyan leg of Richard Nerurkar's race towards the Worlds," The last known eruption of Mount Kenya took place in the 14th century. As he steps into the sands of the valley below the highest peak in Africa, Richard Nerurkar looks towards the horizon, thinking about his mission. I am going to run at one of the highest points in the world. I am going to try to break the 10.000-meter world record. To prove that I can, I will climb the Mount Kenya in my underwear. Richard Nerurkar wants to run at 1,800 metres above sea level on Mount Kenya in his underwear to test his credentials"," The runner goes to sleep on a mattress beside the tree in order to conserve their energy when hiking up the mountain. At the top of the mountain, a couple of hundred meters from the summit, a large tent lies beneath a bright light. A man in a blue suit stands up out of the tent. The stranger is a small, slim man of about 30 years. He goes to Richard's tent and opens it. Richard's mother is out of the house. The stranger asks Richard's mother if she can be with the stranger until she gets out of the house. Richard's mother nods. Richard's mother tells the stranger that she was in the house when the stranger arrived. Richard's mother then leaves the tent, the stranger takes a handkerchief from his pocket and ties it round his head. He puts on the blue suit. He then takes out a pair of heavy boots and a bag. Richard finds out that this man is a medical inspector named Albert Wray who is in Nairobi to inspect the mountain's health. The stranger takes his bag of belongings from Richard's tent and leaves. Albert Wray leaves the tent and enters the field of snow, in front of his tent. He walks on the bare ground with his boots on. His boots hit the snow with a loud thump. He picks up something heavy. He picks up a small object. The object is dark in colour. Albert Wray opens the thing up and a blue liquid pours out of it. Albert Wray picks up the blue liquid and drops it into the bag. Albert Wray leaves."," After a couple of hours the trail splits off to a side path towards the base of Mount Kenya. An Indian climber with long arms leads the way on a rocky ridge with a deep snow patch to the right. On this side of the snow a trail leads straight up. The trail comes to a fork and one of the options is to take a shorter but steep climb up the right ridge. On the other side of the snow the trail takes a longer but more comfortable rise to the summit. At this point the trail splits into two. The runner asks how the other climbers reach the summit and the Indian climber points his arms out to the sky and smiles. ""Thanks, it takes a lot of time and effort"", he says"

The boat is the result of an original concept, and the current model is a design produced by another designer. Tom Cunliffe is working on the new design that can go on production in 2021 . The family wants to start designing the interiors within the first year of the next design order. A lot of work is needed to develop the boats interiors, and they will need to build the hull. They hope to expand their team in the next few years. In the meantime, their business partner is building a second yacht.

C1," In addition to using steel to make things they also had the technology to forge the iron in the shape of a sword. In addition to being iron, blacksmiths had knowledge of making stone weapons from stone. It wasn't until the Industrial Revolution that iron was brought into use as an economic resource. They had been using it all the time for building houses tools and utensils. Iron has always been a symbol of power for man and is still seen as a symbol of power in many cultures around the world. Iron and its role in man is not going to disappear."," Their skills were valued by nobility, princes and kings and some of them have been revered as warrior kings or kings of kings. Iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination"," Today this traditional view of the profession has been largely swept away - it is now recognised as an art. But there remains a lingering tradition of male blacksmiths working on horses. In most cultures the men who make their own weapons and armour would usually be in the upper class, or the land owner. The fact that many blacksmiths have traditionally been tied to the land also means that they were often seen as a more humble profession.", The modern blacksmith was once regarded as a dangerous man to be haunted by the evil eye. During the Industrial Revolution and afterward the image of the Blacksmith has been radically altered. Before then blacksmiths were often seen as dangerous and menacing. Now they are often pictured as dangerous and benevolent.," The main difference is that smiths made weapons for military and religious use rather than personal adornment. This type of weapon had very little or no defensive function and was used in the fields to protect crops and livestock. The weapon was an improvised weapon that could only be made from an iron rod or bar. Iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination since ancient times, so many things can be built from the same material.

C1," But there's another side to him that the public probably hasn't known. The Great Explorers mission, in its centenary year this year, is looking to recapture the spirit of the expedition - and its man - by releasing a film on the journey. It's called Halley's Comet. The documentary, which stars Sir Isaac Newton, Tom Cruise, Mark Ruffalo and others, has been commissioned by the British Geological Survey. On board its flagship probe, the Dawn orbiting probe, the Dawn spacecraft, an instrument called the Halley's Comet has been used to measure the Earth's magnetic field, which reveals how the Earth rotates. The probe has also been used to discover the comet's orbit, and reveal some of its secrets. It's known as the 'Big Red Comet' - a big red comet is found by Sir Isaac Newton. In search of true north - the man behind Halley's comet is Dr Toby Clark, a researcher from the British Geological Survey"," He set out from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in 1684 with a party of 6 to chart the movements of the sun, moon and stars. Halley's comet was known as Halley's comet in his honor because it was named after him. He also set out to explore North and South Poles and he had the first observations of a tilt of the Earth from the North Pole. His observations and cartography led to him being awarded the Royal Society's first patent for a compass. He set out from Greenwich in 1684 and ended up tracking the Earth's rotation. His career ended when he was charged with a serious debt of 200. A few of the world's largest discoveries were made from his observations but the discovery of Halley's comet was his greatest achievement. He spent many years travelling all over the world and had many collaborators who helped him make his discoveries. Sir Edmund Halley also set out from Greenwich in 1684 to chart the movements of the sun, moon and stars, and to explore North and South Poles, and he had the first observations of a tilt of the Earth from the North Pole. He then went on to track the Earth's rotation and made a number of discoveries in geography."," But it is the discovering of a new comet that is also credited to him that will be commemorated later this month. On Thursday 22 February the comet made its first appearance in space, where it will remain until August. Anjana Ahuja is a reporter for BBC News."," But he was also involved in a fascinating and possibly crucial project: tracking the changes in Earth's magnetic fields.

Sir William Hutton, a celebrated 19th-century physicist and astronomer, and his team carried out a global survey of magnetic fields in the 19th century. This led to the establishment of the International Year of Magnetic Fields (IYMF), which has been celebrated every year since 1924.

The International Year of Magnetic Fields was set up by Sir William Hutton. He was part of an international team of scientists who measured magnetic fields worldwide in the 19th Century. It is celebrated every year since 1924. (Image: International Year of Magnetic Fields, 2012)

""They used a special magnet to trace magnetic lines on the ground. The magnet moved at high speeds on a track where the field was monitored at several points. Each magnet was equipped with a computer.""

""By plotting the location of the magnets across the world, they determined the shape of the Earth's magnetic field, or vector map, over a number of years. This information was used to map the Earth's magnetic fields every year,"" wrote John Whipple in the 2005 edition of The History of Science.

""If a point is a position on a map, the magnetic field strength there represents the strength of the magnetic north pole.""

This led to the establishment of the International Year of Magnetic Fields (IYMF)

It turns out, however, that the magnetic north pole was slightly displaced over time.

For example, the north magnetic field was seen slightly to the north in 1551, then shifted towards the south and to the south again in 1561 and in 1620. Over three centuries, the magnetic north pole was displaced on average 8 degrees north.

Now scientists have tried to explain this curious shift. One hypothesis is that the north magnetic field was shifted due to changes in Earth's orbit. But the scientists also suggested that global warming could be responsible for the phenomenon. In particular, they suggested that global warming caused the magnetic field to move more quickly than the Earth was moving.

In this case, the global warming may have been responsible for the displacement of the magnetic north pole.

How the survey of Sir William Hutton's team came to be known as the International Year of Magnetic Fields was the idea of a colleague..."," However his quest to record the variation in the direction that the sun makes with time began when he was looking for the true north. Halley set off from the English town of Bembury in 1675 on a quest to see where his lost lost ship had gone. It is thought that some of his comets, including Halley's comet, were lost in the Atlantic in search of the north. The quest to find the north led to an array of events in the year 1675-1696 which, if the facts were put together today, would form part of an epic story. Scroll down for video . The quest to find the north led to an array of events in the year 1675-1696 which, if the facts were put together today, would form part of an epic story . It took more than 20 years for the quest to find the north to end when the captain of Halley's ship, the Flying Fish, found the North Magnetic Pole, the northernmost point in the earth. He had made what is known as his 'grand discovery' - a landmark that could not be repeated. It was only on the first day of 1695 that the name of the North Pole officially became established. When the north pole was discovered, Halley set off on a voyage to retrace his footsteps. In 1695 he set off on his 'grand discovery' as his ship, the Flying Fish, sailed west from Bembury. Halley's comet had arrived near the Cape of Good Hope. On the first day of 1695 when the Flying Fish left Bembury to search for the North Magnetic Pole, an old friend of Halley joined them on their journey. He was named Toby Clark and he became the man whose quest will help to understand the movement of the sun. Clark made a total of three voyages - with Clark in 1694 - 1695 - 1698. During the voyage Clark would have recorded observations as the ship traveled. He made a total of six voyages - with Clark in 1694 - 1695 -..."," But while the comet brought him fame, a more obscure discovery also laid claim to his name: His attempt to chart and measure the Earth's magnetic north. In the year 1696 he used a telescope to find, using a star called the Halley Star, that the magnetic North was in fact moving north as he moved across the sky. This discovery convinced him that the magnetic north is a real thing, and perhaps the strongest of all the ideas he'd heard from astronomers for some time. While Halley used a star to find the magnetic north, the discovery did not end there. As the comet passed over his northern hemisphere, it passed over the northernmost points on the Moon and the sun. The comet would then leave a trail behind, called the Halley comet's tail. Sir Edmund Halley's journey began in 1696 when he discovered a new comet. In 1696 he used a telescope to find, using a star called the Halley Star, that the magnetic North was in fact moving north as he moved across the sky. This discovery convinced him that the magnetic north is a real thing, and perhaps the strongest of all the ideas he'd heard from astronomers for some time. After his famous comet was discovered, Halley returned to England. Back in 1696, he took up a new job as director of the Natural History Academy, now the British Geological Survey. In England, Halley had a more difficult task: To convince King James II of the magnetic north's existence. It was necessary for him to establish that the magnetic north would change by thousands of miles every year, and to prove to the king that it was an accurate map. He also wanted to show that the north star, used to identify the northernmost point on the Moon and the sun, could be used to find the magnetic north, just as the moon is used to find the Earth's equatorial plane. To achieve this, Halley planned an experiment to test his theory. He would be traveling to America to study the magnetic north. First, he expected the yearly movement of the magnetic north to happen, because when a comet passed over the northernmost point on the Moon, it would leave behind the..."," His journey with the Halley comet made him a prime subject of study for astrophysiologists but in this case, his quest led him to investigate the Earth's magnetic fields. A quest for a better understanding of the Earth's magnetic fields led to some new theories for the Earth's formation as a result of the comet strike. Tune in to the BBC Radio 4 programme This Morning on Friday 14 September at 1pm to find out more.  A true north is found by taking measurements along the Earth's magnetic fields.

My guide advised me to keep moving, climb in a different place. I kept going because I still had hope that a rock would pop up. But the rock stayed under the glacier. And the glacier grew. I kept on climbing and I climbed for three days into an empty glacier. Finally, a glacier was empty of rock, and a snowfall of four inches took the rock out of the glacier. Then I knew I had achieved my goal. I climbed all seven Summits, as well as Mount Everest, Mount Transect, and Mount Elbert. I reached the base of all seven, and I had also conquered Mount Everest. A. Mount McKinley: I tried climbing the mountain at age 16. The weather was pretty bad, and we had to hike to base camp and stay the night. I was excited about climbing the mountain, as I had never been to the United States. But the first thing I saw on the mountain was a small mountain, which I had already climbed. I walked back to the mountain to see the snow pack on the mountain. It looked pretty good. But I was a bit disappointed because it was much lower than I had seen on the mountain. Then I saw a large mountain that I had climbed before. When I looked closer at the small mountain, I realized it was nothing more than a rock, which was not moving with the rest of the mountain. At the end of the day, I had climbed the rock, not the mountain. A. Mount Vinson E. Mount McKinley: I set..."," Everest Mount Everest is the highest peak on Earth and the second highest peak in the world.

Photographer: Jenny Photography by Jenny.com A photo is more compelling when taken with someone in it. A photo without a human interest isn't compelling at all."," These make up almost half of the work photographers do. People are often seen as boring or boring, although some have a lot to say. They are also the hardest subjects to photograph in a good way. But once you get some experience you will be able to create amazing photos about people."," The photographer is usually at the mercy of the subject and his mood. Photographing People: The Importance of the Subject Photographs of people, however, are sometimes hard to find. The following are pictures that have been taken of People and not of some other subjects:"," People Photography is a subject of much debate. Photographing people is the subject of many discussions.

C1," Also not that Christopher realizes it, but the guests are paying in cash at this unimaginable rate. At the exact same moment, the real guest enters through the window and steals a bundle of cash from Christopher's pocket, leaving the hotel in the dead of the night. Sounds like a perfect murder and the perfect murderer. No, no, the killer is someone else…A man in a black hat. An old man with a black hat, in a black hat. An old man in a black hat. And he's stealing cash from Christopher Middleton, the inspector."," The hostess at the desk, who also recites rates over the phone, is still unaware of the identity of the real customer. The bartender, who has the actual check made, is still unaware of the real guest. No one is wearing glasses. The owner of the hotel, a crook and a lousy cook, is still unaware of the actual guest. The owner of the hotel is a lousy cook, and not even a real cook, but more like a cook with a fancy degree who has been tucked into the industry for an underwhelming career. The director of the hotel is more of a flunky, a flaky performer who has no business in a hotel inspection. This is the hotel. They know this. So why are things going so wrong?"," No one is calling, the lobby is deserted and nobody shows up, so the inspector goes into the hallway to assess the condition of the walls. She notices a wallpaper on a chair that is a strange shade of blue. Not only that, it feels unusually dry and lifeless. The inspector is not going to be bullied. She examines the room, walks up the hallway to see if she is heard and finds a room which is completely empty. The inspector looks at her cell phone, sees she has one, as it always is, but she has yet to answer. She's got fifteen minutes to get the property on the market! The inspector finds the hotel and offers the guest a free suite until the situation can be fixed. The guest agrees to stay in the suite until things are back on track. While the inspector makes sure the property can be sold, a guest walks through the hallway, looking for someone to hire."," The hotel concierge is still doing a business as usual; no one from the hotel staff is aware of the guests arriving and leaving. The room service manager is still talking down to a lady on his lunch break, saying something to the effect of “You’re going to have to keep that smile on your face”. The manager of the housekeeping is still trying to get the bar maid to stop leaving the pool area unattended. Then Sue comes along. She is the hotel’s most experienced inspector and is always on time. No surprise, no problem. The rooms are cleaned and the beds are made. The only thing missing is the coffee. Sue notices the bar set-up isn’t exactly what she expected but she keeps going. She smiles at Chris as he walks up to her. He points out the issue with the coffee is on the next room and Sue puts it right. She then goes on with her inspection. The other inspector, Mr. Jones, is also impressed with Sue but he insists on coming to the Globe Hotel the second week of inspection. He tells the hotel owner to hire more employees. That night the Globe Hotel, for lack of a better term, crashes. The owner of the Globe Hotel, a former hotel owner himself, is not too sure what to do. He calls Sue and tells her that they are not hiring her. He tells her they need someone who knows how to put up a hotel room and have great customer service skills. The owner suggests hiring a housekeeper with 10 years of experience. This suggestion, coupled with the barman’s question on the next day, leads Chris into a corner. This is a tale for the ages..."," After a few moments of awkwardness the real guest shows up. A tall, dark haired man named Christopher Middleton. Upon seeing the real guest he begins to run, but his footsteps soon echo in the hotel corridors. This leads to a series of chase scenes that quickly turn into a confrontation between the two men who are clearly not friends.

C1," While the application process and the interview were not going well at the moment we went abroad, writing a good sample of handwriting might have been worth more than the job. I suppose it is not surprising that this is being studied, especially in the medical field. Many diseases spread through the bloodstream, and their most dangerous weapon is the virus that causes the hepatitis C. The virus is detectable in a person’s blood by testing the blood with a simple blood test. If there is hepatitis C, it can be spread through blood transfusions. One in every 100 people infected with hepatitis C die. But a person infected with hepatitis C can be cured with a treatment called interferon therapy. The doctor prescribed me a course of this medication and I got over the hepatitis C within four months. When I stopped taking the interferon therapy and the antiviral drug two weeks ago, my blood test showed the virus again and I am now in the midst of my sixth year of fighting it. If you were infected with hepatitis C, you would probably get cured with interferon therapy and antiviral drugs. The sample of your handwriting might be another clue to the character of a person. A handwritten sample of your handwriting could possibly yield a clue to your character and help you make a good decision. However, it is not always possible to analyse your handwriting at the moment. One option is to send the sample to someone else, such as a psychologist, but this is a costly option. My handwriting is not that good. But it was good enough for me to win the job. It was also good enough for me to win the job."," The pen is mightier than the psychologist, the pencil is mightier than the analyst, and the rubber stamp is mightier than the professor. The writer is trying to convey the power of writing in our lives."," We live in an age in which technology is used every second of every day. Technology has revolutionised every aspect of life. Technology has transformed human communication. Technology has revolutionised the way we access information. Technology has enabled people to exchange information faster and more easily. Technology has enabled people to communicate with someone even thousands of miles away at the click of a button. But technology has also left its mark on our personalities. In our society today, our culture is built on the foundations of technology. Technology is the major driver of our world. Most of our decisions and actions are dictated by technology. We get our daily necessities from our technology. And this is not good because of what we see here and now. In the process of doing this, we start to forget the truth. Technology has robbed our lives of some of its most precious values. Some of its greatest treasures we have lost in a long time. Technology has stripped our life of its beauty. Technology has been transforming our world, and at the same time it has made us forgetful and lost. The question is, what is good for us if we can achieve everything in life at the touch of a button? To understand this, we must first look at the importance of handwriting. When we talk about handwriting, we usually think of an adult writing a letter to communicate something important to someone. But there is a connection between handwriting and how we develop our communication skills and how we learn to communicate our ideas. Handwriting has a unique place in human communication because it is the tool that is used in teaching us how to communicate. Hands are used to teach us to control speech and gestures. It is also the medium of expression that shapes our way of speaking. In other words, our handwriting shows..."," Handwriting is seen as the most important skill, even in countries which do not have a written language. Handwriting might be used to communicate information to people in other countries. Handwriting is also the basis of other language learning. The way that you write is one indicator of your intelligence and culture. Handwriting can also be used for research."," In fact, handwriting analysis may tell us so much about a person's character. The pen and paper would be unthinkable to the mind of a psychoanalyst. In contrast, handwriting is an excellent sign of the individual's personality. A small amount of ink, applied in the proper strokes, can convey an enormous amount of information about a person's emotions and feelings. In addition, handwriting can reveal very deep meanings and even secrets. The way someone writes can tell a lot about the state of mind at the time. In fact, in some countries, it could even be the only thing the employer had in hand for your candidacy for the job. Writing the perfect handwriting is not something that happens overnight, and there are some habits that a writer should develop to get them to write in the correct way. Most experts agree that to develop the best handwriting, the writer should start with the simplest elements of the pen. Write out a word of three letters in the middle of the page. Practice applying the tip of the pen smoothly and correctly to it. Then, use a line to draw a small circle on one side of the letter. This makes an arrow. The arrow should point straight at the circle you just drew. This is the ideal initial pen stroke. Once the basic shapes of the initial pen stroke have been mastered, it is time to develop more complicated patterns. Write out a word of more than three letters. Then, create an even larger circle from the smaller one you just created. Make a second circle around this larger circle. These larger circles should..."," In this excerpt from A Letter to My Boyfriend from Jane Austen, the author uses total syllables to evaluate a sentence.

C1," My boss took a quick interest in the accident and apologised for being so hard on a debutante. Of course, if the plate had broken the next time, my boss would've blamed me for the accident. I was lucky to get my first job, as the restaurant was a much better place than the one where I worked, but my boss was a jerk. When I was a waitress, I'd be quick on the draw to help the poor people who need a hand. I'd even volunteer to carry their groceries, or deliver their children to school, but the truth is that it was the poor people who could benefit from the services I rendered. Being a good wife and a good mother didn't take the place of the service that I'd rendered others. It was like I was taking a bribe to do something without having to do it. It's not the kind of thing you need to do, but you just have to do it because everyone is so nice to you that you have to. If the only reason I did this was to get some free stuff, I'd have told my boss that that wasn't the way to do it. If the only reason I did it was to have better work conditions, I'd have complained. The only thing that wasn't nice about being a good wife and a good mother was that I had to do it. After my boss asked if I'd done it, I started apologising for what I did, which was doing the work I'd been assigned so the pay check wasn't due in a month. She was very sweet about it, even though she knew it was the wrong thing to do. And she didn't even let me finish my sentence before slapping me and telling me I had to start doing it again. And I'd do it again, despite knowing what I'd done and knowing what I would get back in a month's time. So why do we need these social service centers? Why are people so nice to us? Well, because we need to keep up appearances."," And when I got stuck in a hairy corner it was all about the 'Oh no, I forgot...' My boss was always there and his quick wit and sharp mind soon made me the one laughing at his jokes. In fact when my job was done he kept me laughing with him. And he was always a good friend who would cheer me up when I was in despair. After a few months I started being a bit too friendly, too many customers, and too good, too polite. I was getting the wrong message, as I was soon reminded. But I knew better than to question him. One fine day someone came in without a smile, and there was a silence. My boss walked to her and said, 'Hey, you don't even have your hat on?' I had no idea what to say. She apologized and said, 'Don't worry my hat was just left by my friend, the waitress.' She looked at me, and took off the hat she had been wearing on her head. 'My hat is off' she said firmly. My boss quickly took the hat off, too, as he was waiting for her to put on her own. And they left the place together. The next morning I was asked by the boss how it happened that he had got in an accident and my boss stopped him from hitting his head with the car. The next question he asked was whether the other man had any idea what was going on and then she could tell that it was the best thing he could have done. 'Oh,' said he 'when he had his hat on, my boss could just be seen.'"," 'Not again' I warned my mother. 'Why did you have to drop the plate' she asked, 'it is broken'. 'Not again' again I told her. The next time I was asked what I wanted, my friend asked the server instead and the second time I was asked what I wanted, my mother asked a waitress instead. I grew up thinking it was OK to be nice to those you trusted and be nice to everybody but my friends. The waitress I was asked for a request had just walked out from a class and was so tired she looked miserable. I'm not sure if she was asked to do the request for a favor or for free because the girl looked miserable but I was asked to bring her a small treat. I handed the order over to her and then I was told to tell the girl who said she didn't have anything I wanted. I looked at my friends and their mothers and realised I had to tell the girl. I had spent the whole day on my back, and it had gotten so I wasn't in the best of moods. 'Hi' I said. The waitress nodded and said 'Hi'. She smiled at me and handed me the treat. 'Please, sit down. What is this for' she asked. A man behind the counter handed me a plate to put the treat on, and handed me the plate for her. She sat down and picked up the treat on the plate. The man came back with an empty plate, asked me to put the plate back, but to only put the dish on. The waitress said I could bring the dish to her but I said no, 'Thanks but I had to put the plate back'. I handed her the plate and she picked up the dish on the plate. 'Thanks again' she said 'Don't thank me'. I handed it to her, and asked 'What would your treat be'. 'I don't have any' she said. 'I thought it was supposed to be a small treat' I said. The man behind the counter told me how she was so tired that she was hardly able to eat. 'What can I do' I asked. He asked my friend about it and the friend told me to drop the plate and be a good girl. 'I didn't do a thing, I was too nice' I said."," 'You're too kind,' everyone complained. I thought I'd been lucky because nothing was broken, but my colleagues were right. My smile made a mess of the restaurant. They would say 'too nice' for no reason. Now I just smile and the glass looks right, like a pro. The waitress."," 'Seriously' cried the waitress at the front when I spilled the sauce on the floor and the dish spat on her table. 'I'm sorry' repeated the server when I accidentally put the wrong wine in the glass. 'Don't worry' I replied in a reassuring voice. A little later that waitress apologized again. 'Hey there, I'll have you know' I said with a smile. 'That was really awful, don't apologize again' she said as I left without apologizing. I didn't really know what to do with it when I was done but I just wanted to smile and everything would be okay. All the staff loved me but when I started looking for jobs I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do. Luckily I had the help of an old lady from the church. 'If you are too nice you attract evil' she said. 'Not really' I said with a smile. 'Too nice attracts anyone who's too nice.' She looked at me and then down at the floor. I looked to the side and giggled. I was so embarrassed. The good news was that she only said that as a joke."," I was wrong. The scale doesn't matter to me. I loved it. I was proud to have a novel in the English language. In grade ten, however, a voice whispered in my ear, 'Don't worry, your Flesch-Kincaid Grade level is above average. But it is too high, it should be a bit lower.' The words were spoken quite harshly. 'When in doubt, write what you say out loud, or you will be laughed at.' I stared in blank silence. As I pondered, the teacher walked by with the textbook in her hand. 'Grade 10 English' she said. She smiled, and held out a notepad. 'Here you are,' she said, 'Write the words aloud.' I looked around for her eyes, and then stared at her again. She smiled, she looked out the window, and then she went back to her desk. There, she sat down at the desk, and said, 'Now write the words aloud.' I started."," I couldn't bear the thought of the customers getting left out so I pretended to be quite apologetic but in reality I was very upset. Once it was over, I ran to the kitchen and grabbed the plate from the floor just in time to save another set of dishes. The owner of the restaurant immediately left a promotion for you."

In a world where science is on the wane, and in a world where the people who drive are in control of the airplanes instead of the pilots, the question of why airplanes should fly the way they do seems to be just as strange and irrelevant as the first question in the question of why the earth is round. It could be that scientists don't have an answer, but a better answer than that, because they know that they have to. Tom Mumford: Science flying in the face of gravity This was not an unusual plane at all. It was, in fact, a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker. On this occasion, the plane's first official test flight took place on a grassland strip between the towns of Brampton and Portland in eastern North Dakota. The KC-135 is a long-range strategic bomber and tanker. Originally named the Boeing C-130, it was redesigned to a C-135 on December 26, 1964. In March 1972, the first KC-135 entered service in the United States, with the US Air Force continuing to use the Boeing Boeing C-17 Globemaster III and the United States Air Force using the Boeing C-130J. Tom Mumford was on board the first KC-135 test flight. The KC-135 takes its name from its ability to fly in an anti-gravity mode. Its engines are supplied with water to assist in drag reduction and lift, making it able to fly at altitudes of up to 30,000 feet. Tom Mumford's colleagues are standing on the grassland strip beside Tom Mumford's plane in North Dakota. Tom Mumford explains how weightlessness works. The KC-135 is a long-range strategic bomber and tanker. It is equipped with a..."," But Tom Mumford knows something more than just the name of the aircraft. He is not just some college student from Boston who will tell you his theories about flying. His theory is that the new Boeing has been developed to make humans feel as if they are flying in the face of gravity. It's a theory Tom mumford has been studying for a year. His research, published in the Journal of Physics, is proof that the Boeing has succeeded. He says the new aircraft is built to make people feel more like astronauts, rather than air travelers in ordinary commercial airplanes. It was built, in Tom's words, to make the flight experience more like what happens in space. So what is the big deal about weightlessness? The answer, says Tom, is that it's like living on a spaceship for two weeks. It's something people can't understand. That's the big secret. One in 10 Americans doesn't have enough of enough of an exercise routine to keep in shape. Most of us are too lazy to get to the gym. And that is something the new Boeing can prove to you. A new model of Boeing's aircraft has been developed with the goal of making people feel the thrill of flying. Tom's research shows that the Boeing has succeeded. All the aircraft are designed in a special way to make people feel as if they're flying. This new Boeing can do that, too, he says, by adding an extra layer to the aircraft's structure. The idea is to make the cabin feel a little bit less like a spaceship and more like an aircraft that's in the air. This extra layer of insulation, he says, increases the sense of weightlessness as well as pressure. That means that people who fly the Boeing will feel very little of the sensation of weightlessness, and instead the feeling is almost like weightlessness itself, says Tom. When the cabin is pressurized, the effect on weightlessness increases, as is...", But for this group of kids it was something completely new. They were the first US students ever to spend more than six hours in an aircraft in free-fall.," The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale considers the total words, total sentences, and total syllables in a text, in this example from a science journal. Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964 a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. After the initial excitement and rushing around, the students began to wonder who was the real pilot and what were they really testing. They were testing the truth of the new theories: Would weightlessness have any effect on life, on airplanes, and on spacecraft? They wondered if their weightlessness experiment would take them astray from the real story of Tom Mumford, the young journalist, and his airplane. The young pilot continued to show his passengers that the airplane was built in 1964, and not for this trip. This example was taken from the text. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale considers the total words, total sentences, and total syllables in a text"," The Boeing refuelling tanker was never actually flying over a mountain. It was only seen flying around the base during the demonstration. The Boeing tanker could carry 200 tons of fuel and fly at 8,000 miles per hour. The Boeing tanker was designed by Boeing to make it a cost-effective option for the airlines. It is the only type of refuelling tanker that uses liquid fuel. For this demonstration, the Boeing tanker was flying at 8,000 miles per hour. The Boeing tanker was designed to be used by airlines. Boeing refuelling tanker weighed in at around 800 tons. Boeing tanker flew over a mountain during demonstration . At the front of the Boeing tanker, the pilot got his seat in the Boeing tanker.

C1," I knew nothing about the history and legacy of the artist and my memories are rather hazy. But I think my favourite moment of the trip was when he walked up to me on the deck of a boat, his black suit and flowing dark hair caught in the breeze. 'Excuse me, I am Mr Picasso,' he said, still holding the bag on his left arm."," We were travelling together with a group of French students who had a big backpack but very little in common and my fellow travelers were never seen again. We spent a week together - from June to August in 1967 - living and learning in French schools in Brussels, Calais, Barcelona, Paris, Montfort-l'Amaury, and Cannes. In one of my notes, I wrote that, as with all old people, Picasso had a strong sense of humour. After his retirement he became a famous comedian of French culture. His humour was often so simple and so close to the heart that it left one with a chuckle. The French are such funny people: in Cannes, I had a conversation with an older man whom I had seen a few years before at the same university, the University of Paris. He had just turned 59 and I asked him where he was from. He had a small, light moustache and he said: ""Pablo Picasso."" I remember him now but not in the way a memory can. His simple but sincere friendliness, his simple, simple humor, which was in line with the great painter, was more precious than the many memorable stories he told. One of my French teacher's most special gifts for me, when I first came to France, was the book he had found, a collection of poems written by the painter. It was also his favorite book - the other books were full of political and social views that he despised. Picasso was not only a very good poet but an excellent writer and journalist - I believe that he was more French than all the French I knew. In spite of his great talent, he also had a strong sense of humour, and when he died in 2008, in Paris, he left one of the great artists of the world, a real life person and a real soul. As a young student, when I was about to graduate, I was introduced to the art world with the painter Diego Rivera, another of his famous friends: the Mexican artist and writer was one of the most..."," One such day in Cannes was when Picasso was showing a new work of his at the Galerie des Glaciers. He was sitting in a large chair in front of a huge screen showing a view of the sea. A young student sat opposite and could not bear to see him eat, yet his mind could not resist watching his master work. Picasso took to drinking, then a second student noticed his looks and offered to help him. When Picasso saw the offer of money, he snapped at the student and asked 'who would you rather drink or be taught to paint?' The student looked at Picasso a moment and then offered to buy the painting. Picasso took his money and looked at the young man's handwriting. As he took his seat, he told him 'this is not a good handwriting.' When he finished his meal he turned over the painting to the student - and said, 'never mind, I'll teach you how to paint it later on.'"," In my eyes I was always a lout but Richard Cork was the only person who could identify with me. His humour brought me to a sense of calm. He was a wise man who loved life. When I was his age, it was easy for me to see the world from his perspective. I think it was my desire to explore the world through his eyes that drew me to him. His smile always made me smile. His laughter had me giggling. His eyes kept me watching. His eyes would follow me and his laughter would keep me going. I wanted to catch his eye and laugh with him but it was difficult, in these rough times. I knew only too well the loneliness of being a university student. I felt very much alone in this rough world. But it was the simple things that brought him joy. His laughter and smile were like sunshine in a dark room. He gave me joy and confidence. Richard Cork."," I had never before been introduced to a famous artist like Picasso and had only recently made my acquaintance with him.
The following afternoon my car had been broken into by the two assailants. What happened to my van? I didn't know, it had left the door ajar and was still in the garden of an office block."," The van was small with barely enough room for our clothes and our belongings, with nothing bigger than a bunk for the driver to sit on. I could only imagine the size of the artist and his life. I also wondered if he was ever visited by anyone. Richard Cork"," Richard Cork recalls. The day we were in Cannes, I was in awe. I was one of these student who travel the country doing research at universities. I used to travel a lot when I was in Cambridge. It was a bit like being a tourist. Most of the times I would be driving and I would travel round the country. Now I was studying in France and I travelled the same route I would in Cambridge. But while you might be familiar with what happened in Cannes I might not even know where the castle is. It was a bit like driving round a golf course. I was doing the same thing but driving around Europe, visiting universities and looking at paintings and monuments and things like this. But I also went to university in England for two years. I was studying a degree in translation and got an M.A., the lowest A-level grade I can give myself is 4 so I would not be able to graduate. I went to Cambridge for four years at Cambridge A-level. I was on the A* and A levels from my first year at Cambridge to my final year. They are easier than the A-levels at Cambridge. But the A* and A-levels at Cambridge were different. You got a better grade and you also got to do things like get jobs. I got a job at the beginning of my second year at Cambridge. Then the next year I went to London to study translation. I got a job there. The reason I had to go to London was because I needed a job, not because I would get a better grade and be in better company there. I went to London just to get a job. I got another job, then another, until I got a job at an..."
C1," By the end of 1994 there were only about a million ads on the air. It was then that the recession hit the advertising industry. What should the people buy? By the end of the year, the economy had changed in ways that could not be predicted. There was a huge uptick in consumer spending which had no one in sight but the advertisers. Advertising went bonkers with consumer spending. As consumers started to buy more things and the economy was not going quite as fast as advertisers thought it would, the advertising industry started to suffer. In the early years the advertisers saw the economy slow down, but they did not expect it to be this slow. Many were even anticipating growth in that it had been rising and that there would be a big increase in consumer spending. Those projections were unrealistic. Advertising companies tried to anticipate the worst, but they would not have been able to foresee the speed of consumer behavior that was so surprising. The ad agencies went into overdrive to try to get the industry a strong performance. They worked hard to get consumers to buy more of their products. They had better advertising to do. But they could not match the upheaval that was happening in the consumer mind. Advertisers were forced to adapt to the new consumer. In the early days of the recession, some advertisers began to take out extra effort to reach out to younger people. Many advertisers began to show ads featuring new youthful, fashionable stars in movies. Many advertisers tried to appease their younger consumers. They began to do more appearances on MTV. This has created a situation where it is advertisers themselves that are telling their younger consumers what to buy. Advertising is beginning to be forced to adapt to the new consumer. Consumers are starting to be able to think for themselves. There are a lot..."," And now, everyone is paying attention to it, and it is going to doom the ad industry. It may be that it is as though the world is waking up. In the world, advertising is getting better. But in the country the problems of advertisement are growing worse. We have an epidemic of dissatisfied consumers. Many, many years ago, advertisement was the answer to all of our problems. Then in the 80s, there was an explosion of new media technologies, and as with everything on the new media, the problem grew more complex. It is becoming more difficult to sell to the people and it is becoming more difficult to sell to the digital world."," The problems of advertising are too great to deal with individually by individual marketers. It takes a group effort and a huge effort. It is as if a bunch of football players could not beat a team of badminton players. And that is the case when it comes to marketing. Many companies don't have the resources to make their own ads. Instead, they are turned to mass marketing as a means to generate publicity. Most of the ads made using this mass marketing method are unoriginal and boring. Mass marketing of this nature is only a waste of money."," In the United States, for example, it is now slower than the manufacturing sector and it has begun to lag behind technology. This makes advertising's task even more difficult. As a result of all of these difficulties the US has lost out in the global advertising battle, according to a report. Today advertising in the United States is smaller than ever before in terms of economic size and importance. Advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change and has been slower than the manufacturing sector."," It is now going through the same slow death spiral that consumer goods once traversed. But, you might be asking yourself why the decline in advertising? The truth is that the rise of digital marketing has outpaced all the advertising efforts that most companies have spent in the past. And, the future is not looking too promising for advertising. What is it that is going wrong with advertising? Advertisers, for years, have been concerned about the size and scope of the media universe and the increasing proliferation of electronic devices, such as computers, mobile phones, and tablets, as well as the Internet and other online tools and technology, and its impact on the way we consume media. In the early years of the millennium, a big chunk of advertising was spent on television, mainly on TV commercials. In fact, the Internet was used more as a backlink in TV advertisements than anything else until very recently, which is why advertisers spend so much money on television. Advertisers had a good time in the '80s, '90s, and '00s, but the media world has changed so much that it has left the old adage that the end time for TV adverts in U.S. will be around 2007-2009 as advertisers increasingly spend less money on television."," This isn't just the poor health of advertising itself. It's just that the economy can't keep up with advertising. Advertising has lost its ability to produce the goods and services the people want. Many of the goods and services we want are now bought elsewhere. Our money is being siphoned away in other places. In the meantime, the rich get richer. The poor get poorer. Ads, ads, and more ads. And everyone has to buy. Everyone. The more we advertise, the less we enjoy ourselves. That's the basic fact of mass marketing. It has to do with the economy in general. And it means the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer, as advertised.", However a lot of ads still work. So how advertisers are going to beat these new global challenges with the same old techniques? Answer: Answer not in context
C1," In a remote rural area a remote rural area Georgina McGuiness was working on converting a family home. She had moved from a small town in the south east of England into the home before she left the home.

The main living area which had served as her home for more than ten years was no longer suitable for her as a working journalist, she needed a suitable environment to bring her into contact with modern technology. Georgina McGuiness wanted to use the home as an efficient office but had no idea how to get started. This is the first in a series of articles which will show how she has transformed her home into an efficient workspace. The conversion has not been without problems.

It was a place where everyone hated living, I think. It was also a home where I did nothing for many years. But I wanted to change that. I wanted to make a home that was attractive, inspiring and functional. I wanted it to be interesting and appealing. I felt I could achieve that through furniture, lighting, paint and plants. It should be a place that made me want to spend more time in. I looked into how to incorporate some of the latest technology into my home so I could be productive throughout the day.

""I always thought it was just going to get sold. A family home would be too big for a journalist, but it turned out not to be true,"" she says. In fact, after she contacted Louise Brookes she also received a second, even better offer from a local journalist. But before they could finally agree on the price, Mrs McGuiness's youngest child, Georgina, decided to turn it into an efficient home office. ""Just so she wouldn't have to worry about her lifestyle while she was working I bought the house for her,"" says Geoghanna. ""I thought maybe it would just get sold, but I was wrong."" Geoghanna was so determined to sell her house that she spent $125,000 just to get rid of any potential buyers. She says she spent the last $25,000 on furniture and equipment. ""The old dining room and kitchen are gorgeous, but I got rid of everything, everything that's not necessary and just kept everything modern,"" she says. As she worked on it her daughter became a journalist, and it turned out she would love it as well. After Louise Brookes bought it, the rest of the family and friends helped her find the right furniture.

C1, One summer the park decided to expose them in their trains in what one commentator called THEIR BEST PLAIN. A group of peacocks were put in front of a large screen to show off their incredible feathers. They were dressed the same way each year as well. One particular peahen became infatuated. It is a story told by a park's director.," The mystery was resolved by Charles Darwin, who wrote that birds were 'adaptations' to our climate. However, there is still much to learn about the amazing adaptations of birds."," If you want to know how to put a peacock into the spotlight, just look at the pictures of the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park."," Charles Darwin studied evolution in the park in the 1870s.

How can birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance?," The stories are set at Whipsnade Wildlife Park in Bedfordshire, a beautiful and pristine reserve on the banks of the Thames.

C1," As a result there is no doubt that we are all inherently talented. Human animals are all born with a similar natural talent for certain types of work (perhaps, or perhaps not) that makes them good at it. These are talents that they have inborn: skills (a talent) or abilities (a talent) that make an individual good at something. They are called innate talent. Human animals born this way have innate talent.", The reason why they have such similarities is that our brains are wired to learn the same things. For example we all have similar memory strengths. We all have a tendency to memorise patterns of information and we also all have a learning style in which you can learn the most easily. There’s also a biological advantage to sharing memory. This is because our memory is stronger when it is coupled with another memory from another human. That is not the only advantage we have: human brains are also much more malleable than the brains of other animals. Our minds are constantly under pressure and trying to make sense of our world. And we don’t have the evolutionary advantage of chimpanzees because our minds do not have to deal with the stresses that animals faced when they were first born. But the evolutionary advantage doesn’t mean all our advantages. In our evolutionary battle against other species we also have evolved to communicate through words. Our brains are not completely malleable like our bodies. They can be modified by stress or learning. They are not completely wired to be capable of learning. And they don’t always communicate through words. On the whole the human brain is the smartest organ in the body. Read and write can improve its working. But we also know that the average person has the potential to learn what the book tells him or her in the same way that a chimp on the street can learn from reading about our lives.," The human body is made up of many cells, but there are some that have a characteristic function that only humans have. We humans have developed some abilities that chimps don’t have. A student wrote:  ‘The cells in our human body have a characteristic function that only humans have. We humans have developed some abilities that chimps don’t have.’", But the natural talents humans have evolved together with chimpanzees in the past billion years can actually help us to survive today. When you’re the only survivor in a jungle survival is all that really matters. Be the first to find the next human to survive. Question: How many humans are there On Earth? 7 million," A child is born to each of us with our individual traits and talents. 

We’re born with certain personality, physical and mental traits. Some of these traits help us in performing different jobs and activities that we do in this world. These characteristics are known as natural talents. For example, if we say we are fast and nimble, we are saying we are not too shy and can handle our time well. In fact, if we said we were not afraid of heights we could say we are talented at climbing.

Many people have their own talents. When they are aware of their talents, they try to put them to use. They put effort in finding their talent by doing the activity that they do most effectively. They try to develop it by learning from others, for example, by attending a training program. Then they put aside what they can’t do or aren’t good at. Some people have an inability to recognize their talents. Others may be unaware of their talents or may try to hide their talents from others.

Natural talents are not limited to physical activities. They can be mental and mental activities as well. People who are unable to recognize their natural talents have trouble in their learning process. Because of this, they get into trouble."," The last few centuries have been marked by the development of written languages and speech. These have increased the number of morphemes in the word vocabulary. As a result, words become easier to read, but the difficulty in learning to read is increased. Words become more difficult, the number of morphemes in the word vocabulary is not increased as rapidly as previously, so words become harder to understand. As a consequence of these changes in the meaning of words, sentences are more difficult to read. This increase in the number of morphemes in the word vocabulary in the past few centuries may be the cause of the dramatic increase in the number of sentences. This in turn may be partially responsible for the dramatic increase in the number of sentences. If we consider the effect of the number of morphemes in the word vocabulary on readability, then words are divided into morphemes according to their pronunciation. So, for example, the word tree can be divided into three morphemes: tr, r, and er. This is not the only way a morpheme can be divided. For example, the word horse also can be divided into three morphemes, h, r, and r. The effect of the increase in the number of sentences is that sentences are no longer as easy to read as they used to be. The increase in the number of sentences may be partially responsible for the increase in the number of words. The increasing number of sentences may be partially responsible for the dramatic increase in the number of words."," In the wild chimps are generally solitary and only rarely do they live in groups of large numbers. They can hunt and kill quite well. They also have strong and unique senses which allow them to perceive things hidden in their environment which are hard for us to find using the naked eyes. CLOSE: The common ancestor of humans and chimp is thought to have lived on the continent of Africa in the early Oligocene, about 70 million years ago.  MUTUAL INTERACTIONS Between the animals are closely interwoven and animals have developed complex social interactions. Even though animals don’t communicate in sentences, they are still able to coordinate their actions. DETAILED INFO In nature things are usually very basic and everything is very concrete. Animals have very limited and specific memory, and they can memorise details without a lot of effort. The brain of a chimp is twice that of a human, and it is able to store more memories. The human brain is able to store only a limited number of details.  STUDENT INTERVENTION Humans in particular shouldn’t be too much of a trouble for chimpanzees."

Lenina reached the sidewalk and looked around. There was no-one else. She smiled, then grabbed the briefcase and grabbed the plane.","' 'Of course,' said the teenager. 'We could have used the lorry.' Then Lenina turned to them and smiled 'Yes,' the teenager said. 'But it would take forever and we are pretty tired.' 'Oh,' said the teenager with enthusiasm, 'but let's take it with us.' They looked around for the rest of the students and got some bags full with things that could bring on the plane with them. A teenage boy took them off and put them in a small backpack. Then they took it and walked toward the valley. They stopped at a small town that had a small lake. 'Would you like a tour' asked the man in charge. 'Yes,' said the teenager. A small hut came up with a small cabin and all the things needed to be taken on a plane. They got in and got their things and began traveling. Lenina was sitting on the chair and began to have terrible stomachs. Then a strange feeling came up and she got up. 'I'm going to the airport,' said she. They got off the small hut and walked up the stairs to the main street. Lenina began to have nausea and went to her room. She stayed there for a couple of hours and then she went downstairs. 'I'm at the airport,' said she. They got in and got on the plane. It took forever and they got tired. They got off in the small village they had stopped at. Then they took a small road to the farm. They got to the farm and got their things and started to travel. They got to the lake and took their things off and walked back to the hut. They left the hut and got their things on the plane and then they flew. They got off in the small village and walked up the stairs to the main street. Lenina was sitting on the chair and began to have terrible stomachs. Then a strange feeling came up and she got up. 'I'm going home,' she said. She got off the plane and went home. She went downstairs and got into the hut and went to her room. 'I'm home,' she said. She went downstairs and got into her room and...","' She looked at the two other teenagers she was seated with, both of whom looked miserable. Their clothes had stained with mud, their faces and clothing were covered with mud. Their hands, too, were stained with mud. Their backpacks were full of wet clothes and wet shoes. All they could think about was the food they had to eat that day. It would be hard to find any food to eat for several days. They looked at the group of teenagers who were sitting nearby them. Lenina also wanted to eat something that was fresh to be able to keep her hunger down. She felt that she wanted to eat what they were eating. What a pity that she didn't know that she had already lost three pounds. She sat down. The other teenagers who were seated with her looked at her with disgust. They didn't understand why she wanted to eat what the others were eating. They were just too weak to eat any of it, either. She thought: 'I have lost a large portion of my body weight due to the food I don't have to eat anymore.' 'I hate walking' she said again. The group of teenagers sat next to them turned to look at them, and then they realized they had done it. The group of teenagers sat next to them looked at them with disgust, and then they realized they had done it. They were both walking away from the group of teenagers sitting next to them. They didn't even think about who they were. Their eyes were looking down, their body moving slowly, they were walking away. They were walking away. Lenina was sad to see them go. They had never been to any other country but to Italy. They had never experienced any kind of war, they had never gone through any other kind of tragedy, but the first time they had been to Italy, they felt helpless and alone there.","'

'Yeah,' the young boy replied. He walked around the rock. 'I can hold my head up on this rock,' he smiled, and the air lifted his head. There were no words in his head. He then stood in the rock, as if he was a statue, for several minutes, or so. He was then gone. He was standing still like a statue or something.","' 'Well you don't have to,' said Tom after reading her look. He was in his red trousers as usual. He got out of his rucksack, took a long stride and walked up to the edge of the cliff. There he stood and took a deep breath. 'Here it comes now,' he said as he was about to walk over to the plane. But then... Something unexpected went wrong. 'Oh no,' thought Lenina, shaking her head. 'Now I am going to have to walk all the way back home.' Tom had to laugh as he walked out of the cliffs.","' she said again. 'We couldn't find any planes on the island.'

So far he is still waiting for that next flick to come together."," He spent a year in prison on false charges. And it wasn’t until the end of the year that he began to feel more optimistic. The Horse Whisperer was published on 1 December. By the time it was published a year ago it had already become the hottest book of the year. Evans was awarded the British Book Award 2012 and has published more than 10 novels and three collections of short stories. He says that writing in prison has taught him to be a better writer and that he is determined to keep writing as many books as he can. I just finished the final scenes of The Horse Whisperer, and at the end of it all I still believe I wrote it. ‘I know I did.’ He smiled. His story was inspired by the death of his grandfather, who was a very clever man. I spent a lot of time with him in his last days,’ said Nicholas. His grandfather, a soldier, had been shot dead in Iraq. He had an unusual story, because he hadn’t quite told the story to his mother. He told us a tale which had the unexpected twist of a murder that took place months before his death. In The Horse Whisperer, Nicholas writes about the trials and tribulations of a young man, who is given the chance to decide his own destiny in the novel. He struggles to determine his real identity and the way he wants to be seen. But it isn’t until the end of the book that Nicholas decides that he must make a choice for himself, and that his fate will be decided by one person. Nicholas was in prison during the writing process, as part of the writing of a screenplay for the movie The..."," In December he began to feel bad. He wasn't getting the number of writers he was aiming for in his first month. The problem started to grow as a result. He couldn't sleep because he kept dreaming of the money he was due. He began to get scared as soon as the money arrived. He was losing confidence that he was on his way. He had to start to push himself. He used to dream of writing a screenplay for his first film but he could never find time to write. He finally gave up dreaming and instead wrote screenplays. His most recent screenplay he has written for the BBC called the story of an unnamed man and his daughter after the family were wiped out by a virus. It is his very first screenplay. They have been nominated for a major award. He thinks that it could go very high in the running. He couldn't even think about what that was even going to be. It was about something completely unrealistic that came about by some strange accident. So then something real happened, something completely unexpected. In the meantime he had been writing the screenplay for about five months when the money was finally there. He thought that was a miracle. He was very excited. It had not gone well at all for the first few weeks when the money wasn't coming in. He started to panic and couldn't handle the pressure. The pressure was so great he couldn't even sleep. He had a sudden breakdown. He had no clue what the matter was. He was in the middle of a film and the pressure was enormous. He got off the phone and was in tears. He realised that it was because he was at the bottom of his life and he started to cry. He cried because he was about to go to the bottom of his own life.

He had this extraordinary story about a boy with a brain tumour who loved books and a beautiful blue scarf. He put it together in such a way that it moved me. The thing about him was he had an extraordinary imagination. He had an extraordinary imagination, yet he never said a word about it. He was very quiet. It was very lonely living in his apartment. At the time I thought what a wonderful story he had and that it couldn’t move me because I could not sympathize with him. But this made me wonder. Could I do that? I always wondered why I did not do that, why I did not write about him and what the world was missing. I thought I could be this great writer. When I read his story I just knew. So I made up an ending and I began to write. I wrote for three months on end. Nicholas Evans said he liked to write his books in two parts. His idea was that if you had finished reading a book one was not complete until you read the next one. It was very interesting and very exciting. I could not believe that this guy was right. It was amazing. I knew nothing of this author until I read his book and I felt like I could write it, but not at the same time. I had nothing in my life and I was miserable. This was a wonderful novel. I wrote that one book in one night. I thought he was wrong."," He had his novel published earlier than usual, which is why it took him an extra month to get his movie rights. That is a very rare treat for an early novel. When I told him about it he said he was surprised. Then he was surprised again that the film rights to The Horse Whisperer were being purchased by a movie company. But there was no mention of a pre-campaign like there was in The Handmaid's Tale. Now that he's in the director's chair the horse whisperer has gone on to become a cult classic. That is why I am so grateful to you for giving us a record for a first novel!

But Evans says he has not given up and now has signed a deal for a sequel: The Life of..."," He has been working like a dog and is now off halfway through writing his first novel and has decided to give up his dream of making films. He explains, 'I was only a little over eighteen when I realised I would never become an actual film-maker. In the end I was lucky the film business just never made sense. It's the same thing with writing novels. Writing about something like the war is just not a practical way to make money. The idea that anyone could write a book like The Horse Whisperer is ridiculous.' - Nicholas Evans
Next: A few years ago  The Horse Whisperer received two awards at the CELSR (Crawford English Language School Reading Festival)  These awards recognise excellent language and excellent literary achievement.   They were awarded because of the excellent quality of the manuscript and also because of the language of the book, using an excellent number of simple, direct, clear and concise linguistic devices.   Readers in this CEFR scale will not need to read further to get the main ideas of the book. The language is readable. It is a good book to begin with, a good book for a first language learner to learn English. In this CEFR scale we will consider if this book is a good text for this particular language learner. It is an excellent start."
C1, The last words of Marlowe are never lost in a rush and they show up right when they need to. There’s a sense of urgency about it that makes you feel part of the story. There’s a sense of pride in the execution of the performance. WICKED is a staging of the best of Terry Hands’ work and it puts him in another league of his own.," A riot. The first act is set at the last moment, but the drama goes on. The second act sees the murderers murdered, and a playboy who falls for another playboy. A third act full of intrigue, a fourth that is an all-time high, and a fifth that never stops (although it has an end). The sixth is an all-over-the-place battle that ends in triumph. The seventh is all about fighting in the street and a brawl with an army of knights. A ninth act is an all-rounder. The tenth is a dramatic death, which is followed by the coronation of the final henchman, the Great Marlowe. It is not the first time that Terry Hands has staged this production, but he has kept his ideas and themes in the text and presented them in a fresh and intriguing way. The plot is rich and complex, and the scenes are gripping and beautifully acted. He is a truly gifted director, and what he is bringing to life is a truly brilliant play."," Actor and director Terry Hands (pictured) has put his own spin on the play, but the character of Marlowe will remain the same with his last fight having been set in a warehouse and with the audience being given a taste of the wild west", He brings out the best in the most talented of actors and directors. Terry Hands brings his own vision for the role to life and the playwright seems to grasp the play’s power. The audience learns a lot. This is a production they will not want to miss.," In the first two acts one of these great chunks is a prologue, the opening scene of the play. This prologue contains the most powerful scenes in the whole play, including those by Marlowe and Shakespeare. They tell us about the times when people ruled England and were a threat to the peace of the country. As one of the last great plays of the Renaissance, Marlowe’s prologue still rings with dramatic authority. At one stage Marlowe and his brother-in-law, Prince of Castelet, the son of an old English knight, have their heads cut off. This act is the first act of Act one. He plays it and then Shakespeare’s. Shakespeare had never played it. The prologue of Marlowe’s play has been taken from the play of Marlowe and rewritten by him and his brother-in-law in their own language, which is all about power and its dangers. In the prologue of Marlowe’s play, Marlowe and the Prince talk about the dangers of power (at one point the Prince, looking at the dead Marlowe, asks, “Do not say, he is dead”). They speak about when they saw, what they felt, and why the Prince, who was not really a king, wanted to be. Marlowe has made changes to the play by making his own prologue, which we now see in Act one. The prologue of Shakespeare’s play, which we see in Act one, has been taken from the prologue of the play by his father, Hamnet. As one of the last great plays of the Renaissance, Shakespeare’s prologue still rings with dramatic authority. It has also been rewritten by the Prince of Castelet, but rewritten in his own language, all about power and its dangers. This prologue is not the prologue Marlowe used but something else, something..."," Stage directions and full score for The Great Marlowe by Terry Hands include page. 1. 1.5.1.

INTRODUCTION Marlowe is a warlike warrior whose exploits are told in ten acts. He was also a prolific writer, the creator of some of literature's most popular characters. Marlowe was an active participant in his time's politics, and it is implied that the playwright wrote it to show his sympathy for the political situation. THREEFOLD ANCIENT Theatrical Screenplay The Flesch-Kincaid Scale is a system used to evaluate works of literature based on the words, sentences, and syllables in a play. This scale was developed by Clarence F. Kincaid in the 1930s to help students and teachers with reading comprehension of plays. According to the system, Flesch-Kincaid grade level indicates how many words, sentences, and syllables make up a play. The Flesch-Kincaid Scale also provides an overall score that is based on the play's reading level. The Flesch-Kincaid Scale is the most commonly used scale for evaluating plays on a reading level. However, some readers may use other scales or grade levels if they prefer. THREEFOLD ANCIENT In the play The Great Marlowe, playwright Terry Hands uses a number of strategies in the story to help readers understand the play. He offers flashbacks, presents the action rapidly, and introduces characters with dialogue and scenes. The Great Marlowe includes a number of dialogues, which include", His production leaves no room for weakness as it celebrates an important historical figure and the triumph of the English language. He presents a great stage play that is a wonderful journey from the first person to the third. A stage show by Terry Hands with a running time of between two and three hours.

C1," It’s a dangerous undertaking, for the reasons just described, as well as because of the growing dominance of the new media. No one knows the future of print newspapers. But when it comes to online newspapers, that is a much different story – and no one knows what lies ahead. But what is possible, and what is not? I have no idea. There is, perhaps, some truth in Peter Preston’s belief that what’s possible might be so strange and frightening as to defy belief. We are living in a strange age and the newspaper has not always been like it. The next major social development is that the newspaper has been sold for a long time. The last time I remember selling newspapers was in the 1950s."," And that is what this story is about. Peter Preston, the director of The Sun, recently announced that he has quit The Sun. Mr. Preston took the post at the paper in May, and has promised to make the paper an online-only newspaper until 2015. He had a change of heart and quit at the end of June – just a few days before The Sun had celebrated its 70th anniversary. So the question is: what exactly is behind the sudden change of direction in Mr. Prestin’s life? He said he believes the paper would be better off without him. After a year in which Mr. Preston has faced difficult decisions, he believed the paper would be better off without him. He did not want to leave the Sun, but the paper would be better off without him. No question that it was important for Mr. Preston to leave The Sun. In his last report before quitting, Mr. Preston said The Sun had been in the midst of a major restructure. His new approach to the paper has not gone down well with the old guard. Mr. Prestin had to confront an old order within the company. In a rare interview, Mr. Preston revealed the reason behind his decision to leave – in an almost confessional format. In the interview, Mr. Preston said that the newspaper had been in a period of crisis for many years. Mr. Preston said he has had to make a difficult decision to end The Sun. In the interview, Mr. Preston said his new approach to the paper has not gone well with the old guard. In the interview, Mr. Preston said he had to make a difficult decision to end The Sun"," The question is: will newspapers continue to exist? What is the problem with newspapers? None of these answers in fact. Just like any of our present choices our newspapers, and the online newspapers that have gone with them, will go to the other side of the screen. All we need do is take a few more deep breaths and get ready."," In the future newspapers will only offer a few types of articles in print – a few online articles – and few online sources. Most other areas of the newspaper may go online. As for articles in print newspapers, they might feature a bit more words that could not have been used in the printed versions – but words of their own. As the internet grows so may the print pages – and so may newspaper content. Newspaper content is not a digital content but a combination of two very different media: text and visual images. In the future the printed edition of newspapers may simply disappear. But it will not be replaced by websites because websites are too complicated to give a comprehensive account of newspaper content. To be precise: a newspaper website may be content, but it is not a newspaper. For instance, on a news website, news articles are published online but a picture may also be published there and in the printed version. What about the text? A newspaper website may give text to be read by users, but they are not reading newspapers. They are reading websites! The Internet will also have a place for a newspaper that can still be found on print. The printed version of the newspaper may still be published and sell newspapers. The website may provide the news stories, but they will be available both in print and online. Some companies might have a newspaper called a magazine and publish it in both formats. Newspaper companies may be forced to keep some websites in print in order to attract readers."," You can find out more in the Daily Mail online. Transition is the word that has come through the press this week. Not only that, the transition means what change means. It means moving from something, usually something physical, to something else and not always pleasant. A newspaper's transition from a printed, newspaper-style form to an online version – which means it has to write itself. It means moving to an online platform – where it now has to write itself – because it has lost its main source of revenue – newspapers. It means not being able to change easily, because it has to meet the demands of an audience and not just those of its advertisers. And yet another thing: transition means that the newspaper is going from there to nowhere, because it still needs to provide its basic core content – news and information, and stories for that matter. There are of course other words that come to mind, but they are too general and not good enough for a newspaper. So, change is a phrase that I think would suit a newspaper, because it is something that goes on and on and on, and is something that always brings a lot of people together. There is a huge debate among newspapers about whether to let change happen – and whether this should be their main reason to make a newspaper or to avoid it as a factor in the future. It may be a good word for newspapers and a word that has come through the press this week, but it is not necessarily good for the editor."," As a journalist, I hope to see that transition move from a difficult and daunting task to a much more achievable and pleasant one. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scores: 1.9/1.7."," For the most part, transition is a necessary event. It’s like moving a book from print to electronic format. It takes some time. Peter Preston Transition. The end of print may take some time. Peter Preston Transition. It’s a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless that is it is newspapers’ ‘transition’ to the online world an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process – because frankly it may not be a process at all. For the most part, transition is a necessary event. It’s like moving a book from print to electronic format. It takes some time."

C1," I meet a rather handsome man with a long darkish haired beard and bushy eyebrows, who talks a lot about a very high-ranking position he will one day hold in the Cabinet. It's a bit of a strange situation I admit, so do my fellow shoppers as we gather around him. 'Yes I am from Liverpool,' says my fellow shoppers, laughing nervously. I know this is a bit out of character in East London, but as a city we all want to seem interesting. At any rate, Charles Hurst asks me to sit down and we go through my project for an hour. We have some coffee and cakes while the conversation continues. At a certain point his assistant asks me to bring him an exact copy of the plans for the interior of the new home Joanna Watt is to be given. 'I need to keep it a secret,' he says in a voice which indicates that he is not a secretive person. I shake my head and nods as I head for my home. I walk into the home and there, right at the end of the hallway, I see a woman who looks just like Joanna, standing beside a chair in her bedroom. It is me, Joanna Watt. The two of us face each other as a light bulb goes on. In a moment, the kitchen is transformed to the kitchen we will all live in."," Hurst's home has been in the same place since the 18th Century, and has never looked very different since. A large building at the heart of West Ham with a glass-fronted office block in front and a courtyard on the side. This home has stood the test of time but still a part of the modern world. It may have a slightly less modernised furniture, but it is still all that it should be. This is the real me. I feel rather nervous around a large man in front of me, but I quickly warms up to his company, and he is a perfect gentleman. It is no surprise that his workshop is tucked beneath a railway arch, but how well is this hidden? He is in fact at the base of a small staircase and walks up the flight of stairs and down the wooden steps with us. I hear a man on the stairs saying something to the man in the next room but I cannot make out what it is until it is over. The man in the next room is asking a different question but he answers in the same vein. I find this interesting, as he seems to know everything that is happening. I do not realise this at the time but it is now clear. I sit down at the chair and get comfy in front of the desk which is sitting behind the arch. The chair is very comfortable and the desk is very tidy, but it still gives me the impression of being a desk and not a chair. The only other chair I see in the room is that of the main floor, but I cannot see the woodwork of the chair from this angle. I am not sure if it is because I cannot see it from a certain angle but I feel it may be a bit less tidy than the chair next to it. Charles Hurst makes a living with perfectly crafted furniture and the quality and finesse of what he does is just amazing. He is...","The cabinetmaker takes the time to explain each component of his designs but is not at all slow-witted.  He is a great story-teller. My first impulse is to ask his advice on a piece of furniture, although I'm more of an interior designer rather than a furniture fan.He gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop tucked under a railway arch in East London and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him"," The furniture is made with precision, so much so, that a pair of his customers are quite certain he has built them before. Their faces are illuminated by the pride, the sense of accomplishment and their delight when I am allowed to walk behind them to take a first look at their pieces. All are well made, beautifully finished, and in keeping with what I am used to seeing from the market in Britain. I am told the business will not be here for long, so the customers must be feeling very comfortable in their purchase. Their eyes are locked on me as I walk off, but only for a moment. I am shown around the yard to see how the pieces are made from the moulds, to see the wood being turned by the carpenter. The scene is well worth it. The job is all in one day and not the usual 12 hours at the factory. I sit for several hours at a table with a large wooden desk, surrounded by a large number of chairs. It is the same desk that the customers are sitting on as they enjoy their chairs. In front of me I am shown a shelf of handmade products, all made from beautiful wood and covered in delicate leather. The selection is remarkable, but what is also extraordinary is the quality of the leather and wood: so light, so smooth it looks like it is from a very young tree, the furniture is light as well and yet still remarkably strong. I am shown how the chair is made from the upholstery of a suit. This is an old trick that Hurst uses in all of his work - he starts with the right product, chooses a fabric that will withstand the weather and the use and tear, then..."," The next day, I find out that as a student of art history Charles Hurst specialises in woodworking. If you want to know more I ask him about his passion for furniture. 'I'm fascinated by the creation of artwork. In fact it was always meant to be a part of me. My father was a cabinet maker, so I was always surrounded by pieces of furniture, both from his work and also bought new ones.'  And so it was that, while at uni, my eyes were trained towards a particular type of piece of furniture. They were very much drawn to the legs of chairs and the way these joints of wood are glued into shape. 'I just always wanted to try the process of woodworking on my own. So when I discovered that there was an apprenticeship available at the Royal College of Arts, I took it'..."," As I walk in, I observe him with an even more anxious appearance than the previous day. There is a slight unease and tension in his expression. He and Joanna face each other. He asks about her work. Joanna tells him about her recent arrival. He asks if she's had any difficulty fitting in while working in the industry. His eyes narrow and she laughs, his expression clearing. She says that she is glad to be in business, that she's a lovely person and he does not need to worry about her work's quality. Joanna asks him if he has any time to learn the business of making fine furniture. His expression is tense and he responds that he has had enough. A few moments later, he asks her if she has seen the latest collection of the same type of furniture. Joanna shrugs. His expression returns to his usual nervous one, then he says it doesn't look good. Joanna asks him if he still has any time to learn. His expression stays the same. Joanna Watt's work has been selected to feature in the exhibition 'Good for England' at the Royal Victoria Gallery in London. In this text, Charles Hurst is the name of the man who wants to learn about Joanna Watt's work."," The story is a love story but it has plenty of drama, a lot of kissing, a few passionate arguments and some very long discussions."
C1, The second surprise is Clover’s discovery of a secret passage in the cathedral which leads him and the audience to the underground drainage system of the medieval building.," The second is the home of British author Charles Clover, which has two bedrooms and a garage connected to the living room. Southwell Minster is a Grade II listed building which has been converted into an eco-apartment, but not for the cheapest of customers. This is why Southwell Minster is worth an inspection for a first-time visitor. The site, which dates back to the year 1086, is home to the cathedral, the chapter house and the medieval hall. It is also home to Clover's novel, 'Green Man'. Southwell Minster"," The next surprise is the fact that in this house there is no toilet in the modern bedroom! This is for the protection of the living quarters from the strong solar energy and the firewalls of glass are there to block out harmful radiation. In fact, Southwell was recently ranked number one in the Britain’s ‘least-known ancient cathedral' by The Times."," There is the ancient Roman aqueduct (which is now the site of a supermarket) which, together with the modern ‘Solar Garden’ at the centre of the cathedral, is one of the UK’s first two green spaces. The second is the Solar Garden which can be enjoyed in full sunlight for as long as six hours a day as well as being equipped with solar street lights and solar pumps to supply water, all powered by the sun. The garden is home to a solar pool which also has solar lights and is equipped with solar water pumps. A solar pool and two other green spaces are being made available to the public on the first day of the UK’s first Green House and Gardens Fair. The fair, which takes place on Thursday 15 July from 11:00am to 8:00pm, offers people an opportunity to explore green energy, green homes and other green technologies in the UK. The first day of the fair is being dedicated to ‘The planet is the home of all life’."," A large garden filled with old woodland and flowers, with a river running through it. But what makes the environment of this home most beneficial is a roof made from solar panels. This means that the home has solar energy. It also saves on energy costs, as the roof doesn't have to be heated as it catches warm air from the earth and cools it in the winter. Charles Clover is going to see the interior of this green home, and in doing so finds out why it is one of the oldest buildings in England, and why it is so friendly to the environment. A passage in the Guardian reported that it is England's oldest green building. It has been in the family for a century, and Charles Clover will visit the interior of this home which was built by a British immigrant. I understand that Charles is a photographer. In doing so, he will be able to see how he could make this home even more beneficial to the environment, what can he learn, and whether or not his efforts could save his family money.", Charles Clover's book will be a good fit for a grade 3 to 4 level. It is a long poem. It has several sub-sections. It includes a few images but is mostly text., The first is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral Southwell Minster celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of 'green' men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house.

The Ancient Chinese method of applying acupuncture involves the use of needles with a diameter less than 0.1 inches (0.25cm) to deliver a precise amount of pressure to specific areas of the body. Many people use acupuncture to treat their own pain because it is believed to help reduce and sometimes eliminate pain. This is what many people think of when they think about acupuncture. However, there is something else going on under the skin. In many cultures, acupuncture has been part of healing for thousands of years. For many of those years, acupuncture has been used to treat a wide range of medical conditions, including pain. In addition to providing pain relief and relaxation, acupuncture also has a significant impact on the body’s ability to feel pain. In many cultures, acupuncture has been a method of healing.

C1," It was a wonderful cover for what it was meant to be, a love story between a gay man and a straight man. On the inside of the magazine the story was unflattering.", When Carter told her he wanted to take her back to New Orleans in December he promised that she wouldn't be the last time he'd have sex with her (in his Porsche). They made love in his Porsche.," The September cover of the same magazine featured a different Clay Carter: living in a cheap apartment, looking down, lonely with his wife and child, struggling with a debt to the state.  What was Clay Carter's secret?"," He lived in the same house, wore Armani, drove a Porsche, and spent all his time boating. How do you know that this was Clay Carter? Because he lives in that house."," The March cover of Cosmopolitan featured his mother, the actress Annette Turner, with a small black-and-white picture of them hugging in bed. To the left of the picture were the photographs of them driving their limousines in Paris, Italy, and the Bahamas, with the caption, ""They've been enjoying the holidays with their little boy."" Clay Carter is a man now known for the car he owns, the boat he has been buying, the luxury apartment he has, and most importantly, the dog he has. He is also known as a convicted felon.
Carter was convicted in 2004 of two counts of simple assault with the intent to rob, after he had been armed with an 8mm hollow-point handgun on a shopping trip to New York City. He was ordered to serve 1,100 days in jail and $2,400 in restitution. The judge said that he was not to be used as a ""model criminal"" but as a ""personal learning tool"". Now he is living in a converted shed on a street in a small town in Pennsylvania.
After a lengthy stay at the Pennsylvania State Hospital, Carter was transferred to the Pennsylvania State Correctional Facility for Women, a facility in Philadelphia that houses a population of more than 900 women awaiting sentencing. The ward is a block from the prison where his mothers and sisters reside. Although he is a convicted felon, it is common knowledge that he has lived with the girls since he was 12 years old, sharing the same room as his mother, his sister, and two younger brothers until he was 19. His mother was a divorced actress who also served as the lead actress in a television show. Carter's sisters are still minors, and he and his mother are still in regular contact with them. The ward is large, but it is very quiet. After being transferred from the prison where he was awaiting sentencing, Carter was given the nickname ""Psycho Clay"", and he was told that in order to avoid reprisals, he would not leave his room.
Around the corner from the prison are houses where former prisoners are allowed to live, but not under formal rules, or to be granted custody of their children. The prisoners who live there, with the exception of a handful of women who have their own rooms, are typically the same people Carter would come...", The December cover of Capitol Magazine featured Clay Carter looking rich and handsome in his expensive Armani suit.

C1," And it seems that sleep might be in such demand that the human body has developed three theories. In this way of thinking people may sleep less. The Sleep deprivation theory: This theory says that sleep might be a requirement for our well being and well-being. In fact, sleep might be the most important thing in our lives. This is why it is hard to see why people sleep less. Although people cannot function without sleep, this theory may not be entirely true, however. Another theory, The Constraint on Sleep, holds that as humans reach old age, the body becomes increasingly limited by its ability to sleep. The third theory, The Benefits of Unrestricted Sleep, holds that as humans become older, there is more to gain from sleeping for more hours. Who wants to go to sleep?", People spend one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain therefore that sleep has a vital function. However what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep.," Theories about sleep include:

Late night (and more sleep): One theory says that people need to wake up before the body gets tired. They get more sleep."," Sleep: The Three theories to consider: One view says sleep is important to keep people in a healthy state for the activity of their bodies. Another says sleep is important to repair and replenish cells in the body. The third view holds that sleep improves mental performance and improves our mood. All of these theories are worthy of consideration, but for now it is simply the case that sleep helps maintain the body’s health. Question: What happens to the cells in your body? Answer not in context", Question: In how many theories are these three Sleep? Three theories. Question: How many theories are sleep's three theories? Three. Question: How many theories are sleep three theories," They have suggested that sleep is more about getting used to the environment. They even argue that sleep is a physiological state and it helps improve physical health. Some believe sleep is used as a means for dealing with difficult thoughts. The most powerful theory about sleep is that sleep is about getting used to the environment. Aside from being used as a means to get used to the environment, sleep is also considered physiological state. However, this does not help the sleep itself. Scientists say it is not just that the body gets rid of the unwanted and unwanted thoughts. Scientists also claim that sleep is used as a means of relieving stress. However, these arguments do not help sleep. The main reason for why we are so passionate about sleep is that it is a vital function. The function of sleep is used as a way of getting used to the environment. However, it also helps improve physical health.", They also don't quite agree on whether sleep is bad for us or good for us:   A scientist said the best thing to do after you get into bed is to tell yourself that your body is full of blood and energy. He said that if you can find a way to put this in your mind you will have enough energy to keep going through the night. Scientist said that sleeping doesn't help you think. He also said that when you wake up in the morning your brain reacts to how long you've been asleep. Scientist said that sleeping is a necessary part of life.
C1," We also included a writer who wanted to find out what writing was going on. These people were given the same questions. As the questions were asked our panel was asked to compare the working environment in all four offices. How the answer to these questions would give us clues as to whether or not the office atmosphere was healthy and happy at all. The four contrasting offices were a medical office, a tech office, a financial office and a real estate office. The opinions of our panel are all pretty much in agreement: It was not good enough to get the best results. They were all a health hazard.

Question: What will be interesting about the four offices?"," Each of the four offices had a similar style of design; they were all the same size and located in a same location. The only distinction was that one of them had air conditioning in each office, while the other didn't. Air conditioning was deemed to be a good thing by everyone involved with the office, whether it made employees feel comfortable in the heat or cool in the winter. But is it possible to be healthy and happy all at the same time? Working on a computer all day for nine to five might make you happy, but you might not be making the most of your life. Did you know that the stress of working for someone else can contribute to burnout, and a negative outlook on work can cause unhappiness?"," We started by asking what it was that made them happy as office workers. Everyone answered with something similar but slightly different. People said that things like good working conditions, good breaks, healthy food and friendly people made them happy at work. We didn’t know how to measure the health or happiness of the people so we got the experts together to measure the health and happiness of the teams of people. The team of experts went to the offices and assessed how well the office worked and how much time they spent on different activities at work. When the team walked around the office, they took video of each of the activities done and were measuring a person’s work productivity. This was done to see the quality of the working day, which in turn meant how happy the people were as working environments. They also took pictures of the employees as well to look at how they looked, so that they could match it to the video of them working. People would spend up to seven hours a day working in the offices. The team of experts walked around the offices and took video of the people working at their desks. There were also plenty of pictures taken to compare the employee’s work to the video of their desks.

I got a text from my sister the next morning. ‘Why didn’t you tell me you were quitting?’ she asked. ‘If I hadn’t said anything - it would have been called a success.’ I have been smoking for 40 years and never once thought the truth about why I had been smoking."," Anyway, she was on the warpath and insisted that I quit smoking. She had been smoking cigarettes for many years. Then I decided that, if she was in control of my life at that moment, perhaps I might be willing to stop smoking. I did that for one day and had nothing to show for it. I returned to my normal routine, smoking in my car, in the office, after work, etc. The next day I didn’t like the taste of my mouth when I smoked that much more. And the next day, the next, I couldn’t bear to smoke a cigarette in the first place. I have now quit for eight years."," But all I had to do was keep breathing and swallow my tongue - just like I always did in my early years of smoking. For more information, visit https://www.flesch.co.uk/.", She finally admitted that the best thing I could do for herself and everyone else was to give up smoking. ‘But why didn’t you stop before?’ asked the furious colleague. I couldn’t explain. I was too embarrassed to say anything else.
C2, When I started typing for work I wrote a lot. The first thing I learned is that typing in the word processor makes you write a lot longer than you would have done in hand. It also eliminates the ability to see where a line crosses over itself.," I used a much more effective method of typing the same paragraph. Writing on screen was quite easy too with the right keyboard. If only that I would have used it now! As the text continued to grow it became evident I needed to edit, edit, edit. One by one I took out paragraphs I didn’t like and added some content which I thought would enhance the story. It became apparent after about 20 edits that there were certain themes that were repeated too many times, I needed to include more unique content for the story to succeed. At this point I realized that my original goal was to have one idea dominate the story, this wasn’t happening. At the end of the edit I thought I would try one last edit on the theme the writer wanted to emphasize at the beginning of the story. It came out better than I thought, but there were no crossings-out at all. After the first edit I thought maybe I have wasted a lot of time on the first edit. I decided to re-read the entire story one last time to see if I found anything of value that could be included in the story. No surprises here! The writer tried to make the story come alive by including some original thoughts."," One word for an extra one would have been enough, even for the best of us. For that I thanked the fact that I was a boy at the time, and that I was writing for the ‘right’ purpose. That was always the first point of the argument. A more successful story starts off with a plan and a method. I had been inspired by the success of a story which was written in the style of Ayn Rand. The plot was simple. We were in a town where a rich white widow (she called herself herself the Duchess) had left her heir, the son of a local butler (he was called the Baron), to live away from his home with his older sister. The Duchess had written that he would find himself in a new country, where the English language would be very hard to learn. She advised him to learn a foreign language before he found his country, and to forget everything he had learned in England. To this end he was invited to an english language school where he would study the art of writing. It was all planned by the Duchess, with the help of a clever and helpful English tutor. She had even prepared a very specific vocabulary. There was also a very specific way she wanted the character to change, and the character's life would be transformed. And to make sure that the English language was also changed, the teacher (he was called the Lord) would change the language, too. If you wanted to know a man and his own story, then there was always one way that you could find out, he would tell you everything he had been told before...."," I would have deleted so many lines. For the same work I could have written it much more neatly on a word processor and it would have been much more quickly done. For example it took me over an hour to copy from my own handwritten notes on a notebook to Word processor. Writing by hand in any type of style seems to be harder than writing by screen, and for any subject. It is harder because writing on a piece of paper demands a greater concentration. The brain, eyes, fingers and hand are all in motion as you write. The brain and the eye are used together. You are using all four senses. You’re focusing all the senses as you write. It’s not just a matter of concentrating on the thing you are writing, it’s about using all your senses in a controlled manner, like if you were driving on a highway or in a crowded elevator. In the handwriting, you are focusing on each particular word, in the word processor you concentrate on each particular word and you could get faster, but you’d have a lot more blanks. It is much more difficult. There is a sense of urgency and purpose because of the effort required to put your handwriting down. It takes more effort to put down your handwriting. Now look at some of my handwritten notes and some of my writing on computer and they’re similar. It isn’t like I am being too clever. It is just that it takes me much less effort to write on computer. I don’t want to be clever. I am just more diligent. I am trying to write with less effort and I know the results will be much more successful in the long term. It is easier to write with a computer and it is easier to do it..."," The handwritten words are clearly seen and the text looks neatly typed on a computer screen. That’s what makes good writing great. For the next time you’re thinking about writing your own text, it’s worth remembering what Dr Johnson said about writing."," But the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scale makes this all easier. By scoring each word, sentence, and syllable based on its Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, it helps students to read and write clearly and also learn to understand. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scale is a method of scoring language that has been used in education since at least the 1940s."," Explicit information and limited number of information points

C2," Tide pools could not be discerned in the sluggish water; so my pace slackened and I paused to consider where to go next. I pulled up to a street called West Philly that seemed to give way to the East Philly in a sudden split. My gaze fell on a tall apartment building, and I found myself thinking that one of the windows was open as I stepped out of the shadows. I looked across the street at one corner, and saw a shadow. I knew it was there; it was the shadow of a child walking with his mother. There was a silhouette of the boy in a parked car, and their child looked at me. Their eyes fell on the shadow and they laughed. I looked at my watch. It was close to 11pm. How could this be? The shadows seemed very real, and it was not a trick of light. What was happening in the park? The street was dark. I wondered if I could see any more of the kids. They did not seem to be paying any attention to the noise of my steps, as if they were too busy being themselves. In my heart I wondered, What do they know that I do not know? Who do they know that I do not know?"," There were no cars yet streaked through the middle of Philadelphia Avenue. I knew it was about time I hit the alley where I knew a man would be waiting for me. In the darkness of the alley, I could hear his breathing and breathing. A moment later, I walked into the shadows and he stood tall on his stool."," I wanted to catch up with a stranger before night fell. A light was on outside, but I would stare up with that stranger without knowing the face of my own. That night the light went off.

Just a few steps along the broad sidewalk, I saw someone approaching the road. She paused to walk slowly up to the roadway, but the other thing she noticed that caused her to pause was the presence of a man who seemed to be making a move towards her. I noticed he was wearing a dark blue t-shirt with an unreadable message on the front, like the ones you see on graffiti. He looked pretty confident in his bearing. She turned back and walked off, quickly and confidently, leaving me with the impression this could be the same person. After a few moments, he turned around and walked back towards me. This time, he put his hands on his hips and shook them, and then he put a hand on his hip a few inches up from my ankle and pushed forward to me with a few of his large hands, making sure he was getting me. He reached down and pulled my ankle to the side of the road and held me there for a few seconds, until I was completely exhausted. He shook his head and smiled at me, then I slowly relaxed into his grip. I was sitting in his arms in shock, my arms wrapped around him and the weight of his arms on my waist. I felt something hit the side of my head, and my eyes opened and I found myself lying on the side of the road. My face was up and his mouth was down on me. He laughed and I thought his expression was pretty much the same. He held me tight and I felt his warmth pouring down over me. I tried to find something to help myself, but there was nothing I could have done with my eyes open. And all of a sudden, I was lost in the arms of a man. I had never before experienced a sexual encounter, and that..."," There, on the cobblestones, a little boy walked with his mother. As the woman left, the boy asked her what she did for a living."," The street was quiet with the last of the cars in the city lights on a single streetlamp drifting through the sky on the other side of the street, which was empty save for an empty house in the middle of the thoroughfare. I slumped my chin down between my arms and stared at my strangers..."," The shadow of a black shadow moved, and its owner was approaching. At a glance, I could see the man in a dark suit was wearing a distinctive pattern, and I knew it was one of the crooks. I kept my cool, and at once I heard a shout of surprise. “Where are you!” the crook shouted out, looking as though I had just stabbed him. I reached in one hand to cover my mouth. “There!” I responded, quickly pulling back the handkerchief I was wearing and making a grimace, as if saying something about the smell that came from the handkerchief. “Well done,” he said. “Yes,” I nodded, laughing at the idea of the other sneaking up behind me and grabbing my handkerchief. “Haven't you got a knife?” he said, taking a pocket knife from his back. “Who is that?” I asked, making sure not to look up or speak to him. I hoped the other had got a knife; I'd hate to have it stolen for me."

Scientists and mathematicians have long known his contributions. Einstein's father was a chemist. He helped work on chemical plants. His mother worked as a seamstress. It was in the sewing class when Einstein met his future wife, Clara. Albert Einstein was born on August 26, 1879. Einstein taught physics and mathematics at the University of Zurich. Einstein became interested in mathematics when he was 10 years old and became the youngest student to receive the first prize of an international competition for solving the equation x + 3 = 7."," Albert Einstein was a physicist who researched gravity and had his name associated with many products. He made predictions and found out how gravity affects the Earth and other celestial bodies. Einstein’s name is still used in many places today. But he also developed a scientific philosophy which was later incorporated into the theory of relativity. He lived from 1919-1984, and is credited with laying the foundations of modern physics. Einstein was born in Germany on April 20, 1879.  A man in Einstein’s age group is generally well educated. Einstein was a gifted young physicist. He started as a student of Rudolf Virchow at Göttingen University but moved to Berlin after a time. Einstein was the second son of a rich banker and inventor (Johann Philipp Albert Einstein) who had been born in 1864. Einstein’s mother was a teacher of geology and Greek. She was married to Philipp Einstein (b. 1856). They had three children including Albert Einstein. Philipp Einstein left Germany after Einstein’s father died. Einstein’s mother was allowed to stay in Germany until her death on March 26, 1935, when the family moved back to Germany. Einstein was also well educated at home in his childhood. His parents read him poetry and talked about music. He was taught about music from an early age and became interested in violin. He took violin lessons in the youth. Albert Einstein’s younger brother Paul joined the Göttingen University where he learned calculus and mathematics. Paul joined Göttingen University in 1877, but dropped out in 1879 after failing to make his grades. Albert Einstein began his studies at Göttingen University in 1880.

He graduated with a degree in mathematics from the University of Jena and began his career as a mathematician at a chemical company where he worked for five years. When the factory moved to Munich and he joined the Munich Baroque Orchestra, Einstein discovered the joy of music and took it to his work, developing his theory of relativity, which he proved independently a year later. He was knighted by Hitler in 1938 for his work as a chemist. He became a famous and wealthy scientist, although it was only later that he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics."," Einstein was born in Switzerland.

C2, You will also find many different books available on the subject. The need to make charts and catalogue was greatly diminished.

The range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need.," The library of the astronomer's home, with books on various subjects, is a great resource for amateur astronomers. In the past, books were bought or borrowed. It was expensive. Some of them cost money, especially when they were scarce.

Nowadays, most pupils begin their journey in astronomy with a very little knowledge of astronomy. Their knowledge of astronomy gradually increases as they read about it, learn more about the history of it and work through more difficult topics. A typical day In the past, astronomers learnt their job by following their specialities. Astronauts learnt astronomy and space exploration. Mathematicians learnt astronomy and astrology. Scientists learnt astronomy and science. Astronomers learnt astronomy and space exploration. Nowadays, teachers in many schools have started teaching astronomy as part of the natural sciences. They introduce this material as an optional extra. In some schools, astronomy is only taught as an optional part of science. It can be found throughout the curriculum in many subjects. Most of the modern teaching of astronomy is concerned with the visual aspect of astronomy. The first few chapters in textbooks describe the Earth, its history and its present day status.

C2," For me, art is a tool for making sense of the world. My art is rooted in our struggles with ourselves and how we define others. For me, art is the perfect example of how history is told."," We admire the man who was an outsider and was also revolutionary. Our admiration for art is almost a fetish, almost obsessive. Art - whether modern or ancient - needs people to rebel against it to make something new. In order to do this, it is often the work of outsiders, rebels, rebels against those who rule. These rebels are often viewed negatively. And yet, the thing is that the artist is often the most revolutionary person in the world. Because they make a statement, because of the radicalism of the vision or idea or image - the artist is often the most revolutionary person in the world. But we often make a bad comparison between the work of art, the artistic revolution, and the revolutionary movement in general. In other words, we equate artistic revolution with the revolutionary movement. It's very easy for us to equate artistic revolution with revolutionary revolution, a movement that is a bit overblown, the kind that we look forward and wish to participate in, the type of movements that we look for in this day and age. The truth is, artistic revolution is not very revolutionary at all. Rather it is more about the ideas and images that come across. Art is meant to be revolutionary, its main goal is to challenge, to excite and to stir people into action. Art is meant to make us want to stand up and fight. It's meant to change our consciousness. It's meant to change our outlook on life and on the world. Art is meant to be revolutionary. And yet, what do we do to honor art? We praise it and we admire it - but do we really make a difference? Do we even live the vision that the artist has portrayed in their work? And this is where it becomes a bit confusing. We...", The artist is now almost like an outlaw.

By the early twentieth century, it was viewed as a product of bourgeois society with little meaning to working class or poor. This history and its implications will be discussed in the body text. The development of fashion was seen as heavily dependent upon nineteenth and twentieth century capitalism for its development, it was always dependent upon capitalism for its growth and development."," At this point in history, the industry was a part of the commercial and technological base in the city that gave people access to clothing. This was a crucial time in the history of the fashion industry. In fact, fashion changed the whole face of a city. Fashion is very much associated with the rise of large fashion houses and their production of clothing for the masses."," Most historians have focused on fashion as a modern phenomenon, and as it exists today in the sense of the clothes worn by individuals, although they have been quite reluctant to consider fashion from an economic perspective. It is hard to imagine the life of a fashion designer without knowing what is available at the time."," In the beginning, however, fashion seemed to be almost all in the realm of the individuals, a phenomenon which was in sharp contrast to the emerging market economy.

C2," In the dark room of a museum, in a garden of a house, in a tree, the flowers, the grass, the trees, even the rocks, the clouds, they all inspired me to capture their power and beauty. The water. The river which runs through Vienna was especially appealing. I took lots of pictures of its surface as it danced along the walls of the city. It was very important to me. It inspired me to imagine that these pictures would be lost if I failed to capture their essence. I remember as a student that one of my teachers asked me to photograph the river running through Vienna. He was a bit of a strict disciplinarian. He did not like to be disturbed. He used a single stop motion camera to take pictures. He said the river had a unique power. He made it into a national artwork. It must be photographed by students when they went out into the country and he would always have a special place in the studio for the pictures. One year I was the only student photographing the river. I was supposed to photograph everything I saw in that day. And while I was out on a bicycle, the sky suddenly began to fall with heavy showers. I was in the museum. I could not stop to photograph. I had to photograph something. And because I was not allowed to film my trip at the museum, I decided to shoot video instead. And although it was far from a professional video, it did show me how much I love that place."," Photographs are not easy, but if done properly they are easy. It is a process of putting all your heart, soul, brain and soul into it. And yes...if you are into it. My main purpose in Vienna is to continue this project. To tell the story, through the lens. It is a new series of photos which I want to finish within 3 months to have something to look back to in a decade. The stories that I want to tell through these photographs have always been my main purpose in Vienna. For the same reason I have not been back here in the last few weeks. This time I will stick to the one thing I have always done and that is to travel. To travel I went to Austria with another friend who is from London, a fellow photographer. While I think I am already back home, Austria is on another level."," Photographs could never be taken too often, they were always precious. It took three years to get my first award for photographic fiction, which was in Venice. I didn't want to get rich at the time. But I did want to get rich from it. I was happy there."," Every aspect of photography was to me an experience. I could walk a dozen kilometres through the streets of Vienna without seeing anything worth photographing. Even walking in the garden of the opera house didn't yield a good view of the stage. The view is obstructed by a garden wall and large foliage. Vienna was an excellent city for a student. The students, although few, did come from all over Europe and America, and students from other parts of the world came as well. Every street was full of students, and everything was crowded. The noise and excitement was constant. There were also many events at the opera house, concerts and musical performances were held all around the week. I didn't mind, but I wanted to photograph every moment of the performance and the audience."," At one point I had the idea to become a photographer. I wanted to go to Vienna for a photo-shoot. As a long-standing student of photography I knew exactly what I needed to do to get there. But one thing kept standing in the way of my goals - the costs. In my first year, I spent more than a quarter of a million marks to study photography. My second year my figure was half of that. This had a large effect on my family and my financial circumstances. So I decided that the most important thing for me, in order to reach my goal, was a job. With that in mind, I applied for a job. I was lucky. Within a month I had found a job as a photojournalist in Vienna. That was a big turning point, and I was determined to fulfil my ambition. I wanted to be a photographer, so what was to stop me?"," When I took photographs of myself, my subjects, and my surroundings, I often found that I was able to capture, in the simplest forms, the fullest forms of emotion and imagination. As long as I was able to keep the film in my hand, I knew I would find the greatest joy in life."," On my trip to Vienna I took pictures. As I walked the streets, I noticed that a little man walking on crutches was not being looked at by anyone else but me. His name was Peter. Peter asked me why I was taking pictures. I said, ""Just to see things in a new way."" In reply, he said he did not like to be stared at. That was when I realised how strong the relationship we had with each other: he was being stared at. I started to take pictures of Peter walking in the city centre. He was looking for someone he could talk to when he lost his balance. And I was looking for someone else to photograph in case he stumbled and made a mistake."
C2," But do we really know what is it? Dr. Carol Nasser, formerly of the US Department of Defense, and colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, developed a comprehensive model for the body to sleep. Now a leading figure in the sleep sciences, Dr. Nasser is the founder and chairman of a company in California which specializes in sleep technologies. They have recently completed a pioneering investigation of human sleep. As we read this we are invited to tour a virtual sleep lab, a space devoted to our own personalized sleep journey. The scientists have set up a number of tests to explore our night sleep patterns and our state during the process of falling asleep and waking up."," At the very least sleep deprivation can lead to decreased alertness, increased anxiety, and stress. However, sleep is not all bad. Although sleep deprivation can cause fatigue, excessive sleep also leads to obesity, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases. Sleep has a variety of functions. It allows you to rest and repair, and is responsible for the body's temperature regulation. As well as this, sleep is an extremely important mechanism in the immune system to maintain homeostasis. Sleep is also critical in learning and information processing. Our bodies function more efficiently at night time, and a lack of sleep can result in a loss of performance."," But what exactly is chronic insomnia?  In this work, the author will argue that chronic insomnia is the inability to fall asleep at a specific time. Sleep problems include difficulty falling asleep, restlessness after waking up, difficulty keeping sleep, and sleep quality. They are frequently associated with chronic stress and depression, but often occur in people who are not suffering from chronic medical conditions, such as depression and Alzheimer's disease. The writer will go into the psychological and emotional background of insomnia, and how insomnia affects mental and physical health. They will analyze the role sleep plays in the functioning of the brain and will consider the effects of sleep on mood. They will examine the role of sleep in health and wellness and the effects it has on social and personal relationships.

By James Noyce PhD, writer and consultant A long-awaited report outlining how to get better sleep will be published by the Sleep Foundation in the next few days. But in the meantime, the way in which we view this problem is changing. In the United States, for example, there is now a clear consensus that sleep and health are inextricably linked. One can dream with less worry of going off to the toilet during the night. The American Sleep Association, the trade organisation for those who manage sleep, believes sleep has become as much a priority as eating or exercise. A lot of medical experts now believe that chronic insomnia can lead to chronic fatigue, which can become chronic illness. People who do not get enough sleep become less active, with lower levels of energy in the morning. The American Sleep Association estimated that about 400 million Americans are chronically sleep-deprived. As this number grows, so will the pressure on their medical care, the cost of medical tests and drug treatments, and the impact on the economy of the medical care provided. For many in the United States, the burden of getting enough sleep is a real medical issue, something to which they are increasingly turning attention. Some of those who complain about their sleep habits can actually be helped. In Britain, too, sleep is a key concern. There is a big challenge here, however. Our culture is largely a work culture. With more and more people at work than ever, many suffer from the so-called sleep fatigue. This is the tiredness which comes from a lack of sleep. More than..."," In the UK, the health service figures suggest that sleep deprivation and the associated illnesses like diabetes and heart disease are more common today than in the past. In many homes in the UK, it is a common experience for one of two people to suffer from sleep deprivation. In a household the person suffering from sleep deprivation is usually the parent. In the first place because parenting children in the UK is very demanding for both them and their partners and second, because children today grow up in environments very similar to their parents' environments. In the West, where education and the economic system are growing rapidly and children get less sleep than in the past, parents are often not taking the opportunities for sleep loss due to work or school. The present condition of insufficient sleep is therefore a public health problem and as such it should be addressed by the health service. In the second place, some experts claim sleep deprivation is a major cause of illness like the chronic conditions of diabetes and heart disease. The medical profession is becoming more and more interested in sleep deprivation as it has become clear that the amount of sleep taken affects health and behaviour. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published a clinical guideline for sleep disorders, known as the Bedtime Guidance, which can be used by general practitioners and hospital doctors when caring for patients with sleep disorders. The guidelines have four main suggestions for both parents and health professionals. First, the guidelines recommend a short bedtime in order to maintain healthy sleep patterns. At bedtime adults should get at least seven hours of sleep per night. The guidelines also recommend that sleep should take place in the same time each night. To ensure a long and successful sleep, parents should set a clear schedule for..."," But while sleeplessness can often be caused by sleep deprivation the author of 'Enough Sleep?' uses psychological manipulation instead. The novel is set in the UK in the year 2020 and introduces us to the first generation of 'stress baddies', meaning stress-stressed, anxious and over-critical people who have undergone psychological manipulation during their childhood or in their previous lives. This psychological manipulation involves forcing the people into believing that they cannot relax, and when they cannot relax, they suffer from chronic sleep deprivation. 'The psychological manipulation..."," Sleep is a major problem, but why and how. The world seems to run on sleep. How much sleep does it take for health? The first thing we should know about sleep is that sleep is short. It takes only a few hours a night, most people only get them. It is often referred to in the medical world as the 'blue-light phase'. Our bodies and mind require it, but it is very easy to miss it. In our busy lives, the brain has been trained to believe it is more important to think or to learn during the daytime than at night. So we let it slip through our mind. For this reason people often complain about being unable to get enough sleep at night and on their days off. It is a major problem that affects millions of people throughout the world who rely on it for their health. In the following passage, the text refers to research in the USA"

C2, But the bucket broke. You couldn't help but notice something odd about my situation. You shook your head slowly. The bucket had not been rigged in a way that made it easy to lower it into the well. You knew it was a good thing that the bucket was heavy enough to stay on the wall. Then you glanced up at me with a puzzled look. I looked back and you had been staring at me with eyes wide and then left the room., In the end I got to a point where I had to use a pair of power grips to keep the bucket in place. At this point I started to look down.," We got through the first few feet. Then, we stopped for a moment and it became apparent that the water could not be drained all the way up. After several seconds, I found that it had been blocked with sediment. The well was full of rocks. The first layer was small and inlaid like glass. As I struggled to drag the bucket up the well, I found that it was blocking the well again. The well's depth had apparently exceeded its capacity. At that point, I turned to you and asked: ""What should I do now?"" You: I can't help you unless you know what size well to drill for. Question: What does the well have to go bigger than the first."," We had hoped the waters would be warm enough to wash down our hardened hands. I pulled you into the well. At last it was time to go down, but before I could do so, you snapped back at me. You hugged me tightly from behind and made me feel good about myself again.  The following day you and I were seated in a park atop the hill overlooking the well.  The ground was damp and we sat on the grass as the sun was getting low. We were both in mourning; we were both sad, but we sat together. I told you about my scheme and how it seemed impossible until you assured me that all that was impossible in life is what we think it to be. We looked up at the stars and wondered what their secrets are. Finally we left the park on a high hill to walk on the hill. We walked up to a little cliff that separated the grassy area from the rocky area. The sun was slowly falling behind the cliff and the sky was darkening as I led you down to the water. We entered the deep pool that was the source of the well. The waters were very deep down, but the pool was warm enough and at a right angle to the well so I could push myself into the water. As I was about to fall, I heard you snapping and it started to look more and more like I was drowning.  All of a sudden you sprang up and my fear started to fade. I took your arm, which had been wrapped around mine, and pushed myself back up into the water. I swam back to the well and looked out of the well as I pushed myself out.  I turned around and found myself on the grass with your hand still wrapped around mine. You smiled down at me and said, ""You are not dead."" I nodded at you, smiling for the last time.", After a few taps to get it clear of the mud I swam into the well. I saw and felt a great hole and it swirled me round and round and swam around me. I saw a blue sky and the stars. I swam again and the hole swirled me round and round and swam around me. I was in a great green sea with the stars as the lights of cities in the distance. I felt and saw and heard things in my green sea.," WELL I had been reading something that looked like the Bible. He would stand there in the corner, eyes like the holes in his head. The author had tried to draw the reader's attention to this story. Sentences In this text, there are many short sentences."," I lifted the bucket to a height of a foot above the ground, which is a high enough depth for the well. I was looking at the stars. You were watching the ground as I did so and at once I realized that your eyes were focused on the well rather than the stars and you turned your head away and walked away. I turned my head and looked about and then decided that I would stand in the bucket so you could see the stars. I got closer. I reached into the bucket and saw the star. I was very excited but then I realized that it was not the star. It was a rock; but it was still a bright star."

C2," They were planning to learn Italian in particular to prepare for their trip to Venice for their holiday. While it was the perfect package for Keith, he had no knowledge of Italian. The other members of that particular package were all very well educated and had traveled extensively to various places in Italy. Keith needed something a bit less intensive and this holiday package was perfect.", The busiest day for those trips is the first of the month when everyone has a holiday in Italian. The trip for the group includes a visit to the Venetian gondolas and the palaces of the Grand Canal.," It turned out that there was another one in the same group from England. The package was cancelled on the spot, so Mr. and Mrs. Wrong Country Uncle had to give a big apology, but at least a new package will be organized for their youngest child.

This text is suitable for B2, C1 and C2 students", Keith's was the only one of them who didn't know the language. The other twelve knew it. Keith was very excited at the prospect of his first trip to Italy., The two young people paid an extra £75 for the extra place. They had heard that Italian was the language spoken in Venice and were delighted with the extra place. Keith and Dawne were looking forward to the holidays.," Keith and Dawne looked at one another, and Keith said: ""How many more words should I read to learn Italian?"" The counter clerk did not have a clue: her best guess would have been 12. Keith's reaction was not quite so surprising. He was a busy man. The counter clerk thought Keith was asking about how many more words a customer should read to learn Italian. In fact, she was answering a question about how many more words she should read for herself. The counter clerk was a person to be trusted. They know how many words a person must read in order to learn Italian. And they know the words that the people that use Italian must be familiar with. So how does a company decide how many words a customer should read if they don't know the answers to questions that are a critical component to their business? Keith's answer, ""How many more words do I read to learn Italian?"" was not surprising. To figure out whether they must teach that language to their customers, they must understand what their customers are asking them to do. They need to understand what it takes to learn Italian, so they know how many words a customer must learn to be successful at using Italian. And they know the words that the people that use Italian must be familiar with. Therefore, how do they choose which words to teach to their customers? To be able to teach Italian, your company must know how many words a customer has learned.", The holidaymakers were already paid and they were excited that it was going to be perfect. Keith and Dawne agreed to the package. They both paid and the money was sent. Keith and Dawne waited in their rooms for the hotel to call to check them out.

Keith and Dawne prepared to leave but the airport was closed. The airport staff told them the airport was closed and they went back to the hotel where they were staying.

C2," The next time a resident turns out the door or opens the front door, the rubbish collectors are there to collect the garbage. They are there to deliver it to the waste treatment plants which turn it into compost, wood or energy. All manner of material can be separated from the rubbish to produce new materials and materials which have no use. And that is what we are told this government has done. Government policies often include a strong dose of wishful thinking and environmental innuendo. When the government wants to ban smoking and says the smoke makes people sick, they pretend that they are only asking for a change of behaviour. They are not advocating for the total abolition of smoking which is the goal of all politicians. There is another way of putting it. If a politician or a group of politicians want to make a change in the public opinion, they have got to ask for money from the taxpayer. The public is more interested in whether or not this government is the cause of their health problems than it is in the policy it is pursuing. The environmentalists also like to be politicians. They often claim that they are trying to stop polluting the land and the environment, which is not true. They are only trying to save a few dollars out of the taxpayer's money, which is the taxpayer's money."," The main purpose of this is that rubbish can be weighed (at no cost to the consumer) and sorted for reuse. But the rubbish removal is not without cost to the environment. The rubbish itself is made from different kinds of trash taken from ordinary household waste, a great deal of which has no use after its useful life. To make matters worse, the rubbish goes unrecycled and is then disposed of into a landfill. To recycle a useful commodity like a piece of furniture, it is not so easy. Even if recycling a piece of furniture was easy, it would not save the environment. This would simply mean more scrap metal, greenhouse gases and the unnecessary use of more resources. In fact, there is a growing risk that the world’s resources will be exhausted much more rapidly than they are today. In his popular book, The Limits of Growth, Kevin Haldane argued that the economy will never be able to supply the levels of consumption that society demands. As the world population grows beyond current levels of 800 million, food production will never be enough to satisfy demand. The growth rate of population will outstrip that of available food supplies over the next 50 years. As Haldane argued, the way that the world produces food has become unsustainable, leading to food shortages in some regions. The result is the global food crisis that is sweeping the world today. However, we do not live in a world without limit, as Haldane suggests. Our problem with overconsumption is that we are making our world unsustainable in so many ways. We are polluting..."," The rubbish has been emptied and sorted into a series of sizes and shapes and separated from other household rubbish, which has been dumped into one of the many open bins. When a person produces more rubbish that is collected in one specific bin, he or she is charged for this.  In other words, rubbish is a scarce resource that is regulated in the way that oil is regulated in the Middle East. A family may decide that it has to go through with the collecting of rubbish every four years to save money, but the environmental costs associated with this are very high. People will not stop their rituals because it is a cheap thing to do, but because this is a low-profile aspect of their lives. There may be some drawbacks to recycling rubbish, and the costs of disposing of old things might outweigh the benefits."," The driver is usually paid to complete the job. An environmental activist believes that it should be made a lot more difficult for the private sector to collect rubbish, since it is so easy to clean the rubbish yourself. When rubbish is collected in the first place it should be given a specific and clear destination. In some parts of the world, it does seem environmentally sound to charge for rubbish produced. But for someone concerned about the environment, this might be a little too much. On the other hand, a recycling program may be a far too costly one and would take away from income. In the end, the more resources a society uses and pollutes, the more the society must pay to clean up the mess it leaves behind. To avoid this problem, people may have to think about two ways to collect rubbish: recycling and composting. Recycling is the process of turning waste materials into new materials. For example, a bag of rubbish can be made into new plastic and new paper by recycling the materials. Composting is the process of turning rubbish into soil to build up organic matter. Composting is generally used for lawn maintenance. To compost rubbish, all you have to do is throw it away when it begins to smell and put it in a bag and put it in a garden or compost pile."," The amount of rubbish collected depends on the size of the suburb or city and the number of residents' rubbish. Families in wealthy suburbs may have multiple lorries parked in their front yards, a waste carrier for the centralised pick-up of household waste and a further, separate collection site for recycling material. One of the problems with this approach is that rubbish is not necessarily deposited on the ground but on to a raised platform in front of the bin, leading to a much larger volume of household debris, rubbish or cardboard than intended. The resulting rubbish then ends up in the same way it started: on the roadside. What a waste of land. It is not, though, the only problem that comes with this system. People in such suburbs also tend to get fed up with having to wait for the collection vehicles, which take quite a long time to arrive at their destination. The collection vehicles could also run out of rubbish to carry or the lorries could break down at the roadside. The situation is compounded by a number of other problems: many household members refuse to use bins or to recycle; it is often too expensive to take rubbish to a recycling facility; and many areas simply have no facilities or enough to pick up waste (e.g. they contain many small gardens and allotments). An alternative solution to this situation is to introduce more personal responsibility. While many such services are available to residents in poorer areas, the rubbish problem remains the same. The aim is to introduce more personal responsibility to households in richer areas, and we will see how it could work. This might help to cut down on the amount of rubbish and the problem of food wasting. An added bonus is that it will create more..."," There is a price for rubbish bags: $0.50. But when the municipality decides which garbage collection vehicles to use, it does not consider the environmental impact of the vehicles. It only considers a number of factors that don't concern us (such as the number of cars used to transport rubbish), as well as the number of bags left to be collected. The rubbish is transported to a recycling plant, where the garbage is sorted into recyclables and thrown away, or burned to generate electricity. The recycling plants are run by the government, which only wants to produce more electricity. The government wants to produce more electricity because the taxes it collects are low - and its political ideology does not mention the importance of recycling, despite knowing that the electricity it generates is not recycled. The government will not allow you to become an electrician because you may question it on its ideology. When the government controls the economy and has no concerns about the environment, it also controls knowledge. The government controls the knowledge of how to make recycled paper. Children are not allowed to learn about the importance of recycling or how to make recycled paper, because they may question it. They are required to learn from parents what recycled paper is and what it should look like."," Most of it is reused by a small business, often run by a close relative or a member of the local community. But some goes back into a landfill and is left to rot in the sun. Most people in this country spend most of their time indoors, a fact that means that the recycling system can only deal with a fraction of what is thrown away."
C2, I could only stand here until the last minute. So I had to get over the ice-cream van. On my way to the starting block I saw a woman walk past me and head towards the racecourse. She looked exhausted. I wanted to help her but then I saw that she was on a dog. The woman took the dog's head and walked down the track. I was surprised but tried to cheer up her so she would stop and calm down. She was already quite upset when I arrived. I helped her to get over the ice cream van., I tried to think of why I wanted to watch the race. I was nervous! The excitement of watching the competition was strong within me. I had never seen a goat race before. I was curious! At first I was nervous but felt strong in my curiosity about my new hobby. I watched the animal in their enclosure being prepared. It looked like a very neat race. It was quite exciting to watch them race with their foals around a huge ring., I walked across a dirt road and finally got to the village's main street where a group of men with giant goats in the centre of the street were being raced. People were watching eagerly as they watched the big goats get tackled and tossed from the start area as the horses and riders raced towards the finish line. It was amazing. I was ecstatic.," My little brother, who was also in my party, joined me. As I struggled I decided to look at the number of people at the stalls. I looked at them closely and then gave it a quick glance. I saw the number of people were much lower than I expected. In fact, more than likely the stall was empty or there would be at least a couple of people. So I walked over to the racecourse and made my way over to the start. It did not take me long to get my bearings. My little brother soon made his way over. The racecourse was huge. There was a big field with stalls where people were putting on their gear, eating, drinking and having fun. The crowd was very diverse. There were women, men, children, old, young, all over the place. The atmosphere was very festive as people were hanging around in the stalls and there were many parties as everyone was having fun together. My little brother was there with me and there were so many people around it took a long time to get to our starting stall and set off on the race. As we arrived my brother jumped off his bicycle and began to ride around the field. It was a fun ride and we both had a fantastic time. Soon, we were on the racecourse. This was going to be a great race! When we entered the field, the smell of the animals coming off the stalls greeted us. The smell of the fresh goat carcasses were already present. We could smell the meat. The ground beneath the stalls was covered with goat’s feces and urine. I decided to sit down near the stalls. The smell was so strong there was no way of escaping it. I decided not to get on my bike. Instead I sat on the ground.

Something more interesting, more entertaining. Goats. I was at a show. Goats. I was in a show. In short, goats and I had something to bond together, in some way. In all honesty, I wasn’t sure how. I had been up to no good lately, so it must be that."," The goats were fast and they had no idea of where they were going so they ran a straight course with little to no change in speed. Some of the goats ran on their tails and some ran on their sides but they all were the same in this race. Most of the goats raced a good distance. The race was sponsored by the village and ran by the village committee and they paid the goats. Some goats were paid more for their good run while others were not. Goats are very common in rural areas in the region. The kids all agreed that the race was exciting to watch. The race was very long and the kids enjoyed the excitement of watching the goats race. Some were jumping up and down and others were standing by while they heard the crowd chanting the goats' name. The kids had fun running back and forth through the crowd to cheer the goats. I told the kids to watch the goats in a relaxed way that is still exciting. A few of the goats ran very fast but they were not the best goats, I thought. I made a remark that the goats should run faster and shorter distances. I told them to practice running up and down the track while they ran towards the race. I felt that as the race grew closer, they should race less distance to avoid getting tired and losing their form. The kids were in awe of the goats and they were cheering the goats. The goats were running in three groups, five goats total. Two of the goats came..."," I was surprised to notice a kid who was on his own, looking back at his parents and apparently annoyed. He didn’t seem to care. His parents were not being distracted and didn’t appear to have been paying any attention to him. The kid was annoyed and he was annoyed enough that he kept mumbling, and mumbling until his parents realized something wasn’t right and moved. A couple of kids were about to race the goats, with one boy carrying a red basket. In the meantime a child with brown hair grabbed the goat and rushed past them. Everyone else in the crowd tried to keep up with the kid with brown hair. The kid with brown hair, grabbed the goats and raced them. He was in top gear. The kids with brown hair, though, were out of time. The kid with brown hair, sprinted home. As he came home he made the kids with brown hair cry. He didn’t even care. The kid with brown hair had a go at everything. He ran, jumped, and swayed to the beat. He raced all over the place. As he raced he shouted at the kids with brown hair to slow down. There was a moment of silence, then a scream, then the goats started running. The kid with brown hair was too fast for the goats. As the kid with brown hair pulled away, everyone screamed. Then the kid with brown hair came back to race the goats. He grabbed the red basket and started to race away again. The kids with brown hair looked at the goats and tried to catch up but the kid with brown hair was too fast. He ran, jumped and swayed to the beat.

C2," Susan watched helplessly as one of her children put out her last remaining bed and one of her youngest children got out and went back to her husband in the other room. Susan was shocked and terrified but didn’t want to talk about the removal day. “It’s a bad time,” Susan said. Susan is now thinking about the people who took the house away from her and she wonders if there is anything to give in return. She thought about the thousands of people who live without a home and wonders what it would be like to live in a homeless shelter. But Susan doesn’t think the homeless shelter would be for her because she would be an old woman then. The homeless shelter wouldn’t accept her.

So what is it exactly about Susan which keeps her stuck in the past?," Susan was upset to hear the news, but she had no choice. She had never known her home to be anything other than a peaceful place, and she felt that her husband had always been kind, caring and full of love to her and her children. She was not sure what to do with the home. As the removal day approaches she was sure that she must do something before the van left. So she put the house in order. She tried to make the home even nicer. She made everything ready for the van to leave. The first thing she tried to do was clean the yard with the help of her children. Then she had to clean the kitchen, and set everything neatly out.", Now all that is left is the kitchen in which the house once stood with all the essentials of a well equipped kitchen now gone as well as the garden.

C2, ‘They have scales’ he said. What is the relationship between scales and dinosaurs? His answer was obvious. I didn’t ask him what other things he knew about dinosaurs. What was so funny?," ‘Oh yes, I saw them in a TV show’ he replied. ‘Well then what kind of dinosaur was it?’ I asked. ‘A flying one’ he added. I was so impressed he had memorized the entire programme and all it showed me was a flying dinosaur. His behaviour has obviously developed in a very short amount of time. In fact it seems he may be a little dinosaur."," ‘Dinosaurs used to be big’ said he, ‘They used to have feathers and fly’. But when I looked a little closer he was saying ‘Dinosaurs’ and then ‘dino’ in his mouth. He then went back to his antics. So I asked him what it was he wanted to be for dinner and he said ‘Dino for dinner’."," His answer was ‘We eat noodles for dinner’. I had him explain why he knew that dinosaurs ate noodles. ‘My father used to say I was an old dinosaur,’ he was startled and apologetic. ‘I thought about dinosaur eating noodles but my brother laughed at me so I stopped. ‘But my father used to say the dinosaurs were not real,’ he continued with relief. ‘I didn’t really understand what he was talking about. He used to say dinosaurs did not exist but I thought them a bunch of fancy toys. It was all play.’ ‘You can see all the things they did,’ I told him, ‘They could fly, swim and walk with feathers.’ ‘But they could not climb trees,’ he said. ‘My mum tells me that if you were a dinosaur you could climb like a tree and no one would be able to catch you.’ ‘But when you were old enough to walk you could walk very slowly.’ ‘Then there were dinosaurs that were small and very fast but not very durable.’ ‘And then there was one dinosaur that was the longest,’ I quoted the boy’s description in passing. ‘This dinosaur was really fast but it was also very brittle and could not defend itself.’ The boy looked up with a laugh and said ‘I like dinosaurs. I think they are funny because they can walk funny and they are long.‘ I wondered how this kid knew what dinosaurs ate and why. They were certainly not very clever creatures. After speaking and listening to him I realized that we were living in an age where children can view a TV show from the convenience of their living room. And yet they can still be taught to play dinosaurs. We are used to the media making dinosaurs, reptiles and other creatures appear to have the characteristics children..."," ‘Yes we have one’ said he, looking towards the television where we were sitting. A quick search on the internet revealed that ‘dinosaur’ is an Australian name for a chicken. After all it is the only one known to come from a bird. So a chicken is a dinosaur."," He could tell me quite a bit. We watched the show together then he started to pull the noodles out of his mouth. He said he had a ‘dinosaur dinner’. The next morning we started to talk about it. His reaction was: 'I am not a dinosaur, I am a man!' I pointed out that dinosaurs didn't actually eat meat so he didn't fit the picture. ‘But I was pretending to be a dinosaur,’ he said. The last sentence brought back a memory he could not let go of. ‘Did the boy mean the meal he had was wrong?’ I asked. He was still laughing. I suggested to take it down for Flesch-Kincaid Grade so that his teacher could take note. He was furious! ‘But it's not a big deal,’ he said. I was shocked. The boy had been reading the story to me and it was clear to me that this is not a healthy way to build vocabulary.", He remembered that they only have feathers (and no tails). He also said ‘I saw them in the book’. The dinosaur looked a bit like this (picture).

C2," Soon, however, they noticed the same stranger hanging around in their own group of monkeys and were frightened to death. What did the stranger do?"," What made the leader of the group act so foolishly is that he felt confident that, once he joined the group, he would have a chance to take over."," Vervet monkeys are territorial animals, so the stranger was a potential menace. The male was attacked by the group then left for good, with the other male in the group deciding it was time for a change. Vervet monkeys are an example of an animal's behaviour and patterns and they need more information to learn how to behave appropriately in social settings.  You can use the following materials from your textbook if you are using this as a reading assignment:  Figure 2. Vervet monkeys."," The dominant male reacted as though he were the group leader in that it didn’t allow the stranger to join the group. But his own status as the group leader was not up for debate: he stood his ground and made eye contact with the stranger, then, his guard up, went off and ate something to distract himself. When the stranger, the dominant male, had had his fill, he stood up from the trees and tried to follow the monkeys. The newcomer did not like that move and immediately walked away. Cheney: the monkey's leader The stranger: the newcomer"," The group did a little dance to the newcomer’s music before he could join them, but they did not want to admit that their new member was different from them. All members were in the groove, playing their own tunes and making the most of life."," He was looking for a place to live. But there was no place for him to live in the grove of trees. This is what he would have had to do, if he’d stayed in the tree grove: he would have to dig a hole out in the dirt so that he could stand on his tiptoes in the hole, get some dirt underneath his feet, so that he could climb down onto a branch and pull himself out.

C2," For another, and perhaps more importantly, they are inherently related to the social reality of art. By social reality is meant the social conditions, laws, habits, customs, etc., that existed at the time the artistic work was made. This is the background of how we know they existed.

One can answer that these artworks are things that exist because they are made by people. People themselves have made these artworks.

How it happens is an attribute of the art itself."," This means that a proper measurement of their ability to convey a certain meaning is not possible.



WATCH WATCH AESTHETICS By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically.

C2," If you are an art critic whose work is published in the newspaper, the newspaper is criticising you. A journalist is criticising you. A musician is criticising you. One of the ways to change the current state of affairs is to create a new type of career based on the principles of the 21st century."," What is the solution? To improve the image of professions by developing a strong, positive and consistent vision of what professionals do and should be. For example, when you graduate in a science or technology field, what do you really want? You know what you want, you want the highest possible reputation and to be recognized for your work? Is this what your profession should be. Or do you want to make your profession successful but not in a personal way and want to help other people, to have a positive impact on society? You have heard it said that every profession has a strong and negative image of itself. The negative image is often built on the shoulders of the profession's most successful or prestigious members. In reality, the majority of scientists or technicians do not work as hard as they should and there are also many who should but are not able to work as often as they should. It is true that there are some people who work hard and are successful but it is far too early for these to be the majority. What is needed are people who have the courage to change the image of each profession. There will be no progress without honest reflection on the profession's image. In the future, your image will not only reflect your professional competence, but it will also reflect your professional contribution to the good of your profession, to the good of society and to the good of yourself."," The problem is that it is often an illusion. We live in a time when our lives have become interconnected with others'. Our life is a series of links. The question is, where do you want to be at the end of your life?

C2," You might even come to expect it. We will almost never have to think about it. You have already said it. Language is a beautiful thing. In fact, you might be saying something that is true. We are such a complicated creature..."," Life is lived, language is practiced. They both belong to a species with a remarkable ability. What is this species called? We and you belong to the same species.", Words change a state of being and can alter even the very existence of a person. I cannot believe a word could alter the state of your life. You may believe but I don't., Most modern languages have been built up from a few basic building blocks. Some languages are built from a few simple words; others from a few simple sounds. Some languages are built from a few basic grammar rules that govern the arrangement of elements such as words and sounds into phrases.," The language we use is like a fingerprint for who we are. But there are many languages and how they have evolved is not always predictable. In the present case the group we observe is of two species. One of them has a language similar to ours, but the other has lost the ability to communicate. You are to investigate the differences and similarities between the two languages. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about this situation? The languages differ."," This, combined with the fact that language has a strong influence upon how we interpret the world around us, means that it is often difficult for people to write a single sentence without knowing a word from someone they have spoken to before. This scale is based on a system of levels of linguistic competence used worldwide to grade the written language of students from elementary to graduate degrees. It is an indication of how easy a language is to read for a given age. Each number represents a level of competence. For this level, a language has the following linguistic features:"," The communication that takes place between people often goes beyond their local boundaries to the point that it is impossible to imagine life without language. The language you and I belong to is called ""Latin"" but the people around us would probably call it ""Common."" Most people have a penchant for English. In fact, it seems that most people are even more likely to have a penchant for English. In some ways speaking English is even easier than speaking Latin, although some of us prefer to speak Latin rather than English. As you can imagine, Latin has a great many different pronunciations in different dialects. In fact, some people find it difficult to pronounce Latin as they speak it. They would prefer to be able to pronounce Latin as they actually speak it. They are called Lingualists.

Familiarise yourself with the basic concepts of narrative in a language, and the components of a narrative."
C2," What’s more, the exhibition includes something the public and museum curators may not be ready for. It is inspired by a famous kinetic performance art exhibition which, between 1939 and 1943, featured four great 20th century American artists — Gertrude Stein, Georgia O’Keeffe, Roy Lichtenstein and Max Ernst — in the gallery’s basement. In the early 1980s, a team of artists and curators began to search for inspiration and took inspiration from a show called Strange Incident in the Gallery. Gertrude Stein was a regular visitor to the gallery between 1923 and 1929. As a young artist, she was particularly interested in the way that space can be used in her work. She was fascinated with both the movement of space itself and the concept that the movements of people can create such beautiful things. It is from this interest that the exhibition includes kinetic pieces of art from Gertrude Stein, and works of art that were also made by Max Ernst, Georgia O’Keeffe and Roy Lichtenstein. But the show’s most intriguing element is the exhibition’s title itself. Strange Incident in the Gallery’s basement is an interesting title, but it also makes reference to the title of a kinetic art show in 1938 that featured the four American artists in the gallery. The title Strange Incident in the Gallery’s basement refers to the fact that, in 1939, when the four American artists started their exhibition in the basement, there were no other artists exhibiting in the gallery at that time. It makes it impossible for the public to find out what is going on. What was happening? The answer lies in the title of the kinetic art exhibition Strange Incident. The exhibition, which started in the basement on May 25, 1939, featured some of the most beautiful works of kinetic art in the world. It was an opportunity for the public to view the work of the four American artists but the curators and artists made it such that there was only one artist exhibiting. In addition, they tried to hide their identity from the public to prevent people from identifying which artist was exhibiting. For example, a kinetic installation called A..."," The exhibition is called ‘The Velvet Underground and the Gently Moving People: Kinetic Art from 1925 to the Present’ at the Hayward Gallery between 22nd April and 4 June, 2006. The Velvet Underground was a creative collective in the United Kingdom that existed for just over five years in the mid-1960s. The group created avant-garde art in a more informal way than much of the later generation of artists."," The exhibition is titled, Kinetic Art Rejoice. In a world increasingly concerned with physical beauty and the pursuit of ‘flaunting’ and the ‘beautification’ of the world, what is the attraction of the art? The answer is movement. In the 1920s, kinetic art developed into something of a movement. But in the 1950s, the public reaction to the movement in Britain was almost negative. And, not surprisingly for a movement formed by an experiment and an experimentation, its existence was more or less obscured, or, if not entirely obliterated, it was generally taken for granted. The exhibition traces the history of kinetic art — that is art which is concerned with movement — in the twentieth century. The exhibition is titled, Kinetic Art Rejoice. In a world increasingly concerned with physical beauty and the pursuit of ‘flaunting’ and the ‘beautification’ of the world, what is the attraction of the art? The answer is movement."," In fact this new exhibition is a celebration of kinetic art in Britain, of its very first movement. It is the history of two artists who were integral to it at the very start — Gilbert Scott and Dorothy Hodgkin. Gilbert Scott Gilbert Scott is famous because he was the creator of the famous Sculpture for the National Socialist Party which is displayed in London’s Parliament House. He started out as a sculptor and painter, but after a career in commercial real estate became an artist who was very interested in making kinetic art. In the 1920s he collaborated with the British artist Dorothy Hodgkin, a leading figure in kinetic art. Dorothy Hodgkin Dorothy Hodgkin is another well-known character in the history of kinetic art in Britain, who was the director of the Hayward Gallery for many years. She was one of the most important people in the kinetic art scene in the 1920s. Hodgkin began making works of kinetic art in the 1920s. In particular, she made works which were called “rhythm machines”. In the 1930s Hodgkin developed her own way of making art which became known as “kinetics”, which means “kinetic motion”. Hodgkin, as well as her other collaborator, Gilbert Scott, were very instrumental in the early stages of kinetic art in Britain. In this exhibition the two artists are treated in their full-blooded individuality. They are not merely compared to each other, nor are they presented in a chronological order. They are also treated as interconnected artists. In this exhibition they are clearly identified as the creators of the kinetic art movement in Britain. Both artists share a deep admiration for motion as a means of expression."," If you have not already done so, find out more on the History Channel website, visit the Hayward Gallery or watch a clip from the History Channel on their Channel 4 website."," Total sentences: 300 sentences

The exhibition is based on the work of the British artist Maryline S. Baker, who was born in 1943 and died in 1980. In her later years she lived and worked in Germany. The exhibition focuses on Baker’s work, which includes a number of sculptural objects, drawings, video and photography, and on her ideas on kinetic art, as well as the ways in which she translated such ideas into her work and her personal life.  In this way, Baker was an important exponent of kinetic art, who incorporated her beliefs into her art. The exhibition is organised into four main sections. The central section focuses on the idea of kinetic art. We will see drawings and video in the middle section. It includes three short films made by Baker which explore what a movement is. The second section focuses on Baker’s own work, which includes photographs of the works of others. The last section focuses on her experiences as an artist and the way in which she translated her ideas into her art. In the opening scene, we see Baker and an artist (probably in her late teens) sitting in her atelier. Baker is making some drawings. After a short time, she finishes a sketch. She looks down at the paper with a blank expression. Baker then takes a sketchbook to her closet to begin her project. We are introduced to an empty wall in the background. Baker then pulls out a drawing. In the next scene, we see Baker and her lover. They sit on a sofa together and their backs are towards the wall. Baker pulls..."

C2," For me, in my life this was the case but as it is so obvious that these poems are not only to me but to the wider audience the recitations should of course be public."," ~ William of Oldmaxe, 12th Century Poetry recitals are often held at universities as part of the celebrations. In this instance, the celebrations were held at University of Nottingham on Monday and Tuesday, the 22nd and 23rd of May. 

This month of May is a month in the year that was marked by one of the major events in the early history of Europe. It marks the foundation of the University of Paris and it also marks the founding of the University of Paris, which was named after a French poet, the poet of the University of Paris. In the words of Victor Hugo, 'University of Paris means University of Poets'. This is an important month in the history of the UK."," Many of us are fortunate enough to live through what is known as the Golden Age of Poetry. In the late medieval period the writer known as Virgil was a member of the ruling house of Aquilonia, a family that founded Rome's first state. Virgil was a prominent orator, a senator, and a poet.", Read this passage to understand what is meant by posthumous fame. Postmortem is an adjective for those who are still remembered after death.," In the same way we might expect that some of the people who have appeared in poetry recitals in the past will show up again in the future, with some new faces. As poetry recitals can often seem strange to outsiders, they tend to attract the very best of the classics and the renowned performers. Some of their performances are quite amazing to the ears.  We have chosen to present some of the best recitals of poetry that have appeared in the past and we have categorized them in a way to be easy to understand, especially for a beginning reader. List the main features of each poem. This is an introduction to a list of poems:"," By this I mean that poets, such as Dante and Milton, are the most famous poets while other poets are lesser known and ignored even today, and their works and ideas are remembered today for something else entirely. In history, Dante is less of a poet than Milton is, but today Milton is known for his literary works while Dante is forgotten. Milton's ideas are remembered today for something else entirely.

C2," However, there is little agreement on whether they function directly in bonding. Why do we cry? For some, they argue, tears act as a form of therapy. It is the cry that connects the heart and soul. It is the cry that conveys a deep feeling, such as pity or joy. For others, tears serve an adaptive function. This is what the evolutionary psychologist John Bowlby understood. He found the emotional role of crying in children. This is the reason why we so often cry when we are in pain. Our tears help release hormones, that fight off the pain, thus allowing us to cope. How do we learn to cry for fear? Are we born with it or can we learn to cry in fear? Crying during childbirth may provide a psychological advantage in enabling a person to better cope with pain and death. When the child was born, crying during delivery helps parents to feel a connection with their baby. As a result, they may release hormones that fight off the pain, thus allowing parents to cope.", Charles Darwin and scientists are now studying the emotional role of tears in humans.

When a child is crying, the adult is usually in tears as well."," Many tears are used to cry out a problem, but others may be used to heal. In a family, a child is often born in tears."," The emotional need that has been known to be best transmitted via the tears is that of loss. Words cannot express the emotion of feeling helpless.

C2," That’s why you should stick to personal photos for online check-ins, and choose not to make them public. On the bright side: people often don’t find out that you’re just sharing your photos with the world. So, you’re less likely to be embarrassed. Public check-ins: One such well-known example of this phenomenon is the famous photograph of the two comedian Bob and Clint Eastwood hanging out in London before the filming of the movie. That was all very public, except for the fact that it was taken from the back of Clint’s Volvo V70. One might be tempted to share this photo with everyone online – since it clearly shows the two iconic performers together. But this isn’t right. If the Eastwoods were planning on being friends when their car was parked in public, who knows what kind of friends they’d have if it weren’t for this particular photo? Sticking to personal photos for online check-ins might just be the only way to avoid the public check-ins dilemma."," People on Twitter are not exactly used to seeing the big blue button on their timelines that lets them post about a wide variety of things. There is no button similar to yours. To add to the problem, Twitter is not exactly used to expressing thoughts – a lot of people use it simply for posting shortened texts. Yet, just in the last few months, there has been a major influx of blogs that are being used to confess things such as the following: The writer of these posts is posting her thoughts and experiences on Twitter, rather than blogging or expressing the same thoughts through a traditional blog. This change in how people express themselves – and the way they express themselves using social networking sites – is called a blog culture, but a blog culture can also be called social blogging. What will happen with these blogs in the future?", Nowadays it takes quite a bit of courage to write and blog the truth about you - so I decided to hide it and have only a few posts written before I gave it out.," The writer of the website was right, but we are going to go with his opinion: Blogging: Confessing to the world The online world was once a place where we were hiding under our desks. Not anymore. It is open, public, and you are your only audience – for the life of your blog."," A new way of learning is to start writing on blogs: confessing to the world! As always, this may look like a piece of journalism. The first paragraph should start with a strong claim, a hook and an informative paragraph. If you are writing a piece for a newspaper you might consider using a title and an opening sentence that attracts the readers to your work. The body of your piece should give the main information of your piece. Use a simple form of grammar. The closing paragraph should be persuasive."," Online communication also has the advantage of being more forgiving. If you write a blog post about your adventures, you can edit it at any time, make it more concise and change the language."," It is that risk that is highlighted in blogging. Blogging is a great way to expose yourself to new people, but it is important to stay positive, keep up the good work and always be confident in yourself. When you feel down, you should always remember that there is a whole world to explore and blogging is just one step in that journey! Your post   was about   the risks of public check-ins.

C2, It is the very basis of our relationship with food I mean. There is no comparison to watching a meal develop and feel the taste of the dish or the smells or the light touch or the tinkle of the silverware against our dishes. So today when I see food that we love I take pride in its existence.," True. In fact people with little or no cooking skills are able to find satisfaction in simple and everyday foods in many ways. We find out this when we eat our way through a large tray of food from a cafe or restaurant, we pick up a single small dish from a street vendor or when we do not even notice what we are eating and just let it be. And sometimes we take great satisfaction in small things or even in a plain food. The relationship to food is elemental and satisfying, like the relationship to water. It's also elemental and satisfying. Our relationship with water, for instance, is also elemental and satisfying. What makes a good relationship with water? Is a simple relationship that is elemental and satisfying? Is a relationship that makes you feel good and clean? Or is it a relationship that is less elemental and satisfying? Does it require an excessive amount of resources like water? Is the water you drink clean? Is it available to all? Or is it not in accessible to some? Is it a relationship that needs constant surveillance like water? Is it a relationship with something you do not know? Is it like a relationship you have with your parent or spouse? Is it a relationship with a drink you always had? Is it a relationship with water you can enjoy at any time? Is it a relationship you have with a water fountain on a city street?

One of the things that made me so determined to write this article was that I wanted to say something about the pleasure of enjoying a simple, healthy meal. The things I learned from my cookery books and by tasting and trying a few foods helped me realize how much good, real food can do, and even how much more enjoyable food can be."," But cooking food is about making something beautiful, it's about using your hands to create something new and exciting, to feed the body and to be generous to the soul.", The thing is food is just that food and we just need to let it be... or at least try! In the afternoon we had our favourite coffee and cookies.," It is one of those things where what’s really important is how much you enjoy it and its flavour and texture. Food We are constantly amazed and delighted by the wonder of food. No doubt the fact that people have turned to cooking and baking for a way of enjoying life is because we have come to value the pleasures of cooking. There is nothing like food to fill our hearts.

C2, Yet the Lure of the Kitchen is a strange and wonderful place. Chefs in the same place do all kinds of interesting things. And it is a good thing too. If you are a woman looking for something to do - and if you happen to be young enough - then it could well be.," At a time when most of us were looking for jobs that would provide us with some semblance of a decent retirement our dream career choice seemed to fit very little in with what a lot of people actually wanted. But life was to make the choice not I. My decision was driven by a simple principle; I wanted to make the world a better place. And that is something you can only do when you have a full-time job that provides you with real satisfaction. So I took the plunge and became a chef in order to provide some needed stability and a better income. Now I know all too well how that worked out. Most people will never even give a thought to the kind of life that chefs lead. They will not even bother to think about the fact that the food that they eat may not even be safe. Instead they spend their days watching TV, eating and sleeping. But that is not the view of the true professional. Because the chef is a man with a passion for food, the love of a good meal. A chef wants to make the world a better place and the people of the world a better food for all. So the job must be worth doing. As anyone who is a part of the industry can tell you cooking is much more than the dish at the end of a long line. But in many ways we cook because we simply love cooking. There is no more satisfying thing in the world than taking the time to spend your days cooking and enjoying the food. When you cook and when you eat you will be creating a real change in the world. And that is something that is worth the pain. The Lure of the Kitchen is a story about a chef who decided it was time to make the world a better place by becoming a chef."," They would have to put in long hours in the kitchen. Many women would have to stay in bed to nurse. And yet that was the dream. I decided that my dreams would come true in the kitchen. I left the university and began training at the best French and European Culinary Arts Institute, to become a fully qualified chef. I have often wondered what it is like to be a chef. I was hoping to have a go."," And yet, it was what I dreamed of. So the first weekend after I graduated I went into a supermarket. I bought a pack of flour. Then I bought a spoon, some butter, and three eggs. I turned on the kitchen on the supermarket and I prepared some simple dishes. I was very proud of them. They turned out perfectly. I told the owner of the supermarket that I wanted to be a chef. He said to me, ""If this kitchen was going to serve you what you're going to need then the other restaurants in the supermarket would probably be better off."" ""But not just any restaurant,"" I said. ""I would like to open a restaurant by myself."" The owner agreed.", There are however aspects to this profession that make you want to love it. The rewards for being a chef are worth it in that you are among the few in the world that have the power of choice of what you serve your guests.," But there is a glimmer of light in the darkness of a chef's life as I found out on the first day at work when I was introduced to the cooks. A young woman named Anne-Marie started work as a cook. We met the chef one evening when he went for a drink. I thought it must be the chef that had invited me - after all we were sitting at the same table. Anne-Marie looked very nervous, and at first I wondered whether I was to be treated as a companion. It wasn't until the next night that I discovered that she was the chef's fiancee. I was not prepared for this and decided to put the question to the chef at a later date - at that point I didn't have time to ask her out. The chef's fiancee looked downcast; she explained that she had lost her fiancé. Her story had touched me deeply. That night as the others finished their work she asked if I would like to help her. I was flattered, but said no. I explained that I was looking for a fiancee - something very unusual at the time in a chef's life. She didn't say a word - but at dinner that evening we were served a very fine meal. She told me that Anne-Marie had just been married and that she had gone to live with her mother in the kitchen to help out.", But I was determined to succeed and wanted to try my hand at the profession. I ended up making it as a chef. But I wanted to be a writer and writer's life was more enjoyable than that of a chef. My writing career prospered and I became a successful and famous writer. In my earlier work I learned some basic sentence patterns. In the following text some patterns are examined in order to find out how easy the passage is to follow.

As I came closer to him, he looked slightly flushed. I told him that I needed some company so he invited me in. I sat and waited while he sat behind the desk and sketched some designs. I was surprised to find out that the young man was a talented artist. Although it was only his second art class, I could see that he already had a certain amount of control over his work and his ideas. He was also quite intelligent and articulate. His life seemed to have a sort of purpose. His parents had put up money to help him get into art school and I think I also felt a certain pride at seeing him in his lofty position in life. The boy seemed quite friendly, and I liked his smile. He had a unique way of saying things that made me laugh out loud. He had a voice that was so deep and strong that the walls of his apartment would shake if he was speaking. I wanted to be close to him so I asked if I could stay for another class. He told me that he was very busy at the moment and would be glad to talk to me in the future. While he was talking, I found myself laughing and giggling out loud. As we got to know each other, I began to feel a sort of affinity for him. I could tell he enjoyed talking and hearing me laugh. He told me that art was a form of therapy for him. He also said that he had worked on his art since he was 12 years old. It was the only thing that had kept him from becoming a criminal. I asked him if his parents had told him about art. He answered that the subject was never talked about. In his opinion, all kids learn to make art because it is an excellent way of building confidence and feeling good. He also said that he had learned the value of his own art from his mother. I smiled when I heard this and said that I had heard that art is therapeutic, but never thought of it in that...", His family is wealthy. There was a rich butler and numerous servants.

His home, the first of his children’s houses, was in a pretty disreputable part of town. We were given the slip as soon as Tim’s wife entered the room. She wore her hair braided into a tight scrunch and her large, full-rimmed glasses made her look as if she might be a judge of the world. She greeted us with her usual friendly smile, winking at us occasionally but otherwise making us feel like a big nuisance. The other room was a large family room, with Tim’s wife sitting next to a man at another end of the room. They sat with their feet propped against the wall, their legs apart and their feet up and their knees out in front of them. I wondered what this family were about, because everything around them looked so disorganised. I was sure that there was something wrong with them. Tim was the person who we were invited into their home. It did not seem to make him feel at ease, either. My friend went to Tim’s next door neighbour to ask what was going on, so that if Tim were really upset about the situation then she could talk to him. But the neighbours said nothing about their neighbours being in trouble. One day a lady arrived at Tim’s door with a small child, and she looked like someone who might be in trouble. She sat down with her baby, and looked around timidly. As soon as the lady moved to sit down by the baby, Tim turned to her and his wife and said, “Where are your daughter?” The lady started crying. She said, “She ran away. I was looking for her, but there was nobody there. I looked everywhere, but then, I found her on the steps.” “Oh, she was gone,” Tim said. “Let me take her home,” I thought. “Oh! No,” said Tim, “I don’t want to take your child. Please just let me have it, because it’s very dangerous to take her home and I really need her to be safe now.” “I know. But the police are there, they wouldn’t let you take her in.” “Oh no! I didn’t know that, but the police are here and the police...", A young man seated in an armchair had just gotten into the room. He was the only occupant and wore an evening coat and a blazer.

The next morning he told me that it was my fifth time visiting him, and I told him, “it was probably my favorite time!” The smile lit up his face as he replied, “I can only tell you that there’s very little I haven’t been here before.” He had an aura of knowledge, and the more time spent with him, the more I began to believe it. His eyes were like a mirror, reflecting the world around them. His eyes were like a mirror, reflecting the world around them. In my study days it was common to find people in my class and write notes on the margins, and Tim had a method that left me wanting to write notes all the time. Tim made it easy to write notes, and it seemed that every sentence he read was perfect."
C2," Advertising had to be particularly hard hit. Advertising was not the industry where things got better. Advertising agencies had to spend huge amounts of money to keep staff on the job and to keep up with client work. Advertising was often the sector with the most workers in the deepest recession. It was more than half of the workers who were looking for work for the first time in the recession. Advertising was in fact tough for a number of reasons: Income was often stagnant and jobs were few but lucrative and stable. As well, there was a big shift in market place where print media had moved on to digital media where new, better paid, more demanding jobs were available. Advertising has always been hard, but you have to be a hard worker to survive in tough times. Advertising on trial If you work for an advertising agency The early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough.

Advertising agencies had to spend huge amounts of money to keep staff on the job and to keep up with client work. Advertising was often the sector with the most workers in the deepest recession."," So your company had to start laying off thousands of staff in order to survive. Many jobs were lost. Not just the workers who were losing their jobs, many families could expect to lose their homes as well. A family home is something that can be very precious, particularly if your family is quite small. It means you and your family can keep together - even if some of the income from your business was coming in as a result of selling land. The land in your area may be being sold at very low prices and you may even get to keep the property in exchange for your part of the business. That is a good thing because if you start selling it, you may be able to keep it in the family name. All this may sound good news, but it actually spells hardship for many families. A lot of people lose their homes and thousands of jobs. And you are not going to want your home to be just a reminder of your troubles for your grandchildren. It is time for them to start contributing. You could help your family out by building a home to sell on the property of your business. Your parents will then have something to show off to their grandchildren."," I was working for my first employer as an advertising agency. I was told it would be good for business, but it certainly wasn't what I expected when we agreed on our work contract. You wanted to work at a good advertising agency. What you were handed instead was a miserable work-life and the most awful of company culture at all time. The only problem was that for all our efforts to reach the most demanding of clients we still struggled to make any money at all."," Now, 30 years later, there are signs of recovery, with a rebound in business. Some sectors of business have shown signs of recovery, while others are still suffering from the recession. Ad agencies are no exception to this. Businesses have been able to return to the levels of activity they had before the recession, with one exception: Trial advertising. Trial advertising can be described as being paid to try a product in preparation for a sale. A product or service that has not yet been ready for the general public will normally be tested as a marketing tool to see whether it can generate interest in the future. However, during a recession, trial advertising can become a problem. People will not be able to afford to try a product or service, so the advert may not be seen as a proper marketing tool. Consequently, you will not be able to earn profits from the product or service on sale. An example of trial advertising could be the ads on TV, or the brochures or flyers you would find in the local shop. The recession and recession will be worse off those who depend on the trial advertising sector for their livelihood."," However, this would have been unbearable for most employers.

C2," How to Write Poetry is an ode to the art of not being too predictable or predictable at all, but still coming out right -- sometimes. To find out just how to do it, David R. Grier, a poet in the first class and a teacher of first class, has compiled a helpful cheat sheet to get you going."," The first step is to make some money writing, and that's where poems come in handy -- you might get a job, and by that time, you don't have to be worried. But to actually be a poet one must learn how to write poems. Poetry comes in many styles and can be practiced for years to come. Here are some common style of poetry: (in no particular order):   Naturalistic Poetry: This style consists of writing in response to a subject or a situation. You might be inspired by a specific experience (a birthday, a vacation, a good or bad dream) or maybe it's something you come across in nature. Try composing a poem based on that experience.  Reflective Poetry: You write a poem based on your feelings about a particular event or subject. For instance, you might write about how you feel when you learn a new sentence from a poem. You might also write about things you feel or see. For instance, try writing about a conversation you have with someone. If you're not sure how to write about a conversation you had with a friend, try writing about a conversation you had with another friend. Reflective Poetry is similar to Reflective Poetry. Transcendentalist Poetry: This style is very difficult because it requires creativity. You might have the urge to write a poem based on a person or an idea that you have, but you shouldn't waste your time on this. It's much more likely that you'll get a poem that sounds good or that has a particular poetic feel in a poem based on a person or an idea. Poetic verse (also called metapoesy): This style consists of verse that is more complex than verse but still can be read as a poem. It's a combination of stanzas, rhyme schemes, and meter. You might choose to write in stanzas or rhyme schemes, depending on the stanza format. If you want to write a poem, there is only one thing that's necessary to do: Come up with some ideas. You have to come up with some poems to practice with as you come up with new ideas. Your creativity is your best..."," Here are some simple tips to help you make your poetry more like a song:    - Use the metrical structure of a song. Don't write every sentence like a poem. You could use stanzas or even paragraphs. Use rhymes, but the point is not so much to make up new ones - some of the best writers do the same old ones. - Don't just jump into a poem. Write out the thoughts you have until you have them as an outline. After that, dive in and just start. Write your poem, adding lines, words, as much as you like. Don't worry about grammar. Don't think of it as if you had to make a poem up. - Have fun. It doesn't have to be serious, but try to have fun while you're writing. You don't need to start making friends, it's alright if you're just writing for yourself. Do it for fun. Don't worry about grammar or structure - just let yourself enjoy it. - Don't write as if you had to impress anyone. Keep in mind that a poem isn't a test, and it's better to make it entertaining than to impress someone. - Use only a very small portion of the poem. A good poem is usually about 10-15 lines at most."," The key to making a good poem is to be sure to keep your eyes open and your ears listening. The writer will have to make sense of his /her own words, the words of others, and the words that are in nature. The poet will then feel able to translate his / her emotions, feelings, and ideas into his /her words, so that they become a full form. It may take years to learn how to write poetry, but it will eventually become a natural part of our life. Make a beginning poem."," And the truth is, there's no one who can tell you how to write poetry except you.

But they are not the only one who have risen up to be a symbol of the modern age. I asked some people for their ideas of what it means to them."," The wren was once a common bird of our home garden but it was once so fearful that it was kept on display to frighten away evil spirits. There are other species of wren that still live in many parts of our planet - but many of the wren species now have disappeared over the last few decades. In the UK, almost 200 wren species can now be seen. A recent study has shown that our relationship to the wren is becoming more complex. When a bird is an important member of the food chain it can be an important source of food so for centuries, it was considered the first warning bell. But we are becoming more aware that birds can also communicate emotionally. We used to view birds with suspicion because they flew too high and were too far gone. But new research suggests that there is something about some birds - their way of looking or their behaviour - that can show us something about what goes on inside our own mind. And so we should never assume that a bird is just there as an object, an object of curiosity but an important part of our social life. The wren, as the name implies, is a little bird, but also a bird of some importance. In the New Testament, a special word for wren is used, not to mean a bird but to mean the angel of light. We should know that wren is an angel of light who brings us the good news of the resurrection - a message that has so profound resonance today. In the Old Testament a wren is used to describe the angel Gabriel who brings an angelic voice to speak to Moses at Mount Sinai to make Moses 'understand the scriptures'. In both the New Testament and in the Old Testament the wren is an angel of light who wears light clothing - but today, in the time of our own personal struggles, we can look to it and know that the wren can bring us the message of hope and peace. In the Old Testament God made the wren into a symbol of the Lord, so he makes a symbol of our relationship with him."," The story is told in the words of the author of the wren, a local landowner who is keen to speak to young people. Question: What does the author of the wren want to talk to young people?"," ""
The wren, the white bird, has an important place in human culture. Some people consider it to be an evil spirit and it is believed that wren can give a person's fortune. Other people think wren can be a sign of bad luck. In many cultures it is a symbol of the winter solstice, a time when the sun goes down the longest and people pray to the sun. In the United Kingdom, the British Royal Academy of Arts & Letters (BRAAL) commissioned the artist David Hockney to create a portrait of a wren in 1969."," The wren has been a symbol of hope over the centuries, and has even inspired us to write love poems. So how does it work, what do we learn from our most loved bird?"," A bird of greatness in the culture of human beings. In his essay, Charles M. Parker reminds us of the importance of birds in the Western culture. It is the reason that they were depicted in sacred art, they were placed in ceremonial rituals and they had myths created around them, they were placed in religious ceremonies to pray to. For Parker, birds had a way to communicate our fears and desires. Parker reminds us of birds in the Eastern culture are also of great importance as they also have a role in communication, but they are not as important as the birds in the Western culture. It is also mentioned by Parker that all creatures in the world are the same - they all communicate. In Parker's view, birds have a special status within the human world. They are symbols of strength and beauty as they symbolized wisdom. Parker reminds us of the importance of birds in the Eastern culture.

I don't remember a scene in a recent novel where I spent more than a dozen minutes reading over the scene before trying to fit the narrator and main character into a scene.

If the novels of James Joyce and James Hilton were so different despite the fact that they both worked on the same screenwriter's desk, did their narratives differ?

Choose a story and decide how to tell it.," I am currently preparing a film adaptation of the famous Dickens novel, 'Oliver Twist', and have been reading through the scenes using the same approach."," My friend suggested that I consult a Flesch-Kincaid Grade level table. I searched for it in the internet, read it, and figured I could use it to determine whether or not there was room for further deletions in a script. I did it the first time. After it was a second time, I took a look at what I wrote and wondered if I still knew what I was talking about. I felt silly. There are people who are experts at writing and have developed scales to measure language ability. What I had done, I knew, was just plain stupid. I have a degree from Cambridge University in English Literature. I have also worked in journalism for four years, and when I was 16 years old, I studied film directing at New York University. I have to admit it was quite difficult for me to follow the Flesch-Kincaid Grade level table. It is just too complex to measure every aspect of the writing of every sentence. And in my experience, even though language is the way that the people communicate, it is not, in itself, the writer. It is the reader who makes the connection between what the writer wrote and what they want to hear. The fact that language can be a distraction from what the author wrote, I believe, is not as complex as many of us would like to believe. This is a simple yet important thing to realize, if you really want to be a great film writer."," So I decided to write a play out these ideas. Each of the three scenes in the play was to be told using short dialogue and simple action. The first scene had an opening which told the audience who the story was about, the second scene dealt with who was being haunted and the third scene gave a simple summary of the plot."
C2," This will change our world as we know it today and create changes to many of our lives. One of the most important aspects of global warming is that it will probably change the location of some parts of the world. The changes will affect parts of the world in which there are humans, as well as the wildlife. The heat is on It is hard to imagine a world without the sun. As global warming increases the earth’s temperature the heat will also increase in all parts of the world. In the future we may face dangerous heat waves.", It is even possible that the Earth will be able to hold on to life on Earth for more than 2 million years. This new environment is warm and moist and will lead to changes in everything from the climate to ocean water levels.," But what changes could happen for the humans when they start to live in a warmer world? Most likely, more heatwaves may occur. Temperatures in the world are rising."," For example, the heat will increase in the summer. In the future, we can probably expect to see extreme temperatures and a drastic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. In the past, global warming has already started to occur. For example, the year 2013 was very hot and humid in the United States."," For example, droughts and floods in the tropics will be more likely. The heat is on. Students will not be able to find all the information they will need in this passage, so they will need to do research on the internet to find the answers. In which part of the world would you see this text? English", The sentences will be about global warming so the total sentence count will be quite high. The text is very difficult to read and understand because of the high level of words and very few sentences. The text is not readable by Grade 1 learners as their Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 2.5.," One of the biggest changes will be more frequent storms: The weather is expected to be very rough. The heat is on. We know that many of the changes will be localised to particular parts of the world. The changes will probably affect your daily life as you travel, shop, work and play."
C2, Maps show the relations between parts of the earth. Maps express relations on the earth. They show where the earth lies in space and relations between the parts of it. Relations include distance and direction. Maps are the only way of displaying relations because it is impossible to draw relations graphically. The word “map” is not often used for geographical relations.," The purpose of a map is to display information about a place and the relationships between the features of interest in that place. Location The purpose of a location is to provide a physical location of a feature, or objects in the world. Location provides information about a place and the relationships between the features of interest."," So what makes the world go around? You could start with the size and shape of the earth’s surface. But then, what makes it go around?"," A map is useful to know the distance between two points by finding the number of degrees between two points on the map. Also, a map helps you to represent locations on the surface of the earth. It is very important to know all relations between points. The type of relationship is the most important part of a map."," To help with this, maps are often illustrated using symbols. The following map shows the relation between the locations on the earth’s surface where a storm system is likely to occur.", Total words = 2.5 total syllables Total sentences = 10 total words total sentences = 2.6 total syllables The maps are shown in order from top down and from left to right.," The map may be used to describe how the earth is or have been shaped by human action. Maps are produced in order to be used by man, not to explain how the earth actually is or has been shaped by human action."
C2," Shackleton is famous for having survived the Antarctic winter in 1915 by floating a floating base, with the help of a dog and two dogs that he found on an iceberg. But his extraordinary story has other dimensions, says George Osborne, chairman of the CBI (the business lobby) in Britain. He describes Shackleton as a man of few words and great courage. A 'people person', a 'caring person', a 'loving person,' and a 'gentleman'. Osborne says: Shackleton was born in Norway in 1889 to an ordinary working class father and mother. At 16, he joined the Royal Naval Reserve and was killed while serving a year in an Arctic training ship in 1909. His great-great grandson Richard is a famous actor. Shackleton's story is not that of a business executive but of a man who, for all his success, never forgot the basics. He lived to be an 83 year old in 1998. But business leaders are seeking a modern Ernest Shackleton. What is so impressive about his story is that he was a business person, despite his background. And that he survived the world's coldest winter on foot. Osborne says people have a very negative view of business life. They think that business is dead and business is not for everybody. This attitude is becoming increasingly more popular in Britain. He is trying to bring together a business community of business people who want to see business in Britain become more popular. Osborne is trying to get business people to take a positive approach to their work. The CBI is taking a leading role in supporting business people who are in business to give their best to serve business in Britain. Osborne says many business people would rather work in the private sector for small firms than for large companies. He believes that a business person, at a very senior level, in Britain should be as important as a politician or a lawyer. Osborne hopes the business people will inspire British business to thrive and compete with the rest of the world. But Osborne says the government should do much more. Osborne says that the government has not been doing enough to support..."," However, only the most savvy executives in the UK and in Canada know how to succeed. They will not have Ernest Shackleton's background but will draw on his qualities to help them succeed. I have a friend who is an accountant and is the most savvy executive in Britain. She doesn't have Shackleton's background and is still on top of the business world. She comes to me every now and then and tells me what a difference her methods make. Shackleton, of course, would not want it to be known that he was an accountant and would have wanted others to respect his integrity. People are used to seeing a man who can manage a big organization and who has a strong sense of responsibility. While many people get a lot out of Ernest Shackleton's leadership, few of us get to benefit from his accountant background. In my office today there are four people in the top 30 in their field. Two are accountants, one is a lawyer and another is a marketing and communications director. I wonder how many accountants are in those 30 companies. They certainly haven't used Ernest Shackleton's strength in this area. This is a great example of where Shackleton could be a useful resource."," But what does the word ""person"" mean? In English we are usually speaking of things individually. But when we use the word in any sentence, we are usually talking of a group of people with some relation to what is being described. This is how to form sentences and be a good person. How should people behave and what is the best way to behave? The polar explorer Ernest Shackleton is a good example."," But as an editor, it's the first time I've learned how to write his biography. I've always been fascinated by the polar explorer and his role in Antarctica. The latest film, Antarctica, is my favourite film. This is an important book, because it's not one for a child to read at home. It's intended for adults reading it for their job or personal learning. There are many different meanings of the word 'polar explorer'. They can be professional, or the polar explorer that made history with the discovery of the North Pole and North East coastline. It also applies to explorer of Antarctica. Shackleton is one of the most famous men in history. You read his life in books written by his granddaughter, and you can go to the British Library for an extensive archive on Shackleton. But I'm reading this book for its meaning in the corporate world. Shackleton was a person in charge of a British ship and people, with a sense of humour. He was known for his work ethic and personality. He died during an attempt to cross the Antarctic. He went up as far as he could, on his ship, to prove what was possible, and then he died. His hero status helped him establish his authority. He had a different conception of a good leader. A good leader should go up, up and away, and leave a successful legacy. To be in charge is to lead and lead well, but it doesn't always mean to follow well. Ernest Shackleton was like that. He went far above the average man and woman to prove that it was possible. Shackleton was a man who challenged the status quo. He had a strong and unbreakable conviction that he had found the North Pole. This is a man with a sense of humour, because he was very unforgiving with the man who broke his trust. His sense of humour was very much rooted in his belief that there was no end to the north. He..."," But most of us don't know who his British counterpart, Shackleton, was. I was told recently he may not have lived long enough to make the same impact in the UK as his compatriot."," However, Flesch-Kincaid graders in America think he wrote best-selling children's books rather than historical fiction. They rated his works, The North and The Frozen Planet, based on words, total sentences, and total syllables. In Britain, he is known for his novels in which he was a polar explorer. His work is called The Wind in His Hair. According to Flesch-Kincaid graders, the words (word count) should always be based on the text size, not words per sentence (total words in sentence) which has never been considered a valid standard. As a result, the word count in The Frozen Planet is estimated at over 11,000. Although it will be more in agreement with readers of British novels, this gives the text a very narrow view of Shackleton. It is unclear how he managed his ships to reach the north pole in the same environment he described in his novels. As a result, The Wind in His Hair is likely to attract a lower number of readers. Shackleton's work is an example of how words have a much larger impact on a text than the sentence length or total number of words."," But what is new is a new version of Shackleton's personality that is now being promoted. A British man, who spent four years in the Antarctic, is a model of good management in the new campaign, according to people in Britain. Question: What do people learn? basic sentence patterns with memorised phrases"
C2," This has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the possibilities for access to music in recent years. We now have several means of recording music without having to go to the studio and, thanks to the developments in electronics and software, the listening experience is more varied and exciting, but at the same time it also presents new challenges to the listener. In the years ahead technological advances continue to transform our lives at work at home and in our leisure activities, and we will see continued development in both the forms of recording music and the way we listen to it. In recent years a number of innovations have come out of the laboratory as a result of new techniques in recording and storage techniques. We can now listen to music at work while working at home or while playing sport for example. However technological advances are changing the nature of what the listener wants from music. What is happening with the media - how are you recording music, what are your sources and how are you storing them? I would love to know your opinions about the future of the way we record music. Susan Hallam - BBC News"," Although these methods were a boon many people said that they were too complex and sometimes too loud or too distracting to be suitable for listening to music while doing other activities. It was believed that the best form of listening to music would be in the setting of the home as people were able to set the volume according to their own comfort level. But while technological advances are changing the way that we communicate and learn music has faced a set of challenges which have included the introduction of other formats such as online access and downloadable music downloads and the use of multi-media devices in many other areas of life. The impact of these challenges has been to alter the way we communicate with music and the place that music plays within the individual's life. Susan Hallam  introduces this topic by asking questions including: ""what can we learn from this passage?"" What might be gained from the introduction of technology in the form of new formats to listen to music?"," As a result many different kinds of music became readily available and became part of our everyday lives. As the range of available music expanded so did the repertoire available as well. The music industry expanded dramatically. Today we are very fortunate to have access to the most extensive library of music ever assembled. In the UK about half a million people own a recording of a popular classical CD for which there is no record of having played it before. In the UK about a quarter of a million people own a recording of a popular popular rock or pop CD. In the UK a quarter of a million people own a CD of music for children. About a fifth of a million people own a CD of music for orchestral performance. About a third of a million people own a CD of music for ballet. And a fifth of a million people own a CD of music for popular classical. In all there are probably 10 million people in the UK who own a recording of a classical CD. Most of them will not have seen it before. But not everyone has it. There are some ten thousand albums of music not available in the UK, most of which were released outside the UK, and which are owned by many Britons living abroad. Most of these albums are not widely available here in the UK either. It is not always easy to obtain them especially if you live abroad and you do not own a British passport. One of the most significant new developments was the introduction of digital music records and music reproduction in the form of digital music files which can easily be accessed through computers and iPods. A record of music of an artist whose name or title you do not recognize may be played on your computer or iPod. This new format is...", In the first part of the century music was a relatively limited presence on Britain's cultural map. By the early 21st century it had become central to the culture landscape and the cultural experience. The challenge ahead for music is to maintain its presence in society and on the musical map., This new medium changed our way of listening to music. How has this changed? Susan Hallam  writes this text for students in CEFR A1-C2., In Britain about 25% of the children aged between 8 and 14 are exposed to music daily compared to 12% ten years ago.  Music  - The Challenge Ahead, These developments have a number of benefits. First of all they make it possible to listen to a more range of music. The speed with which changes can be added also provides us with an interesting opportunity to develop a taste for new music as it emerges. However some of the changes have brought along their drawbacks. For example the growth of these listening devices has led to an increased dependence on technology. The development and growth of the internet has also had a number of implications in terms of our personal lives. The internet provides the opportunity for people to meet and talk together in the same space. This has led to the development of new forms of social interaction and communication with a friend or neighbour. But the Internet has also led to new concerns in the way we control our personal privacy and control over personal data. Music - The Challenge Ahead Technology is transforming the way people listen to music. The pace of growth is at a remarkable rate. We are spending many more hours per week listening to music through various devices than at any time in the past. We are entering a new era in the use of music. The digital revolution has opened up many more opportunities for musicians to express themselves. However it also poses new challenges for musicians and listeners as music becomes increasingly linked to our electronic devices. One problem concerns the amount of time it takes for music to be encoded and transmitted between computers and sound equipment. To meet the needs of a wider range of listeners the development of new formats is under way.

Dad got in the car and we were in the middle of a conversation when she started singing something. It was a love song, French in French and in her voice, French in her voice. Dad was in an instant. He said to me, ‘Look, this is no good, she’s a bad girl, and I know her. She’s in love with her ex boyfriend, she only moved out to see him. She should have stayed with her boyfriend.’"," My car was left in the car park in the middle of the road. We had stopped at the shop to buy a few more clothes for our trip. My Dad had just put the trunk in the car and told me to keep it locked. Dad said the shop lady at the shop had been looking at the car, and said it was time I went back home. Dad then turned to Maurice, saying, “Look here!” His little brother was wiping his eye. Mommy had just given a small kiss and told him to kiss me. Mommy had looked up at me. Dad was clearly flattered. Dad's words were: ‘Hey, kid, that would be worth a kiss’. I looked at my brother, I was embarrassed. ‘My clothes weren’t perfect’ I was saying to my brother. ‘I know, I know’ said my brother. Dad said, ‘That’s a pretty good move, kid, you’re not that bright.’ He smiled and said, ‘Oh look, don’t get too cocky, you’re only a Grade 2 boy.’ Dad continued to chuckle, ‘What a funny kid you are!’ Dad then laughed loudly, and said, ‘Here you go, kid, buy yourself a new car.’ My Dad said ‘Hey kid, your car looks good’. My brother Maurice did not appear too impressed with his new purchase. Dad smiled, ‘Here’s your car. You can take care of it, that’s not too much work’. Dad then went to collect some money from my mother and put it in my pocket. He turned around and said ‘Here, kid, give me something to read’."," I thought the family had a nice life. All that changed when I opened the trunk. The first thing I saw was a strange pair of old gloves. I was in awe! They were pink! My father's mouth dropped and his mouth grew wide. He pulled on his sunglasses, his red cardigan and he walked out of the car."," My Dad was furious: 'Here it is' He gave a loud sigh, pulled the seatbelt tight and shouted loudly at the windscreen wipers to keep us on course for the next hill! He was a stubborn old man who had an opinion about everything. When they arrived I did something that annoyed him so much that he said something to which I replied that I didn't want to do anything that would offend him. ‘You know what you want to do?’ he said. I said I thought he had the wrong idea about my actions and that I wanted my brother to know how my sister and I felt. He said he didn't need to know. We drove on for half an hour, which was enough time for the windscreen wipers to come back on to let us pass. When I got home that evening I thought about what had happened. When Maurice went back to his room to get something to write on a notepad, I told him what had happened. He said something that really hurt me. ‘If you had done what Dad wanted you to, I wouldn’t have been home for two years.’ I was so angry, I had to tell him the truth. I thought that I had a right to tell what I thought and felt, and that he didn't need to judge me. He apologised for the way he had spoken to me. He said he had meant nothing by what he said.

C2, How it is that this community thrives in such a varied culture is largely to do with its tolerance and openness. Aside from the city life Vancouver has also opened up in recent years to all types of cultures around the world. The result is a thriving and welcoming community which is largely not due to any cultural or religious preference but solely a combination of tolerance and openness," As someone whose language is not French or German I can easily understand how the newcomers to Vancouver enjoy the variety of spoken languages. But to a native English speaker like me I find the language variety very overwhelming. One night we walked in the direction of an old ferry dock that used to lie just south of the town centre. There were already people lining the street and some people chatting amongst themselves. Looking up the hill we found a group of people singing the same song in their native tongue. The song was the same in all of the languages that were in the group. English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese. It was the first time that I'd heard the song and was utterly mesmerised. The group were singing what looked like a religious song in a language that looked like Chinese. The song wasn't really about singing for religious reasons but for pleasure and happiness. If these people were truly happy they probably wouldn't be singing the same song each evening. The next day I tried to remember what the song was all about. I remembered the first evening I was listening to the song and that in the end the songs were sung in different languages. I couldn't bring myself to understand the true meaning. What was true was that the songs were sung in the same way each evening and every evening. They couldn't have known what the song was all about either but they certainly knew that it was joyous. It took me a while to realise that in this city of ours there is only one language that is truly spoken and that's English. It is this language that most of us associate with the words happiness and freedom. If someone was singing the same song in a different language it would not be about happiness, it would be about a sense of power and control. Vancouver is an extremely cosmopolitan city but as I walked up the...", The reason for this is that Vancouver has a huge influx of foreign workers. In recent years this has led to the global need for people to learn this language in order to communicate. Today you may hear someone speaking Mexican Spanish or even French!," How can you tell which people speak what language? They usually use different signs and gestures to communicate, such as the use of different pen strokes, gestures and slips. These kinds of signs are called slang, the slang term for an English dialect.   How do people from different countries communicate with each other?

Slang is used when they cannot use an exact word in English. For example, in Vancouver some people speak a different slang term for ""people"". In one particular street, people talk about their family members rather than using a standard term for people. How can you tell? Look for the distinctive use of ""people"".

C2, And a place where one can find great music is the theatre itself. Not in the wings as with the national opera house. Just a few hours of your life in a theatre would be the ticket for something of a lifetime.," But at the same time I have to admit that the most interesting theatre productions in recent times are almost always those that have combined musical and dramatic elements. The music is often very effective and when the acting is good the result is an entertaining theatre production. However, for some performances, the presence of music is far more intricate than is the performance itself. A performance is more exciting when the performer is completely submerged in her own thoughts and not aware that the audience is watching. In this respect I couldn’t agree more with Mr. Lean. When I first heard he’d been knighted my initial reaction was to ask him how he managed to be knighted. In truth he does not seem to mind it. His sense of humour and his ability to take risks are much appreciated by the British public and his name is in the headlines every week. For those not familiar with his background in politics the name is the reverse of Lean. Mr. Lean is more of the old-fashioned type with a long career in politics. For those of us who are not familiar with the political scene there is a whole world to discover. The fact that he became the first person to hold the office of British Chancellor suggests that Mr. Lean is a sensible and learned man. However, there are many more characters who are in fact more interested in their political careers than in public service. In fact in many parts of our current political scene we may find many of the people who hold high political positions have little regard for the public good. I hope this will lead to more people who want to work towards building a great Britain for the benefit of our citizens. The story should be a bit like the book called The Minister. What you get at the end is not what you paid for. In..."," That said, my love for music is very deep. Most of my life I spent learning about music. My parents are musicians. One of my earliest memories is of an orchestra in my parents’ house playing on the patio in the summertime. I remember being enthralled with their music. The music itself inspired a love for opera. The music used in opera is often very beautiful music. And like so much of music, it is also a reflection of the artist’s life. For me, music is not just another form of art, it is a reflection of myself as a person. In my opinion, it is a source of self expression and even more importantly it allows us to share our feelings and beliefs."," Opera is a music-based art form, and musical theater a sound-based form. Both of which rely heavily on the visual cues to bring together. But then opera was first and now music and theatre are working together. The opera house was my first experience with these two forms. I now like both so much. However my view on the subject is that opera is first and foremost a theater.", Music is the fundamental creative resource of theatre. Opera is but the special case. Theatrical performances were the main reason for going to the opera house and what was special about it was that I saw plays and then also musicals as well as opera there. After that I realised that I still enjoyed watching theatre more than opera. So I changed my opinion. I love opera more than theatre. I like it because I like the performance. I love the music and the acting and the set too.," But more than any other part of theatre, the music can dominate a performance and even dominate a performance and dominate a performance. Now, as I am on stage I use the music to give the performance its tone and its mood and its mood. The music also gives the performance its focus."," The music of Wagner.

C2," And that is the idea of the seed broadcasting: it was a common idea at the turn of the 17th century. The seed broadcasting metaphor has been around in society since it originated in agriculture. A seed is not just something to grow; it is a vital part of the starting process of a variety of plants, in the agriculture and ecology industries, but also many areas in business and human life, and some of these areas in fact use the metaphor. In this collection of essays, some authors discuss this metaphor and why it matters to them. Many social scientists, philosophers and educators use seed broadcasting as a metaphor for human action."," Broadcasting is about spreading or disseminating information. Today, most broadcasts are being produced and distributed by an interrelated set of networks and digital systems. Broadcasting is also called broadcasting because it is broadcast to people through the media by using broadcast satellite."," In other words it is a metaphor for growth and learning. Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology 'Broadcasting' - The Future of Education by George Steinkopff, George A. Steinkopff and James P. West, Routledge, UK 2004, ISBN 0-521-07419-6 1. In the 1980s 'broadcasting' referred to computer networks. A typical broadcasting metaphor was the seed or seedling. A broadcasting concept was originally meant to represent the social formation of technology, rather than technology itself. 2. A broadcasting metaphor means to gather together the various components or sub-processes to grow a particular thing. 3. According to the metaphor, to produce a single seedling in the field of education would be to gather together a small set of sub-processes, such as curriculum planning, teacher training, learning assessments, online learning, etc. All of these together could make a single plant in the field of education. In the case of the small seedling, the growth of a successful seedling would not be the most significant thing in the process. A successful plant would be the product of the whole set of sub-processes and the outcome of the process in itself. 4. The result of growth or cultivation (seedling metaphor) was not the focus of the process but the process itself (broadcasting metaphor). 5. If the conditions were right, the growth of the broadcast would be rich."," It is in a way the seed broadcasted on television: you can't take it in, but it grows. Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology 'Broadcasting', by Peter Sloterdijk, is published by Penguin (ISBN: 978-1-415-06695-4) At the same time the technological advance is spreading over the world, its spread is determined by the power of the technology as much as the technological conditions in which it becomes a dominant technology. It seems to be no longer possible for the technology to act independently from the world in which it is situated. Technological reproduction is always determined by the context in which it is embedded. The transmission of the technological image is determined by the power structure of society, not merely in which it is a dominating image. Sloterdijk argues that the technology is no longer able to act without it being connected to the outside world. The broadcast is the result of an expansion in the network of social relations and the spreading of social values. Social reproduction - not only material reproduction - depends on it. Sloterdijk refers to these new social reproduction relations which include networks of technical expertise, and argues that technological reproduction is a process of social reproduction. According to Sloterdijk, these new social reproduction relations change the reproduction of the social subject. This creates a society which has a new image which depends on the image it projects itself on the outside. This new image creates an increased power. It forms a new system of power and technology which is used to dominate a society. This is a kind of technology that is not controlled but controlled by the people who live in a society. It is one of the sources of inequality. It is not one of the sources of wealth, but of inequality. It is the result of an increase in the power of the social subject, so that...", In its broadest meaning broadcast could be defined as the use of technology to disseminate information to a large audience by means of the mass media. Nowadays it means communication for business: broadcasting companies. Broadcasting means sowing seeds broadly by hand. It is in other words not only an agricultural metaphor it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles the production if the conditions are right of a rich harvest. In its broadest meaning broadcast could be defined as the use of technology to disseminate information to a large audience by means of the mass media. Nowadays it means communication for business: broadcasting companies," It is a broadcasting that requires no special equipment, simply broad-spectrum equipment and the ability to broadcast broadly. The term was coined by a radio announcer for a piece of news he broadcast. The term is not necessarily appropriate for all types of broadcasting, although it is often used. TITLE: The title for a novel or play is intended to attract readers and listeners. However, if the subject of a novel or play are familiar or well known, then the title can become a cliché. An example of a cliché is The Lost Village. The title for a movie is intended to give a glimpse of the nature of the film. For example, a movie about an investigation into the demise of a small mining town has an interesting title. SYLLABLE: One way or another the total number of syllables in a sentence, paragraph or passage is important to the Flesch-Kincaid grade scale. The total number of syllables, syllabic words, and total number of words used make up the total number of words. The total number of words includes all proper nouns, verbs and adjectives, and any other nouns and words that can be used in any sentence or passage. SENTENCE: Sentences, paragraph, and passage are also made up of words. The total number of sentences is equal to the number of words plus the number of sentences plus the number of words used. All of the following count as words:   The subject A sentence The preposition A period A conjunction A commas"," Broadcaster: In some senses, broadcasting is simply a metaphor referring to an idea and its promotion, with a narrower focus compared to the other metaphors. EXPRESSION: Expressing oneself in writing is a form of communication. However, if you are writing about yourself and others, this can be quite difficult. EXERCISE: Sport is a form of exercise, which does not have clear rules and regulations for its participants. EXCELLENCE: According to Aristotle, excellence is the result of practice."
C2," Frank Kermode, review-writing A Practical Guide for Editors and Writers, ed. Michael Shapiro, Oxford University Press (2005). As for reviews, these short lives are the result of the writer’s desire to see a book or a movie be widely read and to earn income from selling it."," You can assume it has been reviewed, at least in part, at some point in the past. A few may have been revised because of complaints from the writer, but usually the review isn’t touched. A short form that summarizes the best and worst. One is not a judge, but a spectator. The review is a piece of work, but a work with very little of the character and purpose of the original work. I have only read this book by a friend who has already read the first. I have to agree that it is less than the first book, especially in terms of the tone of the writing. It is more than a review, perhaps, though. It is a critique. And it is, frankly, unbelievably well-written. I believe it has merit of its own, which is not what most critics say. I think it should have earned a more extensive book, and I think it should have been published earlier, and I think it would have been worth more."," If their reviews serve the purpose they were written to serve, they are often quite readable. However the purpose is often elusive. To write meaningful reviews and to keep these reviews active in the market, the reviewer must be open to the potential dangers in reviewing. Frank Kermode teaches courses in review-writing at The New School"," They are usually used to demonstrate new products. How do you write reviews that are useful for readers? What is the point? To use this knowledge, the author develops some strategies for writing reviews. He then offers some suggestions for evaluating and using the strategies, and finally concludes with a list of resources."," The review-writer is usually in search of a quick job and an adequate payment. As such, the review-writer does little research in order to inform the review. There are two main types of reviews. They are content and topic-based reviews. The review-writer is looking for reviews that will help improve their job as an instructor."," Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale The total words and syllables in a text contribute to how well that text is read. The more total words and syllables in a text, the better that text is read. Text Size The number of sentences in a text influences how much that text is read."," But that doesn’t mean they’re bad. The purpose of these reviews is to provide a useful guide for the writer, to see where the book went and how it went, to see where the writer should improve and what to expect from the next edition. You don’t have to memorise, but you can learn from the reviews which have been written by successful writers. In this way they give you pointers and help you to write your own reviews. In this case Frank is discussing his own experience and that of others. The second task in writing reviews is to remember details from the book or film. This information must be in the book or the film in order to be useful. The only thing you don’t want to forget is your own opinion on the book or the film."

A lot of work had to be done on the film itself, but it was much better received by American viewers than it had been by the critics. The actor play by Edward Furlong was a bit of a lousy joke, but it was the story, the themes and the performances which made Citizen Kane a great movie. It did have flaws, but these were few and far between."," Who plays Billy Elliot in the musical Billy Elliot The musical Billy Elliot takes place in London during the late 1930s, during the Great Depression.

C2, It is believed that in medieval times people had little or no access to coffee and tea but enjoyed a substantial breakfast as part of a full day of travel and labour.," In the early Middle Ages, a lot of people ate something that was similar to a breakfast you would find today. The main food of choice was porridge or cereals. It was believed that eating bread throughout the day made one feeble and sick. A good morning meal in the Middle Ages was more about comfort and being well nourished than about looking skinny. In fact, you could get fatter at the same time. In the early Middle Ages, there were also many other traditions that we associate with the mornings of today, including the eating of meat, drink and the wearing of the white coat. While you will find many examples from medieval literature of breakfast, it is very common for people to have them in the first place. In medieval England, the first people to consume a rich breakfast were the priests. During the first millennium, the priests of the Catholic Church were given special access to a breakfast in the form of rich food.", We know what this means; this is the dawn of history. But this is not all there was. The history of breakfast has also gone far beyond the kitchen.," But in the time after Edward VI’s death in 1453 , the concept of breakfast spread across the country and the Royal Kitchen – the state kitchen of England  – began to introduce a whole host of foods new to the country."," As a result, English may be a language of the past. This is not to belittle the importance of breakfast. Many studies have shown a strong link between breakfast and health . However, the history of breakfast in England is one of pioneering ideas. Many of the first words that were written about breakfast were published in the early nineteenth century. Some of the earliest books to discuss the importance of a good breakfast were published before meals began to disappear. These included 'The Joy of Breakfast' by Joseph Butler (1778) and his brother John Butler (1779) and 'Some of the Customs of the House and Family to be observed at Breakfast' by George Routledge (1788). The publication of George Routledge's work marked the first time breakfast was pictured on the menu for restaurants and public eating establishments. A study of food history suggests that the concept of breakfast had also emerged earlier in Europe and North America, although food historians disagree on its true dates. For example, 'The Delights of Breakfast' by Sir John Sloane (1773) is said to be the first book to be written specifically about breakfast. It was published in the UK a year before George Routledge's book. However, Sloane’s work appears to be more concerned with the luxury aspects of breakfast, rather than its importance to health. These works were printed for the use of the educated middle classes. Over the next century, several more works emerged promoting the importance of breakfast. A work by James Watt (1768) was published in 1787 which was probably a review of..."," The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale considers the total words, total sentences, and total syllables in a text: The Flesch-Kincaid Grade scale considers the total words, total sentences, and total syllables in a text.
